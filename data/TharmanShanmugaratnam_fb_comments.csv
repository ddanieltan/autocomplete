1404770669552420_1422807757748711,"on monday, when singapore prime minister lee hsien loong touched down on japan, chinese air force projected a show of force near japan, to which japanese airforce jets scrambled. below is a press conference of china's foreign ministry while prime minister lee is in japan. prime minister lee needs all the diplomacy, skill, finesse, subtlety and tact to navigate his relations with china and japan while he is visiting japan and china is criticising singapore.
Q: Chinese media reported that, during the just concluded 17th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), Singapore along with a few other countries, irrespective of clear opposition from a majority of members, insisted on highlighting the South China Sea-related contents in the outcome document. Singapore recently said that these reports are groundless and fail to tell the facts. What is your comment?
A: We have noted relevant reports.
NAM is not a proper place to discuss the South China Sea issue. Its outcome document shall reflect the consensus of all the members based on the long-held principle of consensus upon consultation. The facts are clear. Individual countries insisted on highlighting the South China Sea-related contents in the outcome document, but failed in doing so, because they did not secure the approval of the majority of NAM members and these contents did not represent the consensus of parties related to the South China Sea issue, China being one party.
Thanks to the concerted efforts of China and ASEAN states, the current situation in the South China Sea is moving towards a positive direction. China hopes that relevant countries can respect China's stance and relevant consensus reached between China and ASEAN, uphold an objective and unbiased position, and make constructive contributions to the sound and steady development of China-ASEAN relations and the proper settlement of the South China Sea issue.
Q: Considering a series of reports on what happened during the 17th NAM Summit, will the friendly relationship between China and Singapore be affected?
A: China and Singapore established the All-Round Cooperative Partnership Progressing with the Times last year. I want to stress that on issues concerning the core interests and major concerns of the two sides, China and Singapore should understand and respect each other.",Toh Han Shih,1,2016-09-27 17:01:01

How I relate with our pioneer generations particularly our grandparent-ly pioneers are special as usual, in a nutshell they survived World War 2 and had stories to tell me or us about that our parents never did, that's all I needed to recall if I remember our older Pioneer Generations. The love is a very different level of love when somebody survives a war and lives to tell grandchildren. <3 Thank You Pioneer Generations and President Nathan.",Rongxiang Lin,0,2016-08-22 17:14:59

1381289975233823_1384921968203957,"My family, friends and I are deeply saddened by the news of the demise of the 6th President of Singapore, Mr. S. R. Nathan. 

He was an extraordinary man whose nature was down-to-earth, humble, kind hearted and of all a great man who marked religious, moral and social cohesion for the Nation, Community and Society. 

With great intellectual honesty, he did not hesitate to review the poverty for the needy and at the same time, he piloted streams of charity events to raise funds. 

Throughout he observed human beings in all dimensions in order to establish a new civilization that would be more realistic and enduring: the civilization of love. 

The loss of this great man who led an honourable life has made a deep impression on the minds and hearts of all Singaporeans. 

His vision of life was truly remarkable. His teachings and guidance also strengthened us and made us more determined to act with greater equity. These are the sentiments with which we should follow. 

We are all mourning this great man, with sincere grief, for we have lost the true friend of our human journey, and the sentiment we all feel in these days is profound loneliness. 

We would like to express our sincere Heartfelt Condolences on the loss of the great man and our hearts go out to the family of Mdm. Urmila, loved ones and extended families! 

May his divine soul be blessed and rest in peace! 

Death only comes to those who leave no memories; for whose existence was cherished, they will always be alive in the chambers of the heart. 

With Deepest Sympathy,

1380184205344400_1380184632011024,"I was shocked and worried when i saw the PM ""jerks"" and the right side of his face/lip ""pulled up"" like having a cramp.
 My heart was heavy and the feeling was like it's sinking into a bottomless ocean, I don""t know why but I just kept mumbling ""No, Please, No, Not again"". I glued to the TV waiting for updates, not on his speech but his condition.
 When I heard the announcement that PM is Ok and is going to continue with this ""very important"" National Day Rally....I got angry, and YES, ANGRY !!!
 I do not know what happened behind the scene, a powerful jab to allow th PM to continue ? A contingency plan (BCM) in place in an event something worst happens ?
 PM resumed his speech. ""Minister or not, we are all mortal"" - LHL 
 I started to texted one of my friend, and told him that I would like to put up a petition....that all Ministers and MPs should be well rested and even more so when they are not feeling well.
 They must always remember that they are people elected Members of Parliament.
 The people trusted them and gave them the mandate, hence, they must not betray the trust of the voters.
 They should take good care of themselves before they have the physical and mental capabilities to take care of the Nation and the people.
 I implore, Please.....
 This is a risk too risky for Singaporeans to absorb should the condition exacerbates.
 Yes, you are correct PM LHL, you gave us a scare, a scare to ponder in depth that upon your stumble, will Singapore tumble ?
 Please, to all of you, we voted you into parliament to give us security and not scares. 
 We understand it's not just the nation you are taking care of, it includes the regional and the global issues at large....
 Noentheless, have enough rest and take care of yourselves before you can take care of the Nation and the people.

Divine Discontent

Material things.

Simply wonderful.

He will need lots of rest under close observation by his medic team.

======

PM Lee said at the NDR:

Recently, somebody asked me at a dialogue ""If God appeared before you and asked you for three things that you would want for Singapore, what would these be?""

I was taken aback. I thought for a while and replied: If we wish for material things, we will regret it, because after we have got it, we will not be satisfied and we will want more. 

But what I would like is that we be blessed with a divine discontent - always dissatisfied with where we are; always driven to do better. 

And yet, that we have the wisdom to count our blessings, so that we know how precious Singapore is, and we know how to enjoy and protect it.

If just these two wishes are fulfilled, that will be enough. Then we can keep on building something special in Singapore for many more years, and ""Achieve Happiness, Prosperity, and Progress, for our nation"".

There is only one life, and the future of others doesn't change coz of you falling ill. 

I sincerely feel ashamed that we have a generation of ppl who think that thgs are supposed to be the way it is coz they were brought up in an environment where everything was given to them. 

Fainting during your SAFTI time? Sir, if anyone fainted during their SAFTI time, the army would hv been blamed for their incompetence of not looking into the safety of their cadets.

But how do we hv toughen the next generation and prepare them for the challenges ahead? Through soft training? 

Seeing you complete your speech yesterday reminds me of why Singapore is where we are, coz we hv a generation of ppl who hv seen the tough times. But how is the next generation going to face tough times if the going and the treatment they hv been given is all good?

I believe that the current DSA programme will work if everyone believes in exploring their children's talents. I hope that Singapore can also further these children's talents by ensuring we have good coaches and enough resources to train our talents for the world. I wonder if the SSS (Singapore Sports School) or other special schools are equipped enough to allow our talents to bloom. It is curious why Schooling did not choose SSS.  Perhaps there were better options out there. Nevertheless, do we give enough support to our local talents after they graduate from these schools?  And as school fees of these schools are expensive, do we have other options where our talents can turn to, because not every parent has that financial support to allow their children chase their dreams. Hopefully, we can groom more talents like Schooling in time to come.",Sze Ying,4,2016-08-14 10:19:27

For instance, karma suggests that if you lecture somebody ridiculously even if you are a Bodhisattva if you make a mistake somebody has to give you a slap. 

Same goes for Chee Soon Juan who has since disappeared once again. Mistakes are mistakes, whether of the gab or of the spiritual. You are like Chee, when you make a mistake you refuse to admit your transgression and you further abuse another being. What is my point?

1371241772905310_1371322272897260,"Mr Tharman, sir, may I post my one and only question left to our Singapore government. What are you planning to do after Joseph Schooling comes back to Singapore from Rios? Push him to National Service where his swimming training would ceases for 2 years long? I do hope that his daily swimming training continues, while he serves his duty in National Services. Keep in mind, the next goal is to break the world record in 100M Butterfly Swimming. By ceasing all daily swimming training would not help him reach this goal. I earnest hope the Singapore government hears and does something fruitful out of this result. Thanks. Found this from cyberpioneer, it wrote, ""Swimmer Joseph Schooling, Singapore's Sportsman of the Year in 2011, has been granted National Service (NS) deferment until 31 Aug 2016, so that he can continue training without disruption for the 2016 Summer Games.""",Joe Ong,12,2016-08-13 03:46:37

We welcome Mahathir's new party 

Salleh Said Keruak 

Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has finally admitted that the only way to change the government is in a general election. Of course, Mahathir will not admit that he is trying to change the government. He claims he is just trying to remove Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak to save Umno, Barisan Nasional and Malaysia. It is strange that someone would want to save the party that he claims he still loves by trying to destroy it. It is like saying that you want to save humanity by destroying the world. Anyway, there is no longer any doubt that Mahathir wants to form a new party plus launch a new opposition coalition so that he can defeat Umno and Barisan Nasional in the general election. 

And I personally welcome that move because at least it now makes Mahathir's stand very clear and prove that he is not trying to save Umno but to defeat Umno. 

Sometimes competition is good when it make you aware that unless you buck up and work harder you face the risk of defeat. Countries like Japan and Germany excelled because they had to struggle to survive whereas Empires such as Britain faded away due to rot and complacency. So maybe Mahathir is doing Umno and Barisan Nasional a favour by offering us some competition because competition is always good to see success.",Toh Han Shih,0,2016-07-31 07:23:34

our fellow countrymen? I felt so ashamed of myself for my ignorance of the faiths of our fellow S' poreans.  My knowledge is so limited and superficial e.g. mostly constrained to Muslims don't eat pork or many Hindus are vegetarian.

In the UK, a problem which I don't think singapore has, is that back home there are no legal repercussions if you lie during your campaign. Within hours of the leave win, the lure of $350 million being pumped into the NHS was revealed to not be true or possible.

The logic could be a simple one.  It is NOT about $$$.  If open borders in EU mean young voters voted for passport sake; accessibility (no pre-requisites) to any part of EU seeking employments; forsaking family nucleus and ties; leaving silver generations at home...then the outcome is a logical one.
The older, matured and wiser generations have voted not for their selfish sake but for molding future generations and protecting institutions (eg multi generation family) vital for UK sovereignty, family roots and identity. Open borders have unintended consequences; putting stresses and constraints on many family businesses, family trees and identity.  Families have become more nomadic and always on the roads or air.  People no longer can grow deep roots.  Brexit is a reality now.

If we study the matter hard enough, many mature democratic governments has failed to recognize the ""Seeded Expectations"" of  citizens.

Immigration seems to be the biggest topic in this new brew of politics. But also one key ingredient that helps anti-immigration sentiments thrive , is the government's failure to align expectations. It's not just the usual expectations that are promised year in year out or at every political campaign. But the seeds of expectations that were planted over the years since the birth of a child that follows through to his/her growing childhood right up to early adulthood. During the period of growing up, a child will get to learn about their rights and they may also develop aspirations base on the mold of society definition of success. In involve the society as a whole, from the parents and right up to the government, all would have some sort of an expectation from the child. Seeded expectation are the sort of expectations that grew up with you and remain within you.

Seeded expectations are more apparent in developed cities with competitive economy due to the availability of a ""formula of success"". People were told to follow a certain way of life to get the success they were yearning for. It could be hard work, or in the earlier 90's of Singapore context, the necessity of getting a degree. As a child all you need to do is to follow the formula and you will most likely get your success. Common sense will tell you that the more people does the same thing the more often then not the formula won't work as well as it intended to be. When something becomes common, the definition of success has change. The individual will then wonder what success is and how did I turned out to be someone common? Is there a sudden change in expectation? What did I do wrong all these years that I do not stand out?  This sort of situation will trigger a sense of frustration among these young adults, just like the seeds that were planted in them, the issue are deep and personal. (A voting trend that may define the current 30s and above because of the deep seeded expectations that has failed them for years) 

Immigration fundamentally rattles the seeded expectations. Many question will be left unanswered. A mid-career worker may question the hard work he has put in all these years while following the formula to achieve his/her aspiration of success but he/she will also notice the foreigner who bypass the ""system"" and receive something similar or a position higher then him/her at work. These mid-career workers will question the system.

A British example could be, I'm born a British and it's my every right to receive the social and welfare benefits payout for the hard work I had given to this country over the years. I have contributed my taxes and is due time for me to enjoy the benefits ..... but then why on earth are these immigrants or EU citizen enjoying the same benefits as me? How could they just bypass the formula or system? These people don't deserve a cent from our British system. 

It maybe the general sentiment of the older generation in Britain, educated or not.The majority felt they were loosing out and they had to act on a vote that benefits them. They may not understand the whole context of the consequence of leaving the EU.

Well in Singapore at least, we know that globalization and a declining birth rate in many developed cities has forced the hands of governments to accept immigrants.
Competition between countries, cities and maybe even businesses has played a role in recruiting talents from around the world. Governments has traded immigration for the better of a robust economy. But could they have also traded their votes because they may have neglected the ""seeded expectations"". 

When someone whom has dedicated his/her life all these years to attain something and when they reach that point of life to grab it but it isn't there, i think people will be frustrated and they will be angry. 

Tharman Shanmugaratnam I m not sure if what I called seeded expectation is something that has been studied or talked about before but I hope that the government is aware of it's existence. 

A sense of failure lurks around the individual when deep rooted expectations are not met. Emotions will precede over logic. The failure to meet expectations is always the number one reason for a breakup or divorce in any form of relationship.

People with the responsibility to devise immigration and population policies must plan with a very long horizon. 

It's the same with productivity and skills. These cannot be gained overnight. You cannot ask ""Where are the engineers?"" only when you need them. I have a suggestion to make. Why don't the Government give out scholarships for engineering and any other speciality that we need, not for use by the Government but for use by the private sector? Bond these scholars to work in these private organizations in their specialities of study and have the companies co-share the cost of the scholarships. The Government must be generous. Otherwise there will be no takers.",Loke Fook Seng,0,2016-06-25 12:09:37
1331060486923439_1331776293518525,"Corporations should not be allowed to expect more public welfare with yet another govt sponsored scholarship/bonds. Singapore has been successful with steering graduates of required qualifications. Many companies had worked with universities to award top performers a final year or a guaranteed position. 
We have no lack of engineers but who would not want to climb and achieve higher if they can? 
Retaining workers doesn't work with bonds. Retaining an employee unwilling to stay will not have productive outcome.

Retaining graduates or employees are multi-pronged which I find severely lacking especially in local managed organisations. Gratification at work via opportunities to gain experience, perform, to be appreciated openly can sometimes be powerful retention factors. Unfortunately local management are often (not all are) micro-managing, unappreciative and not very fair on remuneration (short-sighted) and with high tendency of rewarding  talkers than real achievers. 

Corporations are turning to foreign PMETS mainly for cost and obedience. Productivity often suffers. Other than complying with mandatory work safety and relevant laws, an employee should not be expected to be meek and obedient if you want diversity, creativity and high productivity. Learn to manage, not control your employees and be fair with sharing the rewards. That way, we wouldn't need so many migrant PMET workers.",Chin Lee,2,2016-06-25 13:57:54
1331060486923439_1332133086816179,"Although there are many engineering students but many end up doing non-engineering work. I am sure the same applies to other areas of expertise. Singapore does not have a culture of dedication in developing one's expertise. Many look for shortcuts to instant wealth and accordingly lead to a shortage of engineering expertise. 

Those who have the responsibility to recruit engineers face this problem of shortage and have to rely on foreign engineers, who could come with questionable certifications. It is not always a question of cost. When you advertise for a position a dozen times and not a single Singaporean or even a PR applies for the vacancy, cost is not the issue here. 

If we are not willing to think out of the box, we will continue to have to rely on foreign workers together with all the attendant problems that come with it, including, ironically, a higher cost of living. And this is not welfare or further contribution to the private enterprises because they will have to pay the local market prices for these scholars and moreover have to continue to recruit them for the duration of the bond. This carries a business risk. The bulk of the benefits of the scholarship goes to the student, answering to the complaint that  too many scholarships have gone to foreigners. Further, breaking the bond, on either side could incur penalties to be paid back to the Government. The Government simply pays for the scholarships to correct a resource imbalance. 

Without a solution to encourage local workers to fill vacancies of need, we will forever be dependent on an increasingly larger and larger number of immigrants. That is the market reality.",Loke Fook Seng,1,2016-06-26 00:31:43

The more extreme the establishment goes, the more the other end of the polarised society will want to go. The prolonged short-term and myopic, economy first and people as tools instead of people first and economy as tool. The reversal of the goal and the means has exacerbated the polarization. As such this is a very natural re-equilibration that no one should be surprised with. 
Immigration justified and referenced as a necessity as seen in history is a very selective and unrealistic way of argument for the sole purpose of (post Reagan/Thatcher's privatisation and free market policies) keeping labour cost on one end and shifting wealth to avoid taxes on the other. 
Less violent migration in history was into land that had plenty of opportunity for development (Malaysia, Singapore to name a few). Sovereign countries that were 'migrated into' in large numbers were often more violent than present days -eg Israel/Palestine, Rohingya/Myanmar. So the success/necessity of migrants esp in Singapore's history is not applicable to present Singapore. Immigrants can be introduced at a rate as fast as assimilation can take place. Migration that is too rapid will deter assimilation and build tension. This is natural human nature and to expect otherwise will require a society that is open minded and civically and politically, Singapore is drifting everyday further and further away from open mindedness. 
Brexit is a natural and necessary steering for UK. Just as a bubble economy, to reduce the impact, it is better to burst the bubble while it is small rather than to procrastinate for fear of a small ripple.

However, I couldn't say the same here. Many fear the unknowns and uncertainties which they will not visualise the weakening of the government and its consequences. Hence, the fear factor.

1331060486923439_1332542226775265,"Thanks to everyone, for this whole round of comments. Varying views, but it's clear that Brexit matters to all of us, well beyond the UK. And while there is great uncertainty ahead, it will take a while before Brexit's consequences become clear.                                 The demographic summary  - about who voted for the UK to remain or leave -  that's factual and has been reported extensively. It paints a picture of the broad social divides that showed up in the referendum. They will have implications for the future, and the thinking and ground politics of the major political parties in the UK - as is already being debated, post-referendum. 

But just to be clear -  the demographic generalisations obviously don't describe every voter in each category, as some of you have pointed out. A significant minority of the young, those with degrees, and those better-off, and even of the Scots, voted to leave. And a significant minority of older voters, those without degrees, and those less well-off, voted for UK to remain, against the general currents. More important, the statistics don't say who was wiser.   

It will take years before we know what the outcome of Brexit, economically and politically will be - for the UK and its constituent parts, and equally important for Europe. It will have relevance everywhere: The geopolitics that evolves from here (see for eg this opinion piece below). The lessons we each derive in our own settings - for policies that aim to preserve trust and inclusivity in society, even as we stay open to the world; a sense that everyone matters and must share in prosperity.  And critically, for how we strengthen the politics of reason, and the politics of the centre.  Let's keep our minds open.

There were also many intra-EU marriages and new families formed. But now all these have to relocate back to where they come from including the Brits having to move back to Britain as they would have lost their EU nationals Permanent Resident ship. 

Families may be torn asunder as is already happening with the gloomy prospect of both husband and wife from differing EU nations losing their PR. 

EU is not only financial but also social. They have this Permanent Residentship granted to any EU nationals who have stayed more than 5 years without any conditions attached and it is automatically renewable every 10 years also with no conditions. 

Those who fear integration like the EU or those who feel they are losing out are because they failed to make themselves mobile to explore the many opportunities that have been opened up for them in other EU nations.

1. The invocation of 'hate' has become a way of dismissing opponents by suggesting that their beliefs are beyond the reach of reason.

2. The anti-Brexit crowd cannot acknowledge that those who voted to leave may have done so out of legitimate concerns about sovereignty or economic opportunity or security ‚Äî that is, that they may have drawn rational conclusions and voted accordingly. 

3. Liberal cosmopolitanism has bought completely into its own rightness. It is entirely devoted to an increasingly borderless political future carefully managed by technocrats.. It sees no other alternative than that we will all, eventually, be ""citizens of the world,"" and assumes that everyone will be happier that way.

4. It's not unreasonable to think otherwise. Anti-EU movements and renewed nationalism in the United States are on the rise precisely because they offer alternatives to this self-assured order. It's not clear whether a United Kingdom withdrawn from the EU will be better off. But it's entirely defensible to think that it might be. 

5. Likewise, it's not unreasonable to prefer loyalties rooted in close-knit interactions among people who share a particular space and a particular history. Or to prefer local rule to government outsourced to distant bureaucracies. Or to prefer a richer sense of belonging than interaction in a common market. There are alternatives to a transnational super-state that are not fascism. 

6. The inability of our political leaders to envision political futures other than the one to which they are wedded has facilitated the polarization, and the unresponsiveness, of our politics. That people are now looking for alternatives is, in fact, entirely reasonable.

1331060486923439_1332545713441583,"""The left believes that we can only succeed if everyone succeeds and that globalism is the way to prosperity.

Immigration was a huge issue here as well just like it is in the United States.  The liberals in Britain were actively importing thousands of refugees into the country, from many different places, that were taking jobs away from working class Brits.  In fact, working class citizens were the driving force behind this decision to leave and Northern England delivered this victory to Brexit which is something that no one saw coming.

Liberals will tell you this is a sign things are falling apart. Don't listen to them.  The markets will correct as the people of Britain figure out their next move.  It won't be pretty, but Stockholm Syndrome isn't an excuse to not do the right thing.  This is a long term play.

But, this system was designed to make it difficult to leave and just because it will be tough in the beginning doesn't mean this isn't a good idea long term.

At the end of the day, Britain should rule Britain.  That's just common sense.""

1331060486923439_1332559850106836,"The EU started its economic grouping with six European countries in 1951 and grew over the years to 28 today. It is apparent from the comments of politicians and the common people, that the EU has expanded numerically but its protocols have not kept up correspondingly. The expanded EU is too big to manage having to contend with divergent needs, and differing national imperatives. Not a few enlightened political leaders within the EU have called for an overhaul of the EU's operational structure and mechanisms to align with its members' needs and perceptions. It must be acknowledged that extraneous factors like immigration policies regarding immigrants from the Middle-east are not well received by citizens of member countries. The years ahead are going to be bumpy and whether the EU will emerge stronger or weaker is uncertain. What is certain now is that the global market has viewed Britain's exit from the EU as negative on balance in the short term. Hence, the British pound has depreciated to its lowest level in 30 years and the Euro also affected to a lesser degree. Stock markets around the world have similarly gone downwards losing 2.1 trillion dollars in a day. Everybody, not just the British people, have been affected. At the end of the day, it's not economics but mainly politics that drove 51.8% of UK voters to vote for Leave.",Joseph Tan,0,2016-06-26 13:23:29

Like the writer who was shocked and dismayed, many people the world over were similarly flabbergasted one way or another, taking losses because of the historic depreciation of the British pound amidst the global financial meltdown of Britain's unwelcome exit from the EU.

1331060486923439_1332684373427717,"We need to draw lessons from Brexit. Living in a globalised environment today, immigration is one of the many issues that most developed countries faced. Folks from less developed countries wants to move to well-developed countries. That's human nature. Didn't we start as a migrants' society and developed into what it is today as a multi religion, multi races, with diverse opinions and live as one harmonious society? This will only continue when people and government work as one. People need to be engaged. How civil servants does its work is how people perceive the performance of the government? Private sector professionals need to sit on public boards and/or committees to provide insights into the industry that civil service may not be entitled to based on their experience and training. Broad brush approached across industries should be avoided as each are unique to itself. Bond and trust will be strengthen when public and private takes ownership and the humility to admit that we do not have the perfect answers to all problems and to work together towards solving the problem and give recognition when it is due. We cannot shut ourselves from the inter-connected world, we cannot change the world but we can change how we view the matter, embrace the situation and work towards a balance that is best perceived by our people and best for the nation. If our jobs are so easily taken away by foreigners that is perceived as due to lower wage than locals. Shouldn't we reflect if we are competitive in the first place? Are we still adding value to the work place or nation before we rant? Challenges of any government in the world includes managing perceptions of the people, the choice of whether to have the courage to present tough choices to make or present populist policies by politicians. We need to continuously work on a culture and values system that is strong enough to withstand economic downturn, social disharmony and keep us United. Only with strong values system, will we be able to be tolerant with each other. The best gift we can give to next generation is the strong values we dearly hold and believe. In every society, every poor man or rich man has a vote. Singapore, being a tiny island do not any risk appetite to fail. It takes one vote, one moment to decide the future.

1305845549444933_1309087249120763,"The owner of the existing deployed capital base (Hotel) bought the robotics (Bed-making robots) with additional capital based on the considered recommendations of the managers - who then dev systems to train the workers to be more productive with the robotic capital. These managers have risked their social & career capital with their recommendations.

What is the share of productivity gained from the use of the new robotics between owner, manager and worker? The evidence is that in recent years on average all the productivity gains in the service industry has gone to the owner or to the managers of capital. 

Does the Union have a role to reshape this share? Can the Union act as a risk manager of career and social capital to recommend to the manager of deployed capital - better organization, methods and tools to obtain and distribute a larger share of the productivity gains either by robbing the managers of capital or the owners of the existing deployed capital to the mutual benefit of all? It may not be a zero sum game.

If the worker used SkillsCredit to fund their own training in the new workflow - can they have a larger share of the gains in productivity?

If the Union provided POC financing for a team of Union workers who voted for initiatives to improve their job design hence accelerating organizational adoption - can the Union and workers obtain a larger share of the productivity gains from the deployed base of capital as a basis of tripartite action? It is the traditional role of Unions to provide strike financing - Why not Work Improvement financing in order to obtain a rightful share of productivity gains from new capital injected?

Can you prevent the managers of capital belonging to the Unions from creaming the gains instead of sharing it more broadly using a socialist union culture alone? Can we re-shape the current productivity re-distributive formula by enabling more mid level/start-up managers to act as managers of capital w/o a new social org chart?

What underlies the performance of managerial skill in capital allocation?",Fong Fattchee,0,2016-05-26 22:22:46

This world is non-dual perhaps in nature and to suggest that an ordinary being may attain moksha or nirvana going through cyclical existence without first being a deva is not possible. We salute all the Brahman faiths as well as devas and human beings, and we take pride in our intrinsic goodness that has been conducive in making the Republic of Singapore a living haven and a beautiful pureland.

1304936046202550_1305388382823983,"Sir, what is more interesting would be how this tree became revered and incorporated into the Buddhist and Hindu faith, since it is native to Central and tropical South America and only came to Sri Lanka in the 1880s. It is amazing how fast an idea can take root and become entrenched and its origin forgotten in the space of a hundred years. 

Another example is the chili. Ask any Indians and Southeast Asians what we were eating before we had chili, most would insist we always had been eating chili. But chili is yet another plant introduced from the New World.",Choy Heng-Wah,1,2016-05-21 19:51:21

Now the stroke attack on Mr Heng.

The are enough advances in the science of senescence (aging) that any meaningful physical exercise must be designed based on the 3 hypothesis:
1. Humans are created to move with the caveat ""use it or lose it"".
2. Humans are created to be on all fours, spreading evenly all the body weight on the 4 limbs.
3. No need to move vigorously, pant heavily and sweat profusely for health&fitness. Just maintain constant blood and Qi flows for oxygen and nutrients to reach all the body especially the brain. (More to come)",Norman Wee,1,2016-05-12 12:18:48

1263546813674807_1263713893658099,"""The pernicious spread of occupational licensing has stifled startups. Some 29% of professions, including hairstylists and most medical workers, require permits, up from 5% in the 1950s."" - The Economist, The Problem with Profits, Mar26th 2016. 

IMHO, the possibility that occupational licensing could stifle startup is NOT a problem. The larger problem is that it supports ossification of client segments,  methods & processes. It stops agility and places the innovative cadence on the track of a WSQ committee. Who makes up & controls these committees? - the incumbent service providers more so that the clients for these services.

It makes for a less conducive business environment and makes it harder to build an an ecosystem that works because the selective pressures are external to the dynamics of demand/supply signaling. It is the incumbent lobbyist and professional beauty contestant/insider who wins in such business environments. That is NOT the way you build  an exceptional SINGAPORE. That is a nightmare that Skills Future 2.0 can bring without a nuanced implementation. If we do not put sufficient thought into refreshing & raising the substance of occupational licensing continuously, the unintended outcomes can be vicious and stable.",Fong Fattchee,0,2016-03-27 14:44:46

""The craftsmen hand-building cars at the Ford Motor Company's Piquette Avenue assembly plant in the first decade of the 20th century were, among other things, impressively productive at their tasks. 

Two or three workers would gather around each partially-assembled car, taking parts, checking their fit, adjusting them on a metal lathe as needed, then checking the fit again, and so on. To watch them work would be to watch experts practiced in their movements and efficient in their tool use.

But as we now know, this productivity was irrelevant, as their approach to the work as a whole was sub-optimal.

By the second decade of the twentieth century, Henry Ford perfected his assembly line model and combined it with a commitment to producing interchangeable parts.

This new workflow was less natural, required significant capital investment, and introduced many new logistical headaches: but it also unleashed a level of value production that the old method of car construction could never match ‚Äî no matter how skilled or efficient its practitioners."" - Cal newport. 

Is there a solution, to make home ownership irrelevant to stability in home life for the middle class? Do they need to be driven into home ownership & asset appreciation prematurely & sub-optimally.

Should not the priority be to restore them to a contributory productive level and maintain a scaled efficient production & allocation of basic public housing.

1263546813674807_1267745289921626,"""New ERP system 'will offer flexibility in charging'"" in Today, 26th Feb 2016.

.

To justify spending S$556m, the main enhancement of the satellite ERP system must be in removing LTA's responsibility from fixing the ERP gantry charges by leaving it to the motorists to decide the charges and the level of congestion that they are prepared to live with and accept.

.

The satellite-tracking ERP real-time, interactive satellite-based system should allow for faster changes in ERP charges.

.

It should allow the motorists to decide among themselves the level of charges, and they should bear the consequences of gridlock traffic jams if they decide to manipulate the ERP charges far too low.

.

Surely, the system will self-adjust the charges as the top 30% high-usage drivers when affected by massive traffic jams would want to raise the charges for the following month to discourage the huge number of cars passing through that particular ERP gantry and time slot.

.

Also, LTA should use the system to incentivise and discourage motorists from using the CBD as a shortcut passage way to drive across the island during peak hours. This can be achieved by tracking the number of vehicles that take less than 15 minutes to cross the CBD from one end to the other.

.

However, many motorists are still not convinced that our COE and ERP systems are necessary in keeping our compact island of 713 sq km free of traffic gridlock situations. They must always remember that our CBD is in the southern edge and the reservoir catchment areas are in the middle of our tiny island of 5m people. All these fixed and unique features of our landscape affect the flow of traffic from one end of the island to the other.

.

Some Singaporeans even want the Govt to further control the vehicle population thus depriving many who are in need of owning a vehicle from owning one. We must not forget that vehicle ownership does not contribute to congestion, but overuse of vehicles does.

The ultimate aim in enhancing our traffic management is for MOT to end the dissatisfaction and scepticism in the public domain that the ERP system is inequitable, and that it is not for managing traffic flow but a revenue generating tool for the Govt. The new satellite system should make this happen.",Tan Kok Tim,0,2016-03-30 23:40:25

1263546813674807_1287122574650564,"It surprised me that MCI and you, Mr Tharman, used the word ""Federated"" to describe the locker system out of the blue. 20 years ago, when I first mooted, patented and launched the system in Pasir Ris New Town with SingPost on a wireless data network used by taxis called dataroam- Federation was my & Sun's catch word. The system would allow for self-describing devices to join the network, self-describe their services to a controller/user in the cloud and offer a myriad of services and features at various locations. Today, protocols like REST APIs are firmly established standards for systems to programmatically communicate.

Instead of a single provider offering one type of locker, the system would be able to continuously evolve with various new designs and business models joining, leaving and iterating. So it pains me to say this. The fundamental user facing function has hardly evolved since the core founding team left 15 years ago. The system was developed as a prototype of a larger ideal - something that could evolve and be ever future ready. I hope that it does not continue to exists as a single narrow niche device it has stayed for the last 15 years. The system was manifested as a prototype for a specific investor & then market entry strategy to establish a location at the void deck. My handlers & mentors were not keen on federation and did not see the notion as a positive contributor. I lost the argument fair & square. 

The hardware designer is now Dy Head of the COE ATM PO @ CAAS, the software lead is now running software ops based outside of Singapore, other Alumni are in strategy, telcos, venture funds, unicorns & ATCs.

1257759127586909_1262396723789816,"One of many cultural strengths of American society is the role pervasive grassroots sports play in supporting an understanding of a team-based competitive bent in that individualistic society. Take the American football meme of a ""3 day"" offensive install. That is American football lingo for a large team of players to drill and learn a complex new play to game day competency. The coach ""installs"" the play he invented into the team in 3 days as a Standard Operating Procedure. Practices are executed in 15min takt times and expected to be efficient with the parents watching.

Likewise, the Japanese have cultural practices to support large scale efficient cooperative norms. The ""andon cord"" culture germinated in Japan and was then transplanted into the world. Firstly, it took root outside of Japan at the much studied Californian GM plant in the mid-1980s, and then to the Canadians and beyond. Many practices of the lean movement can be traced to these cooperative norms. 

Likewise, we too can count many cultural strengths. 

Yet, when a stalwart institution like SMRT fails, it is good that we pause to reflect. It has been many days since SMRT started failing. Do we need to consider how to do better and level up to a higher performing culture faster? How do we get there and what cultural or institutional norms are not helping and which are helpful? Is our gold standard in change management sourced from our Armed Forces? Should we revive the military tradition of a policy of fast relief in field commands to strengthen selective pressures on our institutional blueprints?

Would a trainee survive or be praised for pulling the andon cord in the current SMRT culture?

Does it have the smell of a bureaucratic institutional blueprint? 

Should we continue to invest in our best military experts, take the casualties, par for the course as canon fodder and move forward and accept the cognitive blindness by leaky military metaphor?

Today, I hope, the tragedy can make the realization of new adjacent possibilities more possible.",Fong Fattchee,0,2016-03-26 13:34:57

I count the vagueness of objectives, the non-support of healthy, self organized  learning channels, the emphasis on credentialized monetized training. The lack of frank public evaluation of the WSQ program & ATO as a major plank of industrial transformation. 

Two examples are cited to warn about not grounding the SkillsFuture 2.0 concept in first principles of cultural change. 

In 1972, Gen Eli Zeira's ""concept"" & his firm hold on the Directorate of Miltary Intelligence cognitively blinded the Isreali Cabinet & Army General Staff . 

In the autumn of 1940, high-ranking German economists led by Gen Georg Thomas advised against an invasion of the Soviet Union stating that it would be an unbearable economic burden and the army logisticians further calculated a rate of advance would place Moscow beyond reach prior to a need for winter preparations. However, the ""concept"" not the grounded study of logistics held sway.

We all yearn for the good intentions for the concept for a mass Movement in skills cultivation - ""What if... the major planks already implemented are flawed and will never support these goals but instead prevent their achievement?

I am Cantonese. I remember my granny cook a very delicious ""Cai"" a vegetarian dish on Lunar New Year eve in the 50's. The dish is almost similar to Sir Shanmugaratnam description of the Nonya Chap Chye dish but Cantonese Cai add ""Nam Yue"" curds which give a distinct taste to Cai. I understand Cai was a vegetarian dish of Canton. After her passing my mother continue the tradition until she passed away in 2008. It was a dish that all my brothers, sister, nephews, nieces, relatives look forward to eat on New Year day when they visit us. I never learn to cook it during my mother's life time but did watch while I help her in her old age as she was weak and cannot stand up too long. I will cook Cai and other traditional dishes for my family gathering meals on New Year day from memories of my granny and mother cookings, but regrettably never been able yet to cooked the same due to the struggle with the little time I can spent with our elders to learn so much they have and not passed down.

Example - bankers, IT , Shipping etc, etc, The specific unions will understand what companies and workers require, rather than present system WDA, E 21 are run by general staff who are not sure of the skills requirements. Companies looking for workers must approach these specific unions for specific candidates and same time publish in Jobs Bank . The specific unions will liaise with the companies and sent their specific candidates for interviews. Such simple exercise will prove if companies concerned are seriously in search for Singapore Core workers or simply die die looking for foreign talent. MOM and NTUC and TAFEP will then have a case to discuss with the HR of the company concerned should they constantly reject unemployed qualified Singaporeans. There are companies in Singapore where the HR are foreigners which should not be and in country like Indonesia, foreigners are not allowed to take up HR posts for the simple reason, they will bring in only foreign talent. Is time for change and not make speech after speech with no simple corrective actions been done

Otherwise I would suggest let us withdraw our CPF to feed ourselves as we are Senior Citizens and is wrong of you to make us beg for a living and been treated like 2nd class citizens, while foreign talent enjoy the fruits of our hard labour. My first job was 50 cents an hour as apprentice in Sembawang Shipyard in the 70s.
Un-employed Singaporeans are getting hungrier day by day and the figure is growing and is about time we see real actions taken by MOM, NTUC and TAFEP.

1227234033972752_1236973232998832,"Mr Chan Chun Sing, Mr Lim Swee Say, Mr Patrick, Mr Teo S.L.  - Can NTUC assist unemployed PMET and all Singaporeans by having them registering their names at specific unions representing specific group of workers. Example - bankers, IT , Shipping etc, etc, The specific unions will understand what companies and workers require, rather than present system WDA, E 21 are run by general staff who are not sure of the skills requirements. Companies looking for workers must approach these specific unions for specific candidates and same time publish in Jobs Bank . The specific unions will liaise with the companies and sent their specific candidates for interviews. Such simple exercise will prove if companies concerned are seriously in search for Singapore Core workers or simply die die looking for foreign talent. MOM and NTUC and TAFEP will then have a case to discuss with the HR of the company concerned should they constantly reject unemployed qualified Singaporeans. There are companies in Singapore where the HR are foreigners which should not be and in country like Indonesia, foreigners are not allowed to take up HR posts for the simple reason, they will bring in only foreign talent. Is time for change and not make speech after speech with no simple corrective actions been done

Otherwise I would suggest let us withdraw our CPF to feed ourselves as we are Senior Citizens and is wrong of you to make us beg for a living and been treated like 2nd class citizens, while foreign talent enjoy the fruits of our hard labour. 
Un-employed Singaporeans are getting hungrier and angry day by day and the figure is growing and is about time we see real actions taken by MOM, NTUC and TAFEP.
To allow foreign talent to continue coming in without any accountability to the people must be stopped 
Is a simple exercise. NTUC gets income from membership fees. Unemployed Singaporeans get Jobs. Companies looking for staff just call up specific unions. MOM get their figures correct, how many Singaporeans are un-employed up to date and also assist to match them via Jobs bank. No need yak yak yak, speech after speech and act BLUR. .This is 2016 and not 1986, Sir. - Un-employed Senior Citizen Speaking - Just a Common Man In The Street.",NG Phillip,0,2016-02-22 04:44:01

I am a Singaporean, but feel like a foreigner - PG have package, students have Earn and Learn, handicaps have incentives, prodigal sons are given a chance to redeem themselves. PMET have skillsfuture credit of $500, which is not enough to cover my NICF-PMP course ... WDA said no award for this certificate (these are courses than help us get jobs).  The work age extension is killing those around our age ... bosses do not retire, cost cut with middle management first.

1205346709494818_1221844684511687,"Ê∂àË¥πÁ®éÊ∂àË¥πË∞Å? Milking skin and bones....

Ever wondered why might any govt. favor an unequal society under a progressive tax system? 
Imagine $1 billion equally distributed among a population of 1 billion/ day ($1 billion / 1 billion/ day) --> each gets $1/ day. Now tell me, what could you possibly tax? Take into consideration, the emotional burden too. You earn $10 each day - how much are you willing to donate to charity? Suppose you earn $1,000. :)

So, they've come up with a consumption tax (sales tax/ VAT) such as the GST in which the poorer you are, the higher the likelihood that you will be skinned. Why? As consumers, we all consume, especially basic necessities. Applying a standard tax rate indiscriminately across all consumer goods and services - Sounds fair enough? 

But, take a closer look at it: The poorer you are, the less you can afford luxury consumption as a higher proportion of your income is already spent on basic necessities, while for the rich with a higher spending power, they probably still have income to spare, even after splurging on luxury items. The result? The poorer you are, the higher the proportion of your income is taxed under the consumption tax system. :)

While one might argue that giving tax breaks to the rich - who are willing to take calculated investment risks having been market-tested - encourages economic growth, does that mean serfdom is best for the economy? :)

There is a psychological effect. Annual income tax filing can be a hassle. The jaw-dropping amount taxed reminds you of daylight robbery. The pain and anger are sudden and unbearable. With the consumption tax however, it is a ""boiling frog"" scenario for most consumers. :)

Under a progressive tax system in which the govt. and rich share the spoils, the global community is already embarrassingly unequal. The introduction of a regressive consumption tax, more suitable for a wealthy society with a relatively fair wealth distribution, serves only to further aggravate an already widening rich-poor gap. 

Held hostage to corporate greed, the rich have shrewdly exploited intense competition among countries for foreign capital and investment to pressure governments around the world to downgrade corporate and income taxation, increasing the burden on poorer consumers instead to compensate the rich. Isn't this a double-whammy, for the lower-income groups? Is this sustainable, with the rich being the only winners? :)    

This is the inequality trap in a downward spiral - As the rich get richer, they wield greater influence. And the greater their influence, the stronger their bargaining power in negotiating ever expanding unjust deals for themselves.",Yi Jiun,0,2016-01-30 03:23:38

Ever wondered why might any govt. favor an unequal society under a progressive tax system? 
Imagine $1 billion equally distributed among a population of 1 billion/ day ($1 billion / 1 billion/ day) --> each gets $1/ day. Now tell me, what could you possibly tax? Take into consideration, the emotional burden too. You earn $10 each day - how much are you willing to donate to charity? Suppose you earn $1,000. :)

So, they've come up with a consumption tax (sales tax/ VAT) such as the GST in which the poorer you are, the higher the likelihood that you will be skinned. Why? As consumers, we all consume, especially basic necessities. Applying a standard tax rate indiscriminately across all consumer goods and services - Sounds fair enough? 

But, take a closer look at it: The poorer you are, the less you can afford luxury consumption as a higher proportion of your income is already spent on basic necessities, while for the rich with a higher spending power, they probably still have income to spare, even after splurging on luxury items. The result? The poorer you are, the higher the proportion of your income is taxed under the consumption tax system. :)

While one might argue that giving tax breaks to the rich - who are willing to take calculated investment risks having been market-tested - encourages economic growth, does that mean serfdom is best for the economy? :)

There is a psychological effect. Annual income tax filing can be a hassle. The jaw-dropping amount taxed reminds you of daylight robbery. The pain and anger are sudden and unbearable. With the consumption tax however, it is a ""boiling frog"" scenario for most consumers. :)

Under a progressive tax system in which the govt. and rich share the spoils, the global community is already embarrassingly unequal. The introduction of a regressive consumption tax, more suitable for a wealthy society with a relatively fair wealth distribution, serves only to further aggravate an already widening rich-poor gap. 

Held hostage to corporate greed, the rich have shrewdly exploited intense competition among countries for foreign capital and investment to pressure governments around the world to downgrade corporate and income taxation, increasing the burden on poorer consumers instead to compensate the rich. Isn't this a double-whammy, for the lower-income groups? Is this sustainable, with the rich being the only winners? :)    

This is the inequality trap in a downward spiral - As the rich get richer, they wield greater influence. And the greater their influence, the stronger their bargaining power in negotiating ever expanding unjust deals for themselves.",Yi Jiun,0,2016-01-30 03:23:18

Singaporeans are generally a docile society that lives in fear but if any form of problems will be for sure from the foreign population moving into Singapore.

Worship involves a degree of submission that is a sense of obesience whereas veneration is respect. This was the unresolved problem chinese christians have with ""ancestor worship"". Its not worship as such it is ancestor respect. Words wield such wicked consequences.

1176387905724032_1186626148033541,"Hi Tharman, 

Just curious ...
By Judge See Kee Oon's standards
CHC Case - 6 years jail, 72 months of jail or 6*12*24=52560hrs hours of jail, ie $50,000,000/72 months = the exchange rate is 1 year of jail for $8,333,333 
Apply to Mobile Air Case -16599/50,000,000*52560=17.448 hours of jail = less than 1 day

By Judge Siva's standards
Mobile Air - 33 months of jail, ie 16599/33*12=the exchange rate 1yr of jail for $6036 
Apply to CHC Case - $50,000,000/$6036=8283 years of jail

Moral of the story, if you wana cheat, cheat big... There're economies of scale in cheating? Won't you wana cheat $50m and get 6yrs of Jail than cheat $16599 and get 33months, aka nearly 3 years?... Or make sure you get a lenient judge? Why are District Judge Siva Shanmugam and Judge See Kee Oon's standards so different? Maybe we should get the former to attend to the CHC case? More money involved $50m vs $16599, more people 30k paxs versus 26paxs, longer court case and more legal fees involved in former... Why isn't there some consistency in the ""exchange rates""? The discrepancy in the rates is appalling! Do we need the Chief Justice to sit on both cases to have greater consistency in the application laws and penalties? Can you get your Law ministry to explain the drastic discrepancies to laymen like us? Thanks.",Lee Soh Geok,0,2015-12-01 02:02:47

Please do continue to be humble and dont take this mandate for granted based on Straits Times article somebody commented ""voters can give you the mandate but they can take it back also"".

1145552878807535_1146062155423274,"Dear Mr Tharman , first of all , I would like to congratulate the PAP on the beautiful victory on 11 sep 2015. It was most of all, a win for Singaporeans for their discernment amidst tempting proposals from oppositions, and their trust in the PAP government that despite the more bitter pill the government had subscribed to, it is for the greater good of the country.  I am really heartened and glad.

Frankly, I have been a victim of government's leftist and immigration policies in the past 4.5 years. Despite the unhappiness , I try to accept that it is for the betterment of Singapore and I voted for PAP. However, I would like to urge the PAP government to not take such votes for granted and to continue to listen to the people and engage people of all levels. It cannot be all give for a certain segment of society. 

In particular, I would like to suggest that the PAP government should resume Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) to continuously engage the citizens in important areas of gridlocks like our foreign manpower and immigration policies, welfare and tax regimes etc.  
Finally, I hope Mr Tharman can consider to be the next PM.

1145552878807535_1148509048511918,"Dear Sir ,  Dear PAP and Everyone, Why the PAP won big this GE,
TODAY reports: The People's Action Party romped home comfortably in most contests this General Election, representing widespread endorsement of the party that has governed Singapore since 1959. How do we explain this significant, unexpected result? SINGAPORE: GE2015 demonstrated the adaptability of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) and the resilience of the one-party system in Singapore. With their ballots, Singa¬≠poreans have handed the PAP a strong mandate. The outcome was unexpected, as the party romped home comfortably in most contests. The swing back to the PAP was across the board, representing widespread endorsement of the party, which has governed Singapore since 1959. How do we explain this significant, unexpected result?

First, given regional insecurities and economic uncertainty, a ""flight to safety"" mindset galvanised voters ‚Äî especially a significant middle ground of undecided ones ‚Äî who opted for the tried-and-tested PAP as the best way to deal with the real threats and those over the horizon. Prior to Polling Day, there was a pervasive sense of foreboding that the PAP may see further and deep decline in electoral support. While a freak election result was not deemed to be at play, voters probably felt that a further loss of political support would be highly challenging for the PAP with regard to how it would govern in its next five-year term. Second, the PAP has been working hard since the previous election in May 2011. There were enough hot-button issues, such as cost of living, public transport inadequacies, healthcare affordability, retirement adequacy and immigration. In pulling out all the stops to address these issues, which had caused voters to turn away from it in the 2011 election, the PAP demonstrated that it could rise to the occasion even with its back against the wall. Once again, the PAP's track record of delivering on its promises provided a safe harbour for voters seeking a trusted and tested brand.

Third, the Workers' Party (WP)-run Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC), which became the meme of the PAP's campaigns, caused voters in the PAP-WP match-ups to consider closely whether the WP measured up in the task of running a town council. This titanic struggle was about driving home the grand narratives of what AHPETC ultimately represented. For the PAP, AHPETC was about the WP's competence, character and integrity, as well as the imperative of honest and responsible politics in Singapore. The WP portrayed the AHPETC issue as representing all that is wrong with one-party dominance as well as the supposed bullying that comes with the concentration of power and the lack of checks and balances in the system of governance.

It is clear that the AHPETC issue seriously undermined the WP's electoral fortunes. In the final analysis, the PAP's narrative on the AHPETC issue prevailed and resonated better with voters. This was demonstrated in the WP's loss of support across the board ‚Äî even in its Hougang stronghold and the Aljunied crown jewel ‚Äî and in the PAP wresting back Punggol East.

HOW SINGAPORE IS GOVERNED WILL MATTER

The election outcome can also be explained through how voters regarded the relationship between two variables: One, the largest number of elected Opposition Members of Parliament between 2011 and this year; and two, the PAP government's significant policy changes and how it had engaged the electorate since the previous General Election.

Given the significant electoral swing-back to the PAP, voters clearly did not see the relationship as a causal one, despite the WP's claim otherwise. Voters saw the relationship as a mere correlation, and assessed that the PAP's policy changes and innovations, such as the Pioneer Generation Package and MediShield Life, the several rounds of property cooling measures, as well as the efforts to deal with the public transport crunch, were largely driven by the PAP's efforts to get things right. Singaporeans have used their votes to duly reward the PAP's conscientious attempts to assuage their unhappiness on these hot-button issues.

Fourth, this poll appears to have conferred a strategic advantage on the PAP. In essence, Singaporeans were in a positive mood after the climax of the Golden Jubilee celebrations, fully savouring the celebration, pride, unity and reflection. The massive outpouring of emotion at the death of founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew appears to have given the PAP an ""LKY dividend"", made more poignant given that Mr Lee Kuan Yew's birthday anniversary is on Sept 16. While one should not overstate the effect of the combination of the SG50 celebrations and Mr Lee's passing, it should not surprise us that the PAP's campaign sought to reinforce in the minds of voters the PAP's and the late Mr Lee's critical role in the growth and development of Singapore.

Fifth, regional and economic insecurities also contributed to the national swing to the PAP. The haze from Indonesia, which peaked on Cooling-off Day, was a stark reminder of Singapore's vulnerabilities. These potential threats also helped the PAP garner support, given its strong record in national and internal security, as well as foreign relations.

Sixth, although the PAP did not carry out a campaign of particular note, the Opposition parties did themselves no favours by seeking to be even more to the left than the PAP. They assailed voters with grand schemes of more expenditures on various things such as free healthcare and unemployment benefits. Ultimately, voters carefully considered how sustainable and purposeful such plans were and were not taken in by the political false prophets.

GE2015 did not provide a firm indication as to whether Singapore is moving away from the one-party-dominant to a two-party or multi-party political system. This time, voters did not seem to place weight on the WP's intrinsic value as the leading Opposition party and its role in Singapore's evolving political landscape, where the idea of one-party dominance is increasingly being challenged. Despite high expectations, the WP was not able to consolidate and build on its gains of seven elected seats. The PAP stymied and even rolled back the WP's gains and ascendancy. As for the non-WP opposition, GE2015 demonstrates that it risks becoming irrelevant in a more competitive and demanding political landscape. Singaporeans are firm that there should not be opposition for opposition's sake.

While an aberration globally, Singapore's one-party-dominant system, which has been in place since 1959, remains dynamic and robust. With their ballots, Singaporean voters are signalling that the PAP Government must govern with empathy and less haughtiness, and not lose the common-man touch. It is not merely about whether Singapore is well governed, but how it is governed that will matter increasingly in the years ahead.

The PAP still has lots of soul-searching to do. It has to grapple with its own instinctive quest for dominance, and balance that with the electorate's growing belief that political competition, diversity and contestation are critical ingredients in a society at the crossroads.

The battle for the hearts and minds of Singaporeans is now concluded. Now, it is time for Singaporeans to put aside their political affiliations and work together for a better future.",Zhiwei Chan,0,2015-09-16 05:57:21

1145552878807535_1164955710200585,"I posted this to both MND and ReachSg's site.  Can you look into this because what HDB has done is to contradict your much earlier statements about the affordability of HDB flats.  In addition, how could HDB  just forfeit someone's deposit ($1,000) just like that?!!! How many times has it been done already, that the public does not know about?  Can you look into this, please. Here's what I posted -

Can someone look into this. This family from Pulau Ubin was rejected from a HDB flat because their $1,000 income is too low. Not only that, their $1,000 deposit for the flat was subsequently forfeited. Is this true? If so, here are more questions for HDB, MND, and the MPs (I believe one of them is DPM Thaman) who said that having a salary of $1,000 is enough to qualify for HDB flats and that HDB flats are therefore 'affordable' for them. My questions are:-
1. How can their deposit be forfeited just like that? How many people's deposits have been forfeited already? Where does such forfeited money go to?
2. EXACTLY HOW MUCH do you have to earn to be qualified for HDB flats? Please come up with a definite answer, once and for all.
3. Has the criteria changed since DPM Thaman made the statements that with $1,000 income, you can 'afford' a HDB flat? If so, then HDB should have informed the Minister, or did they forget? Why create discrepancies like that, in the public's eye? 

Here is a quote from the article:
""...As it is getting harder for them on the bumboat rides, the family tried applying for a HDB flat. After paying a deposit of $1,000, their application was rejected because the family income was too low, at $1,300. As a result, their hard earned savings that formed the deposit was forfeited.

Wasn't it not too long ago that a prominent Minister of Singapore said Singaporeans who earn $1,000 could afford a HDB flat? If that is so, why has HDB defied the Minister's logic and turned down the family's application? Is there coordination between what Ministers say and how Ministries act or was the Minister's calculation a dud?

Moreover, if HDB thinks the family is too poor to afford a flat, why further burden them by forfeiting their deposit? $1000 is a lot of money, you can afford a flat with this amount, you know?...""

1138026409560182_1140109216018568,"I want to appeal to you to stop and review the SGX's Share Consolidation for Companies with share prices below 20 cents. Companies are consolidating 5 shares to 1, some companies even reduce your 100 shares to 1 share. This enforced policy will affect more than 200 companies and thousand of shareholders like myself and does little to nothing to the effect of preventing share manipulation. In a short span of a few weeks, small investors have lost up to half their investment, hard earned money and lifetime savings. These investors are middle class common-folks who cannot afford to invest in blue chip shares. As a direct impact of the share consolidation, investors now steer clear of shares priced at close to 20 cents. It is impossible for us to cash out at this stage since there are no buyers in the market. Moreover, the consolidated shares while currently listed at higher prices continue to dip and common-folk investors will only lose their hard earned money endlessly. 

I implore you to consider the dire consequences of this policy and take action to stop this. Singapore is a free market and we should work hard to keep our stock exchange in lined with that and leave the market to decide the share prices for itself. I look forward to your reply and action.",Choo Bin Poh,0,2015-09-03 12:35:57

To invest and import this machine in will be quite costly but attaching the crawl on the back of existing refuse truck would serve HDB estate with centralized bin centre and attaching it to the side just like what one see in the video will serve the private estate well. However, in long haul it will save on manpower as the cleaning industry just like any are facing manpower crunch.

Of course, the latest system using suction had been built for trial in Yuhua ward but there might be some problem in the long term of rubbish stuck mid way down the pipe. I know of some new condominiums using the suction system but they are experiencing major problems like stuck refuse mid way and pipe not properly attached back after the suction truck leave the estate causing leaks. And this type of system can't take more when maximum capacity is reached as it does not compressed rubbish.

There are some very good leaders who cares and goes all out to be with the Singaporeans.Read the many storeis of Singaporeans who never get any replies form their MPs and even civil servants who claim they work with the people. If this is the way why keep harping on KAMPONG SPIRIT when in reality it is not there. Kindness and compassion. To be straight , the Honourable PM has called for civil servants  and ministers and mps to be compassionate and care for people.

Though the seat left empty,
Without Mr. LKY being seated,
Singaporeans are of certainty,
Prosperity has been seeded;

Though celebration is with him,
Absent from our naked sight,
We're always with him,
As gearing towards greater height;

We can feel the legacy,
Of a pragmatist leader,
With integrity and accountability,
As we're moving further;

The seat is empty unoccupied,
We're pretty sure of occupation,
With his spirit being inspired,
As we're pursuing his action;

An unoccupied seat,
In our occupation,
Sowing today a seed,
Yields tomorrow a fruition.

All of you have in your little ways have established my faith in members of parliament by your actions and work ethic and your care and commitment and compassion to helping Singaporeans.

All MPs have their respective roles clearly in their minds. If either of them tries to play games of superior status, the Singapore system will not work. We can construct the best system in the world, but if the people who occupy the top posts are not minded to make it work, it will not be a success.
Members of Parliament must always be aware that they are looked up to as role model and that all are fair game for an honest political debate; Singaporeans who voted for the MPs, expect that, But lately there has been some not to good stuff in the media about allegations of wrongdoing, dishonesty and the like. There must be very strict rules which govern that people have to have some evidence before they throw mud. In terms of personal accusations, Members should not make allegations against other Honorable MPs outside the house; that maligns the reputation of MPs and the House as a whole. This will reflect on many. Singaporeans who are hearing and reading such news will come to a conclusion that the whole team in the house is not for Singapore.My humble suggestion, have a live debate and have it telecast and let Singaporeans hear them before making any judgement on a person.It is sad when Ministers , MPs and NCMPs forget that they are there to help all Singaporeans. and not doing their acts to score points.

Today many are brought up by maids, grew up on fast food in a comfortable environment, hoping for a ""change"" by diluting the  Parliament with weak opposition. Our govt lost 5 ministers, plus 2 senior/mentor ministers since GE2011. And some opposition party who admitted they aren't ready to form a govt  are putting up even more candidates.

Apart from those ethnic groups you have mentioned, it's worth mentioning about the ambassadors who were responsible for the effective spread of Islam in our Nusantara region. Some dating way back. Some Muslim shrines and mosques in Indonesia dating back to 8th-9th century and even Muslim shrines here in SG dating back to the year 1100-1200 are part of the testimony.

These ambassadors were the best scholars of their time and were from regions like India, Samarkand, Morocco, Egypt just to name a few.

These are just some of the part of history not made available in our schools or to our generation.

The book, History of Java by Sir Stamford Raffles is one good reference for those who are not aware.

1104181412944682_1104809736215183,"That is different from Wikipedia 

""... South America remained the main source of the limited amounts of latex rubber used during much of the 19th century. The trade was well protected and exporting seeds from Brazil was said to be a capital offense, although there was no law against it. 

Nevertheless, in 1876, Henry Wickham smuggled 70,000 Par√° rubber tree seeds from Brazil and delivered them to Kew Gardens, England. 

Only 2,400 of these germinated after which the seedlings were then sent to India, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Indonesia, Singapore, and British Malaya. 

Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber. 

In the early 1900s, the Congo Free State in Africa was also a significant source of natural rubber latex, mostly gathered by forced labor. Liberia and Nigeria also started production of rubber.

In India, commercial cultivation of natural rubber was introduced by the British planters, although the experimental efforts to grow rubber on a commercial scale in India were initiated as early as 1873 at the Botanical Gardens, Calcutta. The first commercial Hevea plantations in India were established at Thattekadu in Kerala in 1902.

In Singapore and Malaya, commercial production of rubber was heavily promoted by Sir Henry Nicholas Ridley, who served as the first Scientific Director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens from 1888 to 1911. He distributed rubber seeds to many planters and developed the first technique for tapping trees for latex without causing serious harm to the tree.[5] Because of his very fervent promotion of this crop, he is popularly remembered by the nickname ""Mad Ridley"".[6]

This is really sad. Many have written on this issue and the government must take heed . If this call for family time is ignored or shaken up with some cherry cola Singaporeans will not be amused by it. Work, yes Singaporeans do that. So much has been blown by the wind. It is time for the government to acknowledge that family time is very important to family.. Family time for all will make a productive workforce. Pushing Singaporeans will have negative vibes. When conducting forums open it to all and have a live telecast and all will be heard lo and clear. Please don't do it selectively, Singaporeans the young and old has come to know what is really happening and putting barriers and have surveys with sweeteners will not hold them back. This is my personal view after reading comments from various sites. The bread and butter issue is so hot, unemployment, cost of living and the high cost of living and the report in the media that basic food on the table is hard to come by.

1074346029261554_1084306098265547,"I like DPM Tharman's eloquent ways of addressing Mr Stephen Sackur's questions. First, the DPM spoke on ethnic and social balance. The ethnic quota for housing flats, which was mooted by Dr Dhanabalan (I believe I remember correctly) and implemented some years ago serves to maintain the ethnic balance in housing precincts and neighbourhoods. Should this ethnic balance be upset, leading to the dominance of an ethnic enclave over the others in a certain housing neighbourhood, property prices would be affected in an undesirable way. Second, as our society evolves, we aim to achieve liberty - liberty in achieving our aspirations without being discriminated against because of our social backgrounds and other reasons; liberty to walk the streets freely and safely at night or at any time of the day (especially for women and children); liberty to express our viewpoints without the fear of suffering a backlash or being slapped, etc. We are a parliamentary democracy, but not in the British or American sense of the words. We don't have, and I suppose the Government does not condone, mass street protests, but we do have the Speaker's Corner and the Hong Lim Park in which political activists can voice their views and LGBT advocates can gather to light candles in support of their cause. The liberty that is allowed in our model of parliamentary democracy is not an unqualified one. People can exercise their liberty or freedom of speech within a certain defined boundary. Meaning so long as they do not infringe into others' sphere of privacy or hurt religious and racial feelings, or incite racial and religious resentments and cause social disharmony. In the past, magazines like ""The Wall Street Journal"" and ""The Economist"" had their publications temporarily suspended and their circulations cut down because of their articles and editorials which either slanted against the Government or threw untrue lights on our political system or economic management and policies. Authors like Catherine Lim who were given to literary excesses and who caricature the political leaders in unfavourable and satirical lights were rather harshly treated. But I reckon we have come a long way. The revolutions and development in social media means that it is no longer possible to curb or clip expressions of views in the same manners as were in the past. Anyone who contravenes the Sedition Act can be brought to justice or his/her knees. Singapore is a very small country, a dot in the ocean. A sesame seed. We have been able to forge a collective will, I think, in part also thanks to our spatial constraints. In other words, I think that precisely because we were small, or geographically limited, the Government's task of uniting the people of diverse ethnic and racial groups and backgrounds has been made light and easier. It is easier to forge a collective will within a smaller island country like Singapore than it is so for a geographically sparse and gigantic nation like America or England. As our pace of development gathers, we the Singaporeans will have to harness on our collective will and make it work to our advantage. Yes, no one owes us a living. Neither do we owe others anything at this point in time. The challenges ahead on our journey towards another more mature level of democracy are formidable. We don't have drastic debacles like the Authority crashing down on democracy advocates and supporters, like the infamous Tiananmen Square incident in 1989 in China. As the electorate becomes more sophisticated and discerning, a result of their high level of education, governance is no longer a task like building a tower or skyscraper. National leaders and policy makers will need to confront the reality of complexity in demands, differences in views and political preferences, resolving conflicts in opinions and forging a consensus. Our efforts in these, as in National Conversations, for example, are indicative of the steps that we have made forward, the milestones that we have achieved in our tenacious march towards a better and more ideal democratic system.",Lim Li Li,4,2015-06-08 01:05:58

One good way to improve on the nature is the gradual replacement of the vegetation with native species. Native vegetation are important because they provide the correct foods and living spaces for native animals. And, in the correct balance, neither leading to under-population or over-population of any particular species. Over-population of any particular species often result in them depleting the carrying capacity of their natural habitats, which then forces them to venture out to look for new living spaces.

Most vocational skills have such short shelf life that by the time it passes the politics of tripartism committee and makes it pass identification and codification... it is mostly irrelevant and the next skillset with premium pay is trending. The actual vocational skill is incidental and by-product to the meta-skills of skill acquisition and  continuous process improvement (aka lean/kaizen mindset). Does the current policy framework address the physics of skills lifescycle? IMHO, only for narrow low value-add segments. Can SkillsFuture move the needle? It is good to have more training, every advance country does it and yet I do not think the current institutions can do enough to be decisive. They will fail.

Be it Calculus, the physics behind flight or the beauty of Shakespeare, students these days can learn on online platforms everything that they need to know. Therefore, the roles of educators, are correctly, those of mentors. Guiding the children to the place where they can find information on their own, and helping them make sense out of it.

I guess I am the unlucky few: I was forced to learn English using the carrot and stick approach which did not work; not allowed to take Add Maths in secondary school that caused so much problems as I was made to study Engrg later in Uni; and later on in Uni when it was the time that Physics and Calculus was introduced to me, the learning environment was not conducive. I guess sadly to speak, I did not enjoy the style of teaching and did not gain much out of it. Not being able to get a Honours was regrettable, I did realised it was not entirely my fault as the system did expect people to have certain pre-requisite i.e. entering Engrg course in Uni.",Pang Soon Tan,2,2015-04-05 11:29:14

To push them further or make sure they're not falling behind. ( If you don't belong to either, one good way to get some of the teacher's time is to come up with creative mistakes.) 

I mentioned this to a teacher who acknowledged that there's perhaps some truth in what I observed but who also went on to give me what I think is the best advice ever. That if something's worth learning, you should keep at it regardless of how little attention the teacher's giving you.

Is it very hard to have Family Day Public Holiday. I hope more of our MPs and Ministers and our PM Mr. Lee will make this happen. Parents need to be with their kids and husbands and wives need each other so much. The heavy work schedule  and working late hours in Singapore has made many couples to have discreet  sexual affairs.. Next thing divorce and kids suffer. We need a strong family nucleus. Kids being molested, running away from home, radicalized , getting into drugs and gangster ism. Why is this happening"". Both parents are forced to work to pay for the high cost of living, housing, education, healthcare and the plain food on the table. It is sad and it breaks many hearts that Singaporeans has to work long hours, through weekends, get crushed in the public transport and with their blood, sweat and tears must pay for all that is wanted by the government. Please have compassion and help families to live a simple life with happiness. God bless the government and all the ministers and MPs that they will look deep  and win the hearts and minds of Singaporeans.. I pray that all the government agencies will have kindness, sincerity and most of all LOVE to help all in their difficulties ans in whatever situation they are in. I am not for luxury and for easy come easy go. I hope the government will make Family day an official holiday. Once again God bless you and family and all Singaporeans.",Bert Fern,0,2015-05-29 12:57:45

Without you and your pioneer team stepping up, taking on all hardships despite of how volatile the political situations were in the past, and hanging in there while we were being belittled by some close to home country's leaders back then, you and your team proved them wrong and united Singaporean as one, regardless of race, transforming Singapore from a third world nation to the first world nation today. We Singaporeans can never repay you for what you have done, you are awesome and really impressive!
It's really upsetting that you couldn't make it to celebrate SG50 with us even though you are the main reason behind the rising of modern Singapore, a tiny little red dot island. You have done your best to give Singapore the vision back then to lead us to where we are today, let the next generation do our job and hopefully Singaporeans will not make wrongful shortsighted decisions that could possibly undermine what you had sacrificed to build in your lifetime. 
You have done a lot of great things for Singapore and even the world leaders are amazed with Singapore's accomplishments within such a short time and it's all because of you. You are and will always be the legendary founding father of modern Singapore for as long as we exist.

What is the Price of The Whole of Singapore today [lock-stock-and-barrel price for all that we have on this rock, including goodwill and international connections and prestige] if Singapore is put up for sale on willing buyer and seller basis?

Now after the passing of our former PM the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, what truly has he left for us to continue?

On this SG50 should we not take stock, and aim to set a target Sale Price for 2065?

Will there be a competent valuer fit for the task?  Anyone in BT able to get the connections to have this appraised and let us have the numbers by 9 Aug?

Will Budget 2015 increase our cost of living?  

Budget 2015 has been hailed as progressive and inclusive as it aims to build our future and strengthen our social security. However, questions were also raised on: a) whether such budgets could be sustained, b) how they would be funded, and c) the risk of creating a crutched mentality.

The above are popular, politically correct questions. Perhaps, we should ask a more basic rhetorical question - Will Budget 2015 increase our cost of living? Actually, it already did immediately with the hike in petrol duty and added on cost by oil companies who took the cue from the Government. It is simplistic to say that the increase only affects motorists per se.

Through years of insidious public propaganda, ordinary citizens have been drilled to believe that Government subsidies, rebates, vouchers or grants, etc to help the poor will create a heavy financial burdens on tax payers and cannot be sustained in the long run, unless more and higher taxes are imposed. This is more apparent than real. The spectre of tax burden is not due to Government hand-outs by any measure. 

The costs of services and goods are always decided and inflated by the rich and powerful, but the burden of paying falls on everyone, and which are especially painful for the poor and powerless. In simple parlance, the rich become richer while the poor become poorer. Most of our current taxes have very broad-based multiplier effects, which burden the livelihood of ordinary citizens more than the rich. The financial woes of ordinary citizens are more due to the hyper inflated cost of living, and not their lack of efforts to earn enough to make ends meet. In fact, this has created a generation of new poor even among the middle or sandwiched class who were once considered well off and did not need Government hand-outs, but are now clamouring for more Government helps.

A good Government must be able to grow our national resources and reduce the tax burden on ordinary citizens. We do not need a government that keeps inflating costs of public goods and services, then hands out ""generous"" subsidies, rebates, vouchers or grants, seemingly to help, but in the next breath, insists that higher taxes are required to fund such social expenses. Such policies will only create the spectre of tax burden in a vicious cycle.   

DPM, in your post Budget 2015 TV forum, you called on all Singaporeans to come together and share the collective responsibilities in building a more progressive and inclusive society. Yes, your clarion call is irrefutable. However, if we really want to cultivate collective responsibilities and build such a society, elected leaders must start leading by example. They have the moral duty to lead, more so now than before, given that they are richly rewarded to do so. Simply advocating such an ideal is not enough.

1024059470956877_1027870630575761,"Hello Tharman Shanmugaratnam,  Thanks very much for the skills future study award scheme. While the program seek to encourage greater take up of investments in technology and computer science, there are currently limited options for graduates to go back to school unless to enroll in a  full time 4 year degree course.  In the UK and US, there typically are masters courses in the field of computer science for students who do not have bachelor degrees in Computer Science. One example is that of Imperial in the UK. Most of the foreign universities also allow for students to enroll in individual classes in their universities as an open student?   However, It would appear that the only way students can take up a computer science course at a local University would be to take up a 4 year degree course at NUS/SUTD. Please will you consider either introducing a masters at our local Universities or allow students to sign up for individual classes as a open student at these Universities? They will make it a lot easier for people to pursue life long learning.  We need more flexibility in providing access to our university education.",Huiying Chan,0,2015-03-02 14:08:47

Teach them to stand in the shoes of others through role plays or simple games to realize that it's normal to be different. Teach them how the courage to love others as others will love them. Sadly, the educational system around the world having not spent much time teaching these soft skills because they are hard to measure and allocate marks to. Parents are working and too busy to teach traditional values. Grandparents in Singapore could not transfer these long standing values to grandchildren because kids don't speak dialects anymore.

937030669659758_937089812987177,"Mr Shanmugaratnam. I was at De Anza's sister college - Foothill College, back in 1996, and the practice of lifelong learning has been has been promoted and embraced for a very long time. The oldest student during my time there was in his late 80s if I remember correctly. 

Cost of education is always a hot topic among Americans, and learning institutions have been trying their hardest to maintain affordability for their permanent residents. Back in 1996 when Foothill college was attempting to build up its popularity, Americans who lived in California were paying USD9 per unit, making a standard 3 unit course of study USD27 in total - healthcare and other administrative fees were minimal at worst, and they amount to about USD50 these days. 

Fast forward about 20 years down the road, Foothill College has grown in leaps and bounds, and current course fees for local residents have increased to USD31 per unit, no doubt due to rising costs and popularity of the school.

I believe that in order to promote lifelong learning, we need to create programs that are separate from the standard fare dished out at ITEs and the like, make these courses affordable for those who are in pursuit of knowledge beyond the workplace, and ensure that they run for a limited time. 

I personally believe that life isn't all about getting certified for a certain skill, and I hope Singaporeans will take a similar approach given time.

I too was considering making a switch to another industry, but the part-time course in Automotive Engineering would've taken me about 3 years to complete, together with thousands of dollars in tuition fees annually. 

It is unfortunate that I do not have the time, energy or financial capability to pursue such an endeavor, because I have commitments to my growing family.",Amos Leong,4,2014-10-13 02:55:30

I don't have a conventional job, by Singapore standards. It very much started when I was in secondary school and I was already pondering hard in what I want to do for the rest of my life. That sets my mind in a certain direction.

937030669659758_937456232950535,"Community Colleges are not just for lifelong learning. It's a much cheaper route to completing a degree. See this article by Dr Jill Biden (wife of US Vice President) who had been teaching in community colleges for many years: http://www.forbes.com/2009/08/02/community-college-professor-higher-education-opinions-colleges-09-jill-biden.html 

Many top students in the US double enroll in community colleges in high school and enter college as a junior, taking 2 years to complete their bachelor degree. This is an example of a girl who did so and completed her medical degree (which is a graduate degree in the US) at age 21. At 23, she is a qualified Paediatrician  and she's married too). http://www.wesleyancollege.edu/profiles/courtneymitchell.cfm

Singapore used to have a community college (Broward College) run by CAE, which is accredited by the US regional accrediting agency. Students from the program had been able to transfer all their credits to accredited universities in the US, including the Ivies (eg Columbia U). Unfortunately, I understand that this program is no longer available. It's worthwhile looking at offering associate degrees in place of A levels in our JCs. The courses are more diverse and give the students a better idea as to what they want to do in universities, while allowing for substantial depth in the areas of their intended majors. About time we re-look at our present system of having students compete for entry into some of the more popular courses in universities (like law, business and accounting) based on their A levels results in subjects like maths, science and humanities, which are of little relevance to such courses.",Charis Mun,0,2014-10-13 16:14:18

937030669659758_938129969549828,"Peter Drucker is one of my favourite authors. And according to management guru Charles Handy, Drucker was '""probably the wisest of all"".

Anyway, Drucker had high praises for the community colleges in America. Facebook was not founded in a community college. But I read somewhere that Mark Zuckerberg actually read Drucker to learn how to run Facebook. 

You know, if you read till the last part of the passage, when Drucker talks about why some ""emerging countries(Singapore included?)"" would still be decades behind America, I begin to understand why Charles Handy calls Peter Drucker ""wise"". 

**************************************************

(from Management Challenges for the 21st Century by Peter Drucker)

.....The United States is the only country that has actually developed this advantage‚Äîthrough its so far unique nationwide systems of community colleges. The community college was actually designed (beginning in the 1920s) to educate technologists who have both the needed theoretical knowledge and the manual skill. 

On this, I am convinced, rests both the still huge productivity advantage of the American economy and the‚Äîso far unique‚ÄîAmerican ability to create, almost overnight, new and different industries. Nothing quite like the American community college exists anywhere else so far. The famous Japanese school system produces either people prepared only for manual work or people prepared only for knowledge work. Only in the year 2003 is the first Japanese institution devoted to training technologists supposed to get started. Even more famous is the German apprenticeship system. Started in the 1830s, it was one of the main factors in Germany's becoming the world's leading manufacturer. But it focused‚Äîand still focuses‚Äîprimarily on manual skills and slights theoretical knowledge. It is thus in danger of becoming rapidly obsolete. But these other developed countries should be expected to catch up with the United States fairly fast. 

Other countries‚Äî""emerging ones"" or ""Third World"" ones‚Äîare, however, likely to be decades behind‚Äîin part because educating technologists is expensive, in part because in these countries PEOPLE OF KNOWLEDGE STILL LOOK DOWN WITH DISDAIN, IF NOT CONTEMPT, ON WORKING WITH ONE'S HANDS. ""THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE SERVANTS FOR,"" IS STILL THEIR PREVAILING ATTITUDE.

937030669659758_938246326204859,"American culture and history is all about change. 
The first thing we should ask ourselves is that are we efficient or being effective? EFFICIENCY is doing things right, EFFECTIVENESS is doing the right things. Just like there is a difference in between MANAGER and LEADERS.
I think we should understand the environment there, and the environment here are two very different equations with different dynamics and attributes.
There is a vast difference in their policy making and ours.
There is a vast difference in the mind set in terms of retirement, wages, benefits, HR policies and the list goes on and on..
There is a vast difference in cultural attributes for learning.
There are many difference our Country Singapore and the US.
And as most business strategically change from time to time they have done it from within.
And change occurs from a solid state to a liquid state and than solid again.
We dont change that way in our environment. We keep on multiplying, That is from a hard state we pour in softness that hardens and multiplies in size. Thus the size changes BUT the solid stuff is not soft to make the changes that is required.
Like I have stated at the beginning American culture and history is all about change, our culture is all about enhancement. In fact its not just our culture, that is facing the problem to change effectively, its the same problem that the whole of Europe even in Britain and Asia face. 
So the question is not if our people can change, the question should be, can our engine and machinery be change instead of having them enhanced or upgraded?
You need to change every part of the process not just the peoples mind set, but also the mind set of the business people, the government policies may it be HR or the benefits or even the recruitment and other things, instead of enhancement which is just tweaking the process bit by bit instead of a whole change?

I read it with much sadness filled with feeling of no national pride and shame that many people left behind rubbish for the cleaners at the floating platform after last Saturday's National Day Parade.    It is like having a perennial problem that we have no solution.  

In the book Hard Truths on the third page after page 354, there is the photo of :

""Lee hoses down Cheng Cheok Street as part of a week-long campaign in Nov 1959 to spring clean Singapore"".

Many of us have forgotten Spring Cleaning Singapore.   Now with many foreigners in our midst, they do not know our concern why it is important to have a hygienic tiny and compact island state.  

The margin of error for healthy living condition is small for us.  Unlike a huge country, when an epidemic hits, we will not have much space to escape from it.

Do we need a week-long Spring Cleaning Singapore like in the 50s?   Rather, we need only an annual National CleanUp Day.

I hope the Govt will declare a NCD to remind all about how we started back in 1959 to clean up Singapore.  It will be a living legacy of MM Lee's foresight to have a clean and green nation.

It is to help all of us remember the momentous history and how we get out out of the ghetto to become what we are today. 

It is folly for us to take things for granted.  It is not given.

Next year, the 50th year of independence, is the right timing for us to have the NCD.

The NCD will not be like any other  anti-littering campaigns, which have proven to be less effective.

871521576210668_871958649500294,"Yo TS.. This World Cup seems to be the most exciting World Cup tournament in recent memory, but I also lost a lot of money too.

While people in other countries are able to watch all, if not most, part of the tournament on free-to-air television in the comfort of their home, ordinary Singaporeans without pay TV, like myself, have to make their way to their community centres and McDonalds restaurants in the wee hours to view the TV broadcast. All this no thanks to SingTel winning the broadcast rights and charging an exorbitant subscription price for the event.

In many countries, major  sporting events, e.g. the World Cup and the Olympics, are required to be televised on free-to-air TV because they are considered events of public interest. For instance, pay-TV operators in UK are prevented from acquiring exclusive TV rights for such sporting events under the Ofcom regulations.

Will the PAP government consider such regulations so that ordinary people like me can enjoy simple pleasures in life without having to be held hostage by a government-owned monopoly? I can only count 5 to 10 more World Cup tournaments that I can watch before I report to Yama. :(

Finally, can I know why Taman Jurong CC is not showing?",Edmund Khor,1,2014-06-29 06:40:05
871521576210668_871983962831096,"Edmund: Taman Jurong CC is showing from the last 16 matches. I went past a few blocks yesterday and saw the signs showing that it is screening the matches from last 16. 

I think all pay tv operators have to manage their own cost to screen the movies. I am not sure if Singtel or Starhub could co-bid to reduce the cost but I believe it is quite challenging to do so. Our viewership is probably maximum of 2-3 million people watching it. other countries would have much higher subscription rates. 

Of course, we can always argue that there are free to air. other countries would have their provocative to decide on their situation.

798092003553626_112904550,"Hi DPM, the nursing role has evolved tremendously since the 1970s. Nursing entry in my seniors time, required interviews to allow assessment of that individual's ability to be a nurse. Nursing entry in my time(1990s), requires academic results, that do not need to be overly awesome. This has made nursing, a perceived 'easy' entry for all whole could not make it for the other courses. I belong to those who could not make it to the other courses. But I've since gotten my degree, and made my nursing my career, and my passion.

While it was easy to get into the course, passing the practical tests, going though the hospital attachments, handling patient lives, was no easy feat. This profession, is not for the faint hearted. 

I feel that efforts to improve nursing as a career, can be made better with allowing selected secondary school students to have a short stint in hospital, to observe how staff nurses perform in their jobs. This may be more effective than playing the current advertisements, which has limitations to truly show the public, our nurses. Individuals, whom finally decide to take up nursing, will not suffer reality shocks. 

I will like to also suggest that the nation recognises the passionate public nurses/healthcare professions regularly, by introducing nursing/healthcare awards (twice a year-currently once, and not well covered by media), and share with the public their contributions/sacrifices they have made to healthcare. Recognition, may help improve satisfaction level, and in turn, keep them in service. Agree with Dr Jeremy Lim, attrition rate is an area that needs to be addressed, as we need experienced nurses in the workforce to guide the juniors.",Audrey Kon,2,2014-03-01 07:59:10

Having said this, I guess the education system has to evolve especially in today's world, with the intention of having a 40% cohort - university participation rate as I do understand and can feel that it's not easy for the children to move up since the parents can't help the children much as they move the education ladder. 

It's only in this uni course of study that I first learnt Physics, Calculus [more in details], Matrix, writing a report, conducting presentation, Econs as an elective [yes I've purchased the textbook for it and has kept it since on top of all the other textbook and with no intention of selling it away]. 

To think of it, learning how to speak up and be quick to find a respond to any discussion or even pre-empt it. I still remember having to find a solution when my professor [who happens to be sitting in the MRT COI] of giving an example of not learning mistakes of others... 

Poly days was more on technical knowledge on fields such as electrical, automation and materials [terms like fatigue and material failures]. 

I can't ask my dad for help over uni matters since he only had O level education, though I'm grateful that he's able to cover for my uni tutition fee and the related daily expenses in cash after all the years of working in my grandfather's provision shop and now trading shares.

793812543981572_112890114,"I don't think by increasing Medisave contribution and insurance coverage alone solve the problem of health care costs. To some extent, health insurance encourages over-consumption and rising health care costs. There is a need to address the issue of rising health care costs, not all of which are due to advancement in medical care and technology. Don't you think there should be some scrutiny on hospital charges when it amounts to $4.54 for a safety pin cost and $4.51 for an 8 oz foam cup, both before GST? That's easily more than 40 times what the item would cost. 
Let me provide 2 more examples: 1) A pack of gauze (individually wrapped) sells for $3 for a pack of 10 including GST at the pharmacy while the hospital charges $5.12 before GST for a pack of 6 (not individually wrapped). That's more than 3 times the price elsewhere. 2) An impatient is charged $10.60 a tablet for an antibiotic like Augmentin compared to $2.20 at a private specialist clinic, both unsubsidized and before GST. The difference is close to 5 times, though the hospital is likely going to have greater economy of scale compared to a private specialist clinic.
While hospitals are entitled to make a reasonable profit, the amount of mark-up is ridiculous and I would say unconscionable, bearing in mind that in healthcare, it's not exactly a free market as the patient do not have the option of buying those items elsewhere. If we allow such costs to be charged because it's covered by insurance, insurance premiums will rise astronomically in the years to come due to the claim experience. The often given excuse for the escalating health care costs is technological advancements, but I don't think that present the full picture. I've provided several examples which could partially explain why health care cost is so high. This is just the tip of the iceberg ‚Äì most of the time, the consumers are not in a position to know if they are overcharged or even if items charged had indeed been consumed by them. Such costs can and should be controlled to prevent unsustainable rise in health care costs and insurance premiums.",Charis Mun,0,2014-02-22 15:17:15
793812543981572_112891350,"There should be a budget set aside to encourage youngsters to start their own business when they are in the early 20s. In the 60s to 70s, older generation took up entrepreneurship when they were young, with little education. Their organisation grew big when they were at their early 30s. Now, education takes up some time (e.g. 10 - 15 years) and most youngsters with full education (e.g  diploma or degree) only start their own business venture in their mid 30s with little saving. Some succeeded and some failed in their 30s. For those who succeed, their business only grow when they are 40s to 50s, which will not help Singapore economy to be vibrant in the short term. It does not allow them to be successful at the early age, which indirectly discourage them to have family and to have children early. Youngsters only start having family and children when their career stabilise. We should have more SME rather than MNC established in SG to keep our economy stable. In downturn, SME stays as SG is their home. MNC scale down and venture somewhere until it gets better again. Employment rate will be affected if we are too dependent on MNC.",Wentian Lian,0,2014-02-23 02:38:55

And he said:
Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you,
And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.
You may give them your love but not your thoughts.
For they have their own thoughts.
You may house their bodies but not their souls,
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;
For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.",Khaja Nazimuddeen,1,2013-09-03 13:51:17

However, what is alarming and unacceptable is the simultaneous rise in anti-Singaporean sentiment and behaviour among large numbers of foreigners in Singapore. It is perceived, especially online, that we are on our own and having to fend off discrimination without the help of the powers to be. A very recent viral video of a PRC man shouting death threats to a Singaporean in the MRT has not elicited any response from the police or any authority. Social tension is rising and our decades of nation-building is unravelling right us. ",David Ching,0,2013-09-14 16:09:03
690863507609810_112515622,"Before we reach the critical point, can I suggest the following measures to reduce the dangerously high foreign population with negligible effect on the foreign workforce. 1. A 5-year breather in new PRs/Citizens with the exception for those who have completed NS, offsprings of S'pore citizens overseas and 'strategic' individuals. First proposed by your PAP colleague, MP Inderjit Singh, this step will prevent their spouses, children, parents, parents-in-law and grandparents from settling here. It also gives us some much-needed time to at least partially integrate our new residents. 2. Suspend the dependent passes privileges of existing S-pass and E-pass holders. A concession can be granted to EP P1 holders who can continue to sponsor their spouse and children so as to sustain the international schools. 3. Suspend the long term passes for the controversial study mamas and student passes for private schools. 4. Reduce the unpopular scholarship cum living allowance for foreign students. This policy has the damaging effect on our students, who feel discriminated like 'non-bumiputras' versus the foreign students 'bumiputras'. Official development aid to Third World countries can be in the form of vocational training or infrastructual development in their home countries. These scholarships have caused unnecessary hurt and envy to our own.",David Ching,0,2013-09-14 16:33:40

I sincerely hope you can be different this time. I have come to the realisation that regime change is unlikely in 2016 due to the advantages of the incumbency. Thus, I'm here as a local born and bred citizen seeking your help to avert a looming crisis in the only home I know. You see, I do not possess much wealth or talent to emigrate.

Once we do that, we get an unwanted reputation that will stick for a long time and hurt us internationally. We should stay with calibrated steps than adopt extreme approaches.

Coins are not legal tender to begin with for usage on bigger monetary transaction, so definitely people would want to find ways to reduce the amt of coins they keep.

Furthermore the banks seriously as I'll crudely put it, have sense of social responsibility over these matters.. They're only thinking of how to increase their ultra high profit level. I did saw the circular they sent to customers... They are now literally extorting people even with Legal tender transaction... $50 surcharge when the notes are not categorised during the transaction.

682546258441535_115300987,"To those urging for a reply w.r.t that article dated in 2011. I have one thing to say, its called: real-time governance. Our policy makers have the task of constantly gathering data around zones of economic need and social tension before they implement policies to empower our society. As such, there is an inherent need to make changes to policies as and when needed. 

For the ignorant: Singapore is a microcosm of the world's economy. Whatever that happens around the world affects us. Especially so when most of our revenue comes 'flowing in' . There is a need for us to be self-sufficient and at this point with so many calls for better healthcare and housing it is expected that our gov's expenditure may exceed its total revenue and there is till a certain time before our reserves run dry. Therefore, the self-sufficiency effort will have to be sustained by our people. 

Plus with the declining birth rates and an increasing aging population (who are usually not contributing to the tax revenue) - its only common sense that whoever is paying tax will have to absorb higher costs. From what I have read in the past 16 people absorbed the cost of taking care of 1 elderly, now its 4/5 is to 1 elderly and if its status quo it may become 2 tax-paying individuals to 1 elderly (numbers may not be accurate) - but the idea is we are and we will be seeing an inversion in the numbers...

Would you rather have increased individual income tax? Or perhaps 'force' the elderly to 'work till death' so they will be self-sufficient (that way the rest of us don't have need to pay for them)?",Elizabeth Mystic,3,2013-08-25 13:06:40

Singapore is a multi-racial country founded by pioneer group led by LKY and his past generational of leaders. Let's give credits where it is due. I remembered watching televised parliamentary speeches in the past. It wasn't easy to decide what to co-opt what aspects to add in and what to be left out. It can make a nation or breaks a nation. I'm thankful for what they had done for the nation. It will be hard for the current corp of leaders to beat the high benchmarks set by pioneer generation and the 2nd. Since u are the 2nd generation like others who come around the mid's 90 during GCT-era, I encourage u and others to beat the highest bars set up by the Old Guards. It's the only way forward for now. I fondly remembered how LKY and his right-hand man totally ban guns in Singapore. It came with very strict conditions. Young LKY was needed to be very strict with no-nonsense style. It was the only way for Singapore to thrive into a thriving city. When I looked at Malaysia, it's coming up with guns to shoot people in broad daylight. I never thankful enough to be here.

678116922217802_112439189,"My current fear is that there is no productivity growth in the construction industry despite all the effort. Recent hike of foreign constructon workers' levy and restriction of foreign workers entry was a failure that simply caused inflated cost and longer construction time for completion. The contractors I spoke to all commented that NO PRODUCTIVITY GAIN will come out of these policies. They simply pass the cost and delays to the developers. Some contractors with committed projects at old prices have already gone bankrupt because of this hike in levy. So how can we improve productivity? We need to help a few subcontractos in each trade improve their methods, technology and management skills. We need to eliminate those wasteful practices on jobsites which the maincons create to pass risk and cost to the subcons. When some are more competitive than others, that's when the competition begins. Raising the levy simply create a new expesnive level playing field. That is definitely not working today. LKY's latest book says that if you remove the foreign workers, the SMEs will collapse. He also said the reason of the current policy to restrict foreign workers is a political one due to public pressures. I felt that Singapore govt has always valued long term perspective.

662437937119034_112435945,"""Fearlessness may be a gift, but perhaps most precious is the courage acquired through endeavor, courage that comes from cultivating the habit of refusing to let fear dictate one's actions, courage that could be described as 'grace under pressure' ‚Äî grace which is renewed repeatedly in the face of harsh, unremitting pressure.
Within a system which denies the existence of basic human rights, fear tends to be the order of the day. Fear of imprisonment, fear of torture, fear of death, fear of losing friends, family, property or means of livelihood, fear of poverty, fear of isolation, fear of failure. A most insidious form of fear is that which masquerades as common sense or even wisdom, condemning as foolish, reckless, insignificant or futile the small, daily acts of courage which help to preserve man's self-respect and inherent human dignity. It is not easy for a people conditioned by fear under the iron rule of the principle that might is right to free themselves from the enervating miasma of fear. Yet even under the most crushing state machinery courage rises up again and again, for fear is not the natural state of civilized man.""

None of the N95 masks is fit for a child particularly pre-schoolers. The mask is bigger than the face of some children.

In view of the frequent reminder by NEA that the haze may get worse or always return, can authority like NEA or MOH advise the right product code for kids' face mask or where to get this supply that is fitting for children?

We are, of course, advised to keep our children to stay indoors at home with our windows shut in event of a haze crisis. But please understand most HDB flats owners have air-conditioning in all the bedrooms except living room. And it can be very warm within such shut enclosure in the living room for a long day which children are usually very sensitive to non-ventilation.

Mr Leong further asked, ""By the way, did any of the other town councils have a decrease in their MA rate from 2011 to 2012, like Tampines' and Holland-Bukit Timah's?""

And since Tampines' and Holland-Bukit Timah's MA rates were lower than AHTC's, Mr Leong asked why did Tampines and Holland-Bukit Timah increase their S & CC last year, whereas AHTC decreased theirs?

618451071517721_112041081,"We may delude ourselves to think that we have a meritocratic scholarship system in Singapore but there are elitist schools amongst us (read ACS, RGS, RI, Nan Yang Primary School, etc) and the highly sought after tuition centers which only the rich can afford (The Learning Lab to name one).....the ever insightful Ngiam Tong Dow has this to say: ""Paradoxically, this income divide is seeded in our deep belief in meritocracy. In the past, equal opportunities in education have provided the social mobility to enable the bright boy from a poor family to make good. The playing field was level for all students.

The spread of private tuition has changed the educational playing field. During my school days, only the academically weak students of rich parents take remedial tuition. Taking private tuition was not a badge of honour. Today, any parent who can afford the fees will send their children not for remedial but enhancement classes to give their children a head-start over their classmates.

Though there will still be the exceptional individual who triumphs against all odds, more and more of our state scholars will come from upper, middle income families with professional parents. There is no easy answer to the problem of an uneven playing field in our schools. In itself, private tuition is unalloyed free enterprise which society should encourage, not frown upon.

The challenge is to level up, not to level down. One suggestion I have is to make classes for academically weaker children smaller. The student-teacher ratio should be more favourable than in brighter classes so that the teacher can give more personal attention to each student, which is what private tuition is all about.""",Aurelia Tan,1,2013-04-20 06:14:20

618451071517721_112041594,"First off, I'm not sure we're all in agreement as to what we mean when we talk about meritocracy.  If meritocracy means an obsession with quantification, test-scoring, and qualifications, then there is really nothing inherently meritorious about meritocracy. If it's about giving individuals opportunities based on merit, that's fine. But it's not fine if academic credentials (or other irrelevant criteria such as performance in sports or mother tongue for an opportunity that has nothing to do with such achievement) are the only objective measure of merit.
Hierarchy is not just based on what happened to you at age 18. It happened even earlier ‚Äì at 9 (for the GEP screening) and 12 (for the PSLE which determine not just which secondary school, but also which JC you go to), and if you didn't make it, again at 16 or 17. These days, with the cut-off for the top JC at less than 3 points, it's not possible for any student going through the O level route to get in even with the best possible academic results (ie 6 A1s) if they do not also have bonus points from CCA or HMT. And there is a huge difference in terms of opportunities available to those from the top JCs and those from the others eg information and help in scholarship or college applications. How many scholars do we have that are not from the top JCs? And how many from the more popular courses in our local universities are not from the top JCs? How many who are not from the top JCs made it to Oxbridge or the Ivies?
 I do not agree that the US is not meritocratic enough in the school system, compared to us. It is true that their public schools may not be in the best of shape, but I've known of many from disadvantaged background who made it through to good universities, some with scholarships. Actually, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is one of them. Many of their public universities are ranked amongst the best in the world, ahead of their private colleges or even some of the Ivies. On the other hand, it is a lot more difficult for someone from a neighborhood school to make it to the more popular courses in our local universities these days, compared to 20 years ago. Those who are not strong in the sciences or humanities are disadvantaged up to JC and don't stand much of a chance even if they're applying for courses in a totally different area eg law, business, and accounting. 
How good a school is is very much dependent on the type of students it has. Well, all our schools are good schools. But there are better schools where we don't find students smoking or engaging in certain behavior while in their school uniforms. And I doubt the good schools (especially at secondary level) are good enough for the children of the ministers. These good schools are no better than the US public schools. If that mean they're not meritocratic enough in their school system, the same goes for us. You may say that entry into our secondary school is by merit. But it is not. There are schools that take in students from their affiliated primary school regardless of grades, or at a much lower cut-off.  The other difference is that families who can afford to pay send their children to private schools in the US, while those in Singapore send them to expensive tuition classes.",Charis Mun,2,2013-04-20 12:51:12

618451071517721_112043595,"hi Mr Tharman Sir, I read with interest many of the articles on straits times 'Ask DPM Tharman special' and articles here. I very much agree with the many view points. 

I once posted in a forum blurb an analogy such that if we imagine Singapore to be a v tiny island where 4 person is ok, 5 persons is a little crowded and with the 6th person is almost standing in the sea. 

it is inevitable that a somewhat socialist (to an extend in a light of Keynesian economics) would be helpful to the lower income group, i.e. for the richer among the 6 to help the poorest a little (note however there is an issue of moral hazard which its own topic, won't delve into it here.)

however, then the rest of the lot (lets say the middle income group) become the *sandwich class* since the above policies would basically be zero sum games, someone's gains is another's losses or benefits today may become higher taxes in future (this is basically similar to borrowing & spending and ending up needing to payback large sums with interest later)

i.e. the *sandwich class* are unlikely to benefit from many of the zero sum games policies and would possibly  appreciate the govt's efforts less since they're after all not the benefactors and perhaps even net contributors in the policies

hence the article ""Economy: look overseas, firms and workers told"" makes a lot of sense as that's probably the only way to grow a bigger cake for every 1 in singapore & growing the local economy.

but this is 'hard' from different perspectives, e.g. it requires a lot of *skills* and *knowledge* of how to do it to prosper from the regional and global economy, perhaps it helps through public education, govt linked efforts e.g. in some countries IT and such businesses push for GDCs (global development centers, global / regional shared service centers) etc, for high end manufacturing (pharmaceuticals), for financial services e.g. hedge/mutual funds, insurance, etc to be centered in singapore etc, for global internet firms (e.g. like facebook, google) in scale to grow out of and be based in singapore etc, but these ventures won't be easy to setup & grow without some kind of backing and skills injection. not to mention that as other countries are involved we may even see some trade friction, protectionism. 

of course, the other v common option is for a portion of singapore to travel and work overseas as well, e.g. setting up overseas subsidiaries

Perhaps you can explain how you can achieve what you said.                               In a Facebook post Tuesday morning, Nizam clarified that his pull-out reinforces how he is not seeking ""political mileage"" after deciding to drop his position at the Malay/Muslim self-help group and speak at the upcoming protests instead.

As Nizam rubbished suggestions he was using AMP for political gains, he said he is in favour of a strong civil society and diverse views for Singapore to be resilient.

""This will also allow my family and I to take a step back and have some quiet time on May Day for us to heal and to restrengthen our bonds,"" said Nizam.]

The charitable organisation from which a Muslim civil society leader resigned as director over alleged government efforts to stifle his airing of critical views declined to make further comment on the issue.

A spokesperson for the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP) instead referred Yahoo! Singapore to a statement made on Tuesday by AMP chairman Azmoon Ahmad.

In the statement, Azmoon clarified that Nizam Ismail quit the organisation ""to avoid further misperception"" that his activities were linked to AMP's stand on political and civil society issues.

Azmoon also said that suggestions of external parties influencing his or the AMP board's decisions are ""inaccurate"".

""AMP holds closely to our core principles of independence, non-partisanship and critical collaboration with all parties that share our mission in the community, including other Malay/Muslim organisations, non-Malay/Muslim organisations, national bodies and agencies, and the government,"" said Azmoon.

In a post on his personal blog Wednesday, Nizam Ismail explained why he decided to quit as board director of the AMP and chairman of the Centre for Research on Islamic and Malay Affairs (RIMA) effective earlier that Monday.

Nizam said that AMP chairman Azmoon Ahmad called him on Saturday to say that he received separate phone calls from two government ministers expressing concern over Nizam's participation as a speaker at next week's May Day protest at Hong Lim Park.

The protest, organised by Gilbert Goh of transitioning,org, is to be a follow-up to an earlier protest criticising the Singapore government's top range projection of a 6.9 million population by 2030.

The ministers were also said to be concerned about Nizam's participation as a panelist at a Youth Wing Youthquake Seminar for the opposition Workers' Party and his critical leanings on social media.

Azmoon relayed a message that Nizam should ""take it easy"" and decline participation from such activities, or else, the government would withdraw all funding from AMP.

Nizam said that Azmoon suggested Nizam ""disassociate"" himself from AMP if he were to continue with the activities.

Saying he was appalled by the alleged threats of withdrawal of funding from AMP on account of activities he had done in his ""personal capacity"", Nizam deplored what appeared to be ""political reasons"" behind them.

""I could not, as a matter of principle, see myself functioning as an activist in AMP or RIMA's Board in an imposed non-critical state, in return for continued funding of AMP's programs,"" Nizam said of his decision to resign from the two organisations.

Nizam also alleged that the latest incident was not the only attempt at influencing AMP, which was established in 1991 as a non-partisan group to help Malays and Muslims in Singapore.

State funding of AMP's programs were cut in the wake of a proposal in 2000 for a collective community leadership and threats of funding cuts were also made in reaction to a the group's proposal in 2012 for an independent Community Forum, Nizam claimed.

""The readiness to use the threat of withdrawal of funding when the State feels displeased or threatened also ignores this important fact ‚Äì that these funds are being used to fund programs which benefit thousands of beneficiaries ‚Äì be they low-income families, youths at risks, [and] students,"" he said.

""The interests of these beneficiaries seem to be readily steamrolled,"" he added.

As of Thursday evening, Nizam's name had been removed from the AMP's board of directors' page on the organisation's website though his profile page was still live. His name had also been removed from RIMA's page.

In reply to the matter, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim said to Berita Harian that the government does not interfere with the internal affairs of Malay/Muslim organisations. However, he stressed that government help should not be used to fund political motives.

""What is clear from the comments made from Nizam is his wish to be more politically-active. The government considers AMP as an important Malay/Muslim self-help group like Mendaki, and offers assistance to help AMP handle social and education issues in our community. However, this assistance should not be used to aid political activities or self-help groups to carry out political agendas,"" said Yaacob.

At MOF side, banks have been cleaned up recently and can only support loans for nett purchase value after rebate, which is correct and proper. Will MND continue to allow caveats to be registered at before rebates price? This will mean that distortion in national statistical prices will again persist, and this time round, about 5-15percent. How does MND intend to tackle that? Pls clarify. We hope the ministries have the will to thoroughly clean up such data distortions once and for all.

If govt is educating financial prudence, why is it that latest CPF 2011 Cash Flow statement denotes that it has low cash flow & high investment assets & are these the reasons contributing to current high minimum CPF sum & low draw out for Singaporeans? Shouldn't the govt be more financially prudent to not use so much of our CPF funds for investment so that more CPF funds can be dispersed to us when we have a choice to retire at 55 yrs old & it's up to our financial prudence to spend our CPF funds thereafter?

595538743808954_111936622,"Marianne, please be assured - CPF funds are completely safe. You can refer to this website clarifying various questions (see Q19) on our reserves and the CPF. The CPF Minimum Sum policy is entirely independent of our reserves. We inherited an unusual provident fund system from the British, in which originally everyone could take their money out at 55. Few countries have anything similar, and the UK changed their own system many years ago. In most countries, no money is taken out at 55, and one instead gets an annuity-like payment like under the CPF Life Scheme. Even then, in many developed countries, the social security system is now approaching insolvency. Our CPF is totally secure. We have revised it in steps over the years, and even today it is different from most other systems because one can  take out a fair amount of money at 55 based on a housing pledge. Whatever we do to refine the scheme must aim at serving members' interests in old age, especially as Singaporeans are living much longer now, fortunately. Best rgds, TS",Tharman Shanmugaratnam,7,2013-03-03 11:30:28
595538743808954_111936682,"Mr Tharman: Tks for replying personally, we respect u for that. However, thousands of middle class families like us are seriously affected by many issues like increased cost of living & the latest policies on decreasing COE has just added oil to the fuel as we hardly hv any excess savings due to risen cost on everything & in fact I can say only air is free in Singapore currently. Like I mentioned, with the latest policies on COE, it poses even more financial difficulties for us to find jobs & retain current jobs if we are pursuing sales jobs... In regards to the CPF, honestly, there will always be questions on accountability & transparency issues if GIC's investment portfolio & returns remain ""hidden"", so of course many Singaporeans will be concerned about getting back our CPF monies since they are the main source of savings all our lives as we understand that our CPF funds could be invested. So how can our CPF funds be protected if these investments fail especially in such enormous amounts of over $207 billions & low cash of $480 millions which can hardly repay retirees nowadays? We dread to think about the even higher CPF minimum fund & low draw out if we retire in about 10 to 15 yrs time, we definitely do not want to go to CPF board to beg them to return to us if we truly need the money to sustain our daily living cost or to retire gracefully at ease...In comparing our CPF system with Europe is impractical to us as our neighbour, Malaysia, is able to dispense 30% of the CPF monies at 50 yrs old & 100% at 55 yrs'old & even at a high interest of more than 6% annually, can ur cabinet do a study on such feasibility & we will be grateful for that initiatives...Even with the Medisave, despite us having substancial amount, the withdrawal is so low annually which is totally insufficient to cover our medical needs, so I hope that the government would be more humane & compassionate to give us back our hard earned CPF monies & let us use 100% of Medisave for our lifelong needs...If u continue with such CPF policies, more elderlys will end up being a burden to the govt & their families as they cannot withdraw their CPF monies to sustain their living & medical needs...Pls give us back our choice to be self sufficient so that we do not need govt & families' assistance.

My point is: Many of middle income families like us do not hv excess money to pay for the huge downpayment even for the 2nd hand car for single-income, so how to even consider double-income although govt wants women to come out to work...The policies totally ignored the financial difficulties faced by middle-income families with elderly & children like us.. Cars are not a want by us, it's a need for us to find a new sales job or to retain the current sales job & also to ferry kids to schools & elderlys for regular check-ups..They are seriously going to lose alot of votes from middle income families like us as we did not benefit much from the budget anyway.",Marianne Tan,0,2013-03-03 14:38:55

Many of Singaporeans are hungry for lower cost of living with better quality of life which had yet to be achieved so far, in fact, lives has deteriorated for us past few yrs.. So many issues.. almost everything is going wrong..It  is my humble opinion that all ministers with different portfolios to be communicating with one another coz the exisiting & revised policies clearly show that they are not really integrated with further mind searching & thoughts about the negative implications to most Singaporeans at large..For eg, few yrs ago, when MOM started to open floodgate for many foreigners, why is it that there was not any planned increased spending in  pucblic infrastructure to cope with the flow? Similarly, the latest measure in reducing COE is contradictory to MOM's move to maintain increasing number of jobs for Singaporeans including women coz many Singaporeans will be losing their sales jobs in the near future & women are unable to find sales jobs due to the hefty downpayment for the double income family to help with coping higher living cost...Furthermore, the increase of foreign workers' levies ( does PAP really understand that we welcome foreign workers to cover jobs that Singaporeans shun but not foreign talents that take away our PMET jobs??) of up to $1050 per mth up till 2015 will indirectly increase cost to be passed to us consumers via housing, F & B...etc. Hope that the cabinet can work together to formulate more rounded & beneficial policies & do not leave anyone of us behind again as we are determined to vote for alternative parties in 2016 if there are no improvements again..

From no payment of property tax in the past to pay around $44 for year 2013! Quite a shock for many Singaporean owners. It's a right move to increase the Annual Value taxable from first $6000 to $8000 instead so that 3 room flat owners need not pay. Good action.",Tan Pat,4,2013-02-25 15:15:58

592968960732599_111924665,"For example, I have spoken to Pang Yan Mui, senior valuation officier, IRAS just last Friday after I have e-mailed and spoken to her a few times about half year ago.
However she mentioned changes if there is any (no solution till date) may require till end of this year.
1) Why the DBSS owners need to pay more than 2 weeks of property tax to IRAS when owners haven't collect keys as the staff from the Hoi Hup inform owners that we can only claim the '10%' taxes? Is it right for the developer/IRAS to do so? Does any regulation been violated? Yet Bishan-Toa Payoh Town council don't collect much of service & conservancy charges for the above period as mentioned in our conversation as they are aware of our 'key collection' date and even meet up with the owners.

2) How come IRAS instructs property owners to pay first on behalf of the developer for the '10%' tax when the date of the bill(eve of National day) is more than 3 months from TOP? This will inconvenience thousands of owners when IRAS can just collect tax directly from developer.

3) How come IRAS didn't at least remind owners clearly in the August property bill that owners can get reimbursement from developers yet ironically owners need to pay 5% penalty when owners didn't pay by the due date even for those taxes where owners are not liable to pay?

4) In our conversation, you also mentioned that ECs owners are also affected from the above. So till date how many thousands of ECs/DBSS owners are overcharge to pay for the developers instead? How many didn't seek reimbursement from developers which IRAS can easily check and verify with them.

5) As my estimate that over a thousand of owners of The Peak@Toa Payoh (mostly Singaporeans) are affected with overtax of about a hundred thousand($100 000) or more being billed to owners instead of the developer how can IRAS do to solve the problem. If majority didn't seek reimbursement due to the inconvenience shouldn't IRAS take action to provide a solution eg inform/instruct and monitor that the developer will pay all owners who have paid the 'developer's tax' to IRAS already. How about other EC/DBSS owners eg City View@Boon Keng,etc which can be easily over a million dollars 'extra' taxes collected by IRAS where most buyers are Singaporeans and not aware of seeking reimbursement of tax when property tax bill didn't indicate clearly?http://bgbiz.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10297p.nsf/ImageView/SITES_SOLD_-_RESIDENTIAL_DBSS/$file/DBSSMaster+development+(30+April+2012).pdf",Tan Pat,0,2013-02-25 15:44:17

On behalf of other DBSS owners we 'thank you' very much. Also the other 7 DBSS sites, collection of keys will be coming soon, hopefully IRAS can collect the 10% taxes directly from the developers instead of say the thousands of DBSS owners and improve on 'productivity' efficiency so that millions of  taxpayers can benefit.

If the policies do not address those bottom issues that concern Singaooreans regarding the total cost of raising children, they'll not have more children. This is a long-term issue that the policies need to address now. A simple and sensible way is to increase, in a significant way, the tax rebate for each child.",Michael Yang,3,2013-02-25 21:00:47
592968960732599_111925298,"Michael Yang, I agree with ur point abt formulating policies should not be solely on the type of property. It should look at both, type of property n per capita. Some households have a few income earners albeit low or middle income and smaller type of property thereby per capita household income is high whereas another household can have a bigger property (multi generation in it) solely having one or two income earners in d middle income level yet d per capita is lower for there are young children/elderly/disabled who aren't income earners to contribute to the household income. Rebates/credits for the young ones can only be realized wen they are of nursery/childcare goin age with the proposed budget, what about the age prior to childcare and post childcare? That's where per capita policies becomes crucial. Having unemployed elderly/disabled in the household also puts a strain on the one or two middle income earners. I am not saying the Budget should finance any family expenses per say yet I am seeking for the Budget to take into considerations that d sandwiched middle income earners don't qualify for assistance (base on their income) yet if their household income is assess base on per capita, they would perhaps fall in the category of lower income.",Rashidah Mahmud,3,2013-02-25 23:09:17

592968960732599_111925487,"Dear DPM Mr Tharman, we like to seek your attention to the improvement of productivity on civil services sector : HDB under MND: In the 5 years plan for Nee Soon GRC released around April 2011, all shop units around Yishun bus interchange already need to vacant their premises before National day of 2011 and to be replaced by the new bus interchange/shopping mall/condo in late 2011 or early 2012. However the delay demolition of the shop units only start around June/July 2012.                                              
Yet from HDB website, the just released in early Jan 2013 (http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10330p.nsf/w/LandDevMangGovtLand?OpenDocument ) for open tender on the development of the above plot of land will only begin this coming June 2013. Why yet again further delay? Can't this further delay be shorten to say open tender for this plot of land to be during March this year instead so that to fulfill the 5 years plan for Nee Soon GRC? According to Ms Zheng Meishan, Exec Land Adm Manager - HDB, our beloved Minister Mr K Shanmugam and MP Dr Muhammad Faishal have a meeting with HDB personnel in late Dec 12/ early Jan 13 regarding the delay and a further meeting with Dr Faishal on 18 Jan 2013. Many residents have called HDB officers throughout last year and even written to both the MP - Dr Faishal and HDB more than a month ago since mid-January 2013 but no direct answers to the above delay in their multiple replies till this moment. We have even written our agony on the Facebook of Minister of National Development, Mr Khaw Boon Wan over a month ago with the MND Facebook admin acknowledgement but till date no reply! 

 To strengthen my point as Singaporeans, this delay of over one and a half year before the open tender for the above plot of land result in the loss of millions of dollars as HDB vacant those shop units over a year earlier eg with 30 shop units - premier location surronding Yishun bus interchange of monthly rent of say $9000 over 12 months (excluding coffee shops rental which are very much higher) - loss of over $3 millions revenue for government fund! If including the coffeeshops rental it can easily exceed over $5 million! Isn't the CEO of HDB and related planning officers accountable? As millions of Singaporeans are yearly income taxpayers or daily gst payers and some paying yearly property tax which increase this year (from no payment of property tax for 3 room flat in the past to paying ~$44 for 2013), we have the right to know. So a further delay by HDB will not be good for the residents and non-residents likewise as it will 'worsen' the '5 years plan for Nee Soon GRC' under the well-loved leadership of Mr K Shanmugam. Also further delay will lead to more waste of millions of dollars of collectible rental funds as explained earlier. Sir, most Singaporeans would like to know 'Why the delay, who is accountable and what actions to prevent further delay in future' so as to improve productivity for usage of taxpayers' fund.

Not for status purposes but for ferrying elderly, handicapped, young children. You have acknowledge yourself how the transport systems are heavily strained with the increased population, how do we move about with our elderly, disabled and young kids on these systems? COEs collected from the rich should be channeled as rebates to reduce the COEs for those with real needs on a tiered basis.

Your scheme is also too tedious to implement, but also. Elderly is only parents or aunties also can? Then elderly buy his own car counted? Elderly can walk counted? IF rich people buy car got elderly also got rebate? How young is young children? And your young children grow old no more rebate? Or once they are not young you have to pay back the additional 30%?

Why young children or elderly must have car? In the past we used to bring my grandparents on the bus. As young children we have to learn how to take our own bus since primary school. If because of convenience and you find them a burden, then you aren't really loving your family.

Tan Kin Lian
I don't like Budget 2013. I also don't like past years' Budgets. 

Although the Finance Minister is quite generous in giving GST vouchers, productivity and innovation credits and the wage subsidy, it is a wasteful approach. 

It is better to address the root cause of the high costs of living and the high cost of doing business. The approach that I prefer is to reduce or totally remove the GST.

The 40% co-funding of the increase in wages can backfire. How to determine the increase for new employees? If new employees are not counted, the employer can recruit new employees at a low salary and give a big increase after a few months, to qualify for the subsidy.

592968960732599_111927298,"i would like to see the various govt agencies working together to solve issues together. taking the revamp for the purchase of cars for example. if i'm not mistaken, it is to curb the rising price of cars as well as to help reduce the total number of vehicles on the road. work with LTA for a more comprehensive plan on how to tackle the issues

traffic congestion is not just due to the raw number of vehicles. road planning and enforcement also play a role. as what i can see from my commutes, a part of the congestion is due to the inefficient use of vehicular lanes. for example, a heavy truck at 50kmh occupies lane 4. a smaller truck moving at 60 kmh overtakes the truck but doesnt move back to lane 4 as the driver doesnt want the hassle overtaking and stays on lane 3. now a private bus driver in a hurry overtakes them both on lane 2 and refuse to move back into lane 3. this leads to a van, which is speeding at 85 kmh, to use lane 1. there could be a little more enforcement in this area to ensure smooth traffic flow. this difference of speeds also raises the chance of accidents

we also need to look at COE itself. at present it is a ""who has $$$ who gets it"" system. yes it does filter out those who do not have a need for a vehicle and yet buy one but it also puts the vehicle out of reach of a family that needs it. the new revamp to vehicle loan rules seems to have such an effect as well. maybe the different agencies should work together and implement a fairer way of distributing the COEs. allow families buying a car to ferry their 3 kids and 2 aged parents to submit documents for review so they can purchase a car. set aside a certain percentage of COEs for this purpose. have background checks on the registered address of the purchaser. should there be already multiple cars registered at the same address, a premium can then be placed. this would make more families to pool their resources together. as to the loan amount and loan period, similar plans could be made ie increasing the loan sum or loan period, for the people that need a car. of course, some may question the definition of ""need"", which could be subjective

as others have already raised, the public transport system really need massive improvements. try bringing 3 children to the beach on a weekend. i will not comment on the graciousness of the commuters but just focus on the difficulty of 2 adults handlng 3 children who may be running about or screaming or crying. even with my current 1 child, i was embarrassed when she started crying on the train as i felt i was disturbing the other commuters. should i try hire a cab when i'm going out with my parents, i could only wait for the 6/7 seaters as the normal cabs will not pick up 5 adults and a child

in summary, i would like a concerted effort in rolling out measures rather than a stop gap kind of approach by individual agencies. it just seems very unproductive",Joseph Lee,0,2013-02-27 01:02:11
592968960732599_111927523,"Jack Lin, yes really. Inflation will reduce savings value provided you have surplus to keep as savings. I studied Accounting so I know the difference between a depreciating asset and an investment. To avoid the 24% interest on CC that is why I pay my CC bills in full. Y to hv CCs? to utilize 0% instalment plans for household puchases like refrigerator, washing machine, fans, etc since I cant afford a lumpsum. Of your question of rushing in to buy a car. I am not in a rush for my Toyota car still hv 4 more years to go. But I know how families like me will feel with the newly implemented COE policies. U mentioned 'in the past' you used to take your grandparents on the bus, will you do the same with our current bus situations? With age, you will experience greatly reduced agility and strength and vision (does not mean you cant walked, cant see). Young kids have yet to be independent to take public transport on their own. Handicap person in a pack train/bus, do spend time observing if you find many of them on public transport in SG. It is not because they are pampered or not daring enough, but our strained transport systems dont have room for them (indeed many able bodied persons too find it a challenge to take public transport these days). With the increasing singles population in SG, why should Aunties and Uncles be excluded if you are their guardian/responsible for their well-being (provided they dont have their own car)?  I admit it is cheaper to take cab, take for instance my family, for my family to move about, we will have to take 2 cabs, will that be cheaper for me then ? D roads are congested because many people have cars since they can afford to pay for d convenience (luxury). But for families at certain per capita income, especially with handicapped and elderly parents, it becomes a necessity instead of a luxury. I admit there would be admin/paperwork involved to implement my suggested COE rebate scheme, but it is doable.

My father was a government pensioner getting S$400, and my four older siblings gave little help. I managed to secure scholarships in good foreign universities abroad, and financed over 90% of my own education. Upon seeing the dire low fertility rate in Singapore, I felt a sense to get married even though I entered my fifties. Now I am supporting my wife also who is 16 years younger than me. I am therefore now looking at supporting the fourth generation in my family. The current economic situation is such that I may not be able to retire anytime soon or at all!",Chandra Venugopal,0,2013-03-02 12:04:43
592968960732599_111936204,Clearly quite a bit of work to steer this ship back on course. We await with bated breath on the transformation of Singapore. Some of my thoughts,Linus Leen,0,2013-03-03 05:26:12
592968960732599_111936217,1. Not enough enducation of industry segments and job opportunity to the young. Bring complanies from simlar industries to sponsor job placement fairs. Give them the voice to Educational Institutes. Change their peception that they need to hire abroad to get the talent. Incentivise them to take the talents from our excellent eduction institutions and groom them instead.   2. 200k maids adds to the foreign worker burden. Make live in mads easy for families that need it like the ones that have very young children etc and make it difficult for the rest. 3. Be brave and remove the systems that don't work (should we move away from the GCE system and be heavier on the IB - we want our childern to be successful after they graduate and not juste celebrate their educational successes.

592968960732599_111949504,"Hope that in the next round of review on the car loan limits, we could at least make it easier for family with 3rd child to buy a 2nd hand small car (still within financial prudence, if nec, those more than 5 years old). A family of 5 (esp when the children are older) can find it difficult to hire a normal taxi due to the typical seating capacity limit of 4 passengers. This can be another pro-family measure. Ideally, the same suggestion can be applied to family with babies, if this relaxation does not compromise significantly the effectiveness of the car loan measures on COE prices.",Sim Sim,0,2013-03-09 04:21:28

592968960732599_112861643,"The MAS announced certain exemptions on the TDSR and MSR today.  This comes two days after Kwek Leng Beng- a billionaire who made his riches by selling homes - appealed for removal of the cooling measures.

Will the ABSD be tweaked?
Will there be further loosening of the TDSR&MSR?

Yes, COVs are coming down.  However, COV alone is not a real indication of home prices as valuations have increased at least some 30pc since 2009.

Any further loosening of the cooling measures would be premature and drive prices further up north....",TF Liang,0,2014-02-10 12:20:50

But now we are already packed and filled in terms of population dense. I don't mean to politicise this heartwarming story but I also hope it is not a subtle propagation on why the White Paper is good for us the same way it is good for old Mr Piong.

Naturally, a lower staff overhead is the first to be adjusted but that move comes with a heavy price. You throw peanuts, you get monkeys. Perhaps operators should come up with more creative remuneration packages that will allow the staff to have a share when it comes to profits.

There are many reasons and factors for such a ""phenomena"" (going by SG standards), I.e Homogeneity, culture, pride, cost n standards of living. However, from my observations, clearly government policies are not the main driving factors. 
So what drives good service?
In my view, ownership and empowerment. Business Management theories, psychological studies and many philosophical thinking have shown that it takes more than just externalities in order for one to push oneself harder or further. 
What makes one go the extra mile? Carrot or stick? Or both?
When one looks to buy oneself a mobile phone, a dinner dress or a fancy dinner, one will likely take some time n spend some effort to at least consider a few factors before arriving at the ""best"" decision.

Son was ashamed and disliked his father because his father did not stop working in the coffee shop even after he asked him to stop. The father continued to work there because he was respected and appreciated. 
When the son was strapped for cash, it was his cleaner father who rescued his business. Moral of the story was respect all occupations. Respect one's choice of employment.

They feel that the extremely high rental, which will only go up every year due to the heavy presence of REITS here, has caused it to be very unattractive to do business here. Therefore they will try to cut cost in every way possible, including hiring cheaper workers. 
Some also indicated difficulty in hiring Singaporeans, who seem to have poorer work attitude and tend not to stay in the job. They therefore prefer to hire foreigners who can be trained and are more like to stay in the job.

a) what's with the long list of terms & conditions that we have to agree to when using their websites, that indemnify them from any responsibility whatsoever & place all the burden on the website users? 
b) why are MOM/WDA websites only accessible during selected hours of the day?  Is it to convenience civil servants, but at users' expense?  Don't they know we are busy running our businesses during the day, & might need to log in at night?
c) Recently I changed our business address, & informed ACRA accordingly.  I was shocked when NEA sent their licence renewal notice to the old address - as a result, we were late for our renewal.  This only goes to show that government agencies don't share information with each other, as appropriate.
My conclusion therefore is that public agencies also have to improve their own productivity, such as in handling applications by companies or requests by citizens.

As my son completed 6 years of primary school in 2012, I can only conclude the formula being taught is to get students to keep repeatedly working on problem sums so that they master the exam and ace it.  There was very little emphasis on working smart, real learning, real delivery of any results other than exam scores.  This, I believe, has led to a culture where service is not important, but one where beating the rest and getting maximum money for minimum effort with little regard for real contribution to service or how we impact others has become the norm (Just look at driver behaviour).  To me, it is not about rentals, or manpower policies, but the root problem is the culture we have built over the last few decades.  This will take a generation to change, and it starts with the leaders.  Are we willing to sacrifice economic growth for whilst we rethink?  Or are we going to continue the tactical rather than strategic long-term approach?  What are we going to do with the fact that Singaporeans are an unhappy lot?

How much more productive can workers be? We have 2 hands and 2 legs and we are humanly limited by space and time.

After which, the landlord will review the profit of the business and increase rental prices accordingly. So increase productivity by 300% after that?

I have observed the difference between our workers and their counterparts overseas for years (in Korea, Thailand, Australia etc) and often wondered why there was such a difference. Having more workers does not cut it, having quality workers is what is important. I went to a fish and chips outlet a year ago and was quite disappointed with the service. I went to another of their outlets recently and was pleasantly surprised by the waiter and waitresses that served us, professional...dramatic change...they are doing something right. One of the problems we face is that many people view jobs like sales at retail outlets as low class, low pay, not respectable. Same with waiters and waitresses, same with those in the building industry and many other jobs. Over time this became a reality because of these views. Our society and also in part the government has created these views - unconsiously, and this needs to change. There is nothing wrong with doing a sales job at a retail outlet - do it professionally, there is nothing wrong with being awaiter - again but do it professionally, there is nothing wrong with being a brick layer - but do a first class job of it.",Robert Oh,2,2013-01-14 05:55:17

567373639958798_111833918,"Sorry let me continue. Firstly we hire wrong people for the job and they dont get the right tools. I once walked past some workers painting the yellow line on the side of the road. There were 3 of them. One was holding a string so the other could paint a striaght line, the second man was doing the painting and the third a supervisor had his hands folded just watching. Obviously you are not going get a lot of productivity out of that. They did not have the tools ad often the foriegn workers we hire dont even have the language skills nor job skills so obviously once again we will not get a lot of productivity out of them and the language skills dont allow for easy upgrading. By the time we train them up they go some place else, I dont mean another company I mean another country. Take maids for instance. Many come with little or no experience, after 2 years they leave and go elsewhere where they get more pay, so we bear the cost of training. We then take on the next maid and the cyle continues. Continuing on the issue of language I was in a counry once and the immigration officer a lady could hardly speak english. She asked me 'Where is my visa?' But what she said was more like 'WHat is your visa'. I was a little confused so she asked again. By the time she asked the thrid time she was raising her voice, so I said you mean 'Where is my visa?', I then quickly added 'No visa'. We don't need a visa to enter her country, as an immigation officer surely she should know that. Language is an issue affecting delivery of services. Then there is my observation of a mee pok stall that I observed. There were 3 persons. One was cooking, another collecting the money and the third person getting the spoons and chopsticks for the customers. No doubt the one doing the cooking was very busy and the other 2 didnot have much to do, here we have a deployment problem - not effective. There are other issues but no need for me to go on I think. There are many issues and each has to be resolved one by one some by government policy, some by individual employees, some by management of companies, some through training, job scope redesign, emphasis on pay for skills and teamwork etc etc. A multi-prong approach is needed",Robert Oh,2,2013-01-14 09:23:15

Why don't you serve a week in a restaurant with less staff, who are apparently well paid with more duties that brings in $12,000 a day and tell me if this is feasible. Firstly, many F&B outlets do not pay competitively. Secondly, less staff can mean longer waiting times at peak periods too. This leads to the question of just how tolerant Singaporean patrons can be? Less staff also means less hands to go around and shoulder the team's daily duties. They are seriously stretched thin! I am a fortunate 9am to 6pm paper pusher seated behind a comfy desk. Every time I dine in restaurants, my heart goes out to service staff scrambling to serve our every need. When we sit for down for a long lunch or a great dinner with friends, does it occur to us that these service staff don't get these luxurious lunch or dinner breaks? They are on their feet the whole day with only a half an hour to 45min break to get a bite to eat. Can you imagine eating at only 4pm when you've been at work since 9am? Less staff means less hands to go around when break time rolls around. In the end? Many staff don't eat or they cram food behind the counter in 5 mins and poof they're back to serving tables. I cringe every time I see a more than demanding customer gesture rudely at service staff- eh Hello! Where did basic courtesy go to?  They wear name badges for a reason. It's not just there for you to take their names downs to complain. Like you and I, they have feelings. As I grow older in this country I love and will always call home; I find myself greatly sadden and disturbed by the way we have become. Were we really brought up to be that intolerant and obnoxious? I long to be proud to say I am Singaporean when I stand in my expatriate filled office. But instead when I hear them trash Singaporeans, I stand there blushing because what they say is true. So DPM, please consider both sides of the coin before posting such things. This goes beyond stirring a lively debate. This involves real people with real struggles.

I have seen such restuarants myself while abroad, and I have observed some of our local restuarants like the J seafood restuarant are also moving in this direction.

Asset prices are bubbling like never before and business owners have difficulty meeting rent payments. F&B workers should be paid well so they m&a take pride in their jobs and perform the service well. Service charge of 10% should go to the employees or the tip box, and not the business owner. Given the already entrenched mind sets of us Singaporeans, I don't see a tipping culture becoming a possibility in the near future. That being said, much has to be done to improve the livelihood of waiters and the possibility of making a livelihood out of being a service staff, such that more Singaporeans may find it viable and take up such jobs.

We can expect many Singaporeans to voice their ideas in the coming months.  
This morning 16th Feb 2013 ST's Life has an article ""The rocky road to future growth"", and Workers' Party's letter in ST Forum: ""WP's position on foreign workers has been consistent"".
We can only expect the 'public mass protest' this afternoon at Hong Lim Park's Speakers' Corner will be boisterous in rejecting the White Paper in total.   However, I hope the speakers and aspiring politicians will put forth sound and solid suggestions as well.
In the months to come, there will be many suggestions but will the Govt really listen to the good ideas and take it into consideration and deliberate on it decisively?
2013 to 2030 ‚Äì 17 years
We can expect many senior politicians in Singapore will retire or pass on within these 17 years.
It will be the same in Indonesia and Malaysia.
Will the younger politicians of these 3 countries build up close rapport with confidence and trust among themselves free of past political emotional baggage to plan ahead?
What should they do in the coming years looking forward at what they want to achieve when they are in charge?
They might not agree on all things geo-politics but surely they can take steps to plan ahead in areas of economics and development to counter the threats for investments and jobs that could go to big states like China and India.
From economics and development there would be less hungry people.  There will be a better chance for their countries to be politically stable and free of turmoil and mass uprising. 
What are the threats economically and what should be done within these 17 years? 
Iskandar Shah in Johor and the Bataam and Bintan Islands in Indonesia are potentials to counter the threats for jobs and investments flowing towards China and India.
Will there be plans to make these places into future economic hubs thriving with activities and growth?
To achieve this will need lots of investments, capital and good infrastructures to make the connections for easy access to Singapore.
Where can Singapore fit in and what is in it that will make it win-win for all 3 countries?
Singapore has projected to grow its population to 6.9m by 2030.
Rather than allow in foreigners from far away countries, people who are not familiar with our culture in South-East Asia, it would be better for Singapore to look at Malaysia and Indonesia as the traditional sources to fill the gap in our labour force. 
To house a bigger population will mean building 700,000 residential units.   If we take an average of $100,000 in construction cost, it would mean investing $70bn in 17 years in housing.   
Housing a bigger population by investing $70bn.  Are there other alternatives?
We can look North or South for the alternatives.
If the foreign workers coming from Malaysia and Indonesia could reside there, and commute to Singapore to work, it would free the massive congestion that could be expected when the population reaches 6.5m or more in Singapore.
I hope the younger politicians of these 3 countries will work together to plan ahead on this for mutual benefits.
A] There is a need of a MRT rail line to connect Singapore to Johor.  If we cannot reclaim land on both sides of the Causeway to widen it, I hope land could be reclaimed to build the MRT line [tunnels under the Johor Straits will be expensive] with provisions for a future Rapid Rail to connect Singapore to Iskandar Shah and Kuala Lumpur.   The MRT line to Johor will mean developments in many economic activities other than housing in Southern Johor.   It will free Singapore from massive congestion with a huge population.   Instead of pumping $70b in 700,000 units of housing, I hope the Singapore Govt will work with the Malaysian/Johor Govt on this project with a timeline of 10 to 17 years to see it materialize.
B] If the younger politicians of Indonesia could work with their Singapore counterparts, there could be  a plan among them to build a tunnel/expressway/MRT rail connection from Singapore to Batam/Bintan.   This idea was mooted some 20 years ago but has not been forgotten by both sides as it has been kept in abeyance.   It would mean opportunities in many social activities not just economics when the physical connections are built.   Some of the $70bn could be deployed to build these physical infrastructures for workers from Indonesia to have residence in these 2 islands but find employment in Singapore.  It would free Singapore from massive people congestion when the population grows to above 6.5m by 2030.
C] If the physical connections in A and B are built, it would mean retirees might find it easier to commute and stay in Johor or these 2 Indonesian islands.   It would relieve congestion of people in Singapore and bring more economic activities to Johor, Batam and Bintan.",Tan Kok Tim,0,2013-02-16 06:55:15

Glad to read on your X'mas theme just like your insightful sharing for the earlier religious celebrations. My family is close to few Bosnian families here in Qatar & I can also relate your sharing as I'm still following the issues there. Also as a lesson on appreciating diversity to promote multi-racial & multi-religious harmony. I'm also glad you shared on the desecration of the shrines in Timbuktu by these extremist so-called Muslim group. I believe you know where they get their ideology from & its origin. Their influence has also starting to creep into our Muslim society back home & our neighboring countries challenging our traditional Muslim scholars. Their views are extremist & divisive & slowly affecting intra & inter-ethnic relations. Just a simple & recent example is that they forbid us Muslims from wishing our fellow Christians. Pls watch out for this group & also our students from going there to study. Anyway, have a wonderful holiday & family bonding time",Fazlur Rahman Bin Kamsani,6,2012-12-25 13:50:49

Without these key pillars, nepotism and cronyism would creep in and loads of pent-up anger would build up amongst minorities, and this can cut across religions, races and even nationalities ( as seen in recent SMRT saga).

557493477613481_111788270,"Where places of strife are, there are usually extremists views developed. Hence war and the lack of prosperity. I think it applies to all areas in life, be it racial issues, livelihood issues et cetra. Where there is a huge divide, we will see trouble. Where there are cultural differences failed to be tolerated, we will get war in either a physically violent one or a silent war that involves backstabbing fights. I think we may be entering an era where many areas globally will fight for survival due to a coming sea change of power alone. Anyway, if it were me picking an overseas trip, I'd rather pick a happy cheerful place. Not because I want to escape from the unhappy scene of reality but I think we need to have at least the festivities to enjoy some bits of total peace away from the daily rambles of human inflicted rubbish.

For peace, for cohesion and betterment for all within our own societies, and for our shared humanity! 
It is indeed tragic that all too often our human nature leads to intolerance and a lack of empathy and understanding towards others, but there is some redeeming quality in the sentiments of yourself and the like-minded individuals who may identify with your message and in the capacity of others to hold these beliefs for at least a few days out of the year.
Where then does the fault lay? Is it a lack of education? How can you teach people empathy?

I just want to share that where the views of the minority permeate and impose the majority of culture, there is bound to be exploitation of emotion that lead to strife and war. It takes a garnering of community to say enough is enough and garner support for peace and love. This is the christian and universal spirit Mr Tharma. But some ""wolf"" in religious disguise in nationalism can infuse religious fervor with personal ideology. Which is why Jesus mentioned, ""beware of the yeast of the pharisees..."" Much unintended innocent killings where due to fear, greed and uneven social opportunity .

Perhaps more flexibility can be given to curriculum and more freedom can be given to our educators to teach material that may not necessarily be examinable. 

i suppose that if teachers were only meant to be there to educate our young to excel in examinations, then we might just be nurturing a generation that is taught step by step on how to think and not given the opportunity to figure out things on their own which then defeats the purpose of education in general.

530837036945792_111669797,"Dear DPM, thank you for sharing your thoughts. It sounds that we are looking at incremental ""enhancements"" of the system rather than looking at a fundamental review of PSLE.  In my view, so long as we retain the high stake examinations (which has longer-term impact on the child's future) at such an early stage, nothing much will change.  

PSLE comes at a huge cost of learning.  The entire system - schools, principals, teachers, students, and admittedly, parents - is obsessed about getting exceptional PSLE scores.  That PSLE score would differentiate students, teachers, parents, principals and schools. 

I wonder if we are thinking hard enough for alternative framework.  Finland's more egalitarian approach on education (9 years of basic education without PSLE, streaming, Gifted programs) is one which we should look closely).  Finland's system is highly considered globally.  

You mentioned the need to retain our system in order not to erode confidence in Meritocracy.  At the same time, you mentioned that we should have more diversity in our top schools, but did not mention details.  Can you share your thoughts with us?  The need for diversity is important - in light of the ill effects of Meritocracy in making it harder for the have-nots to compete with the haves in society.

I agree with you that we should refocus to make sure that our children enjoy their childhood.  And enjoy learning.

Three years later, they led in math. By 2006, Finland was first out of 57 countries (and a few cities) in science.

530837036945792_111672977,"Education really imparts children. The mindset and attitude which they learnt and understood in their school days will affect them after they leave school. PSLE is also a really matter for nowadays parents. Parents wish their children to attend the best school that can lead their children in to the best. But schools and parents should assure children have correct mindset and attitude. Students in school learn knowledge; handle personal problem, civics and some important law that are seriously carry out. Parents should assure that their own children are in the correct track and need to lead their children in society. I use to help some parent to teach their children. I found children nowadays are very smart. They think their parent don't understand them, and what they need is the correct information and knowledge, but a lot of parent can't provide and not patient. I often heard children below 18, tell their parent to shut up, because you don't know my problem or you don't know what all is about. Children push parents away, due to not close or parents have no time for them and the worst-You don't understand me! So, schools teachers educate are very important, student meet their teachers 5 days per week and teaches face the student at least 5 to 6 hours per week, 20 to 30hours per month. A lot of parents spend less than 20 hours per month to talk to their children. Children with maids, grandparents, after school care or not with anyone, alone by themselves. They started to build their own mindset and attitude by what they can understand. Those who have misunderstood the truth fact will end up with the wrong track. To stop the children to end up in wrong track, we need to start the correct mindset and attitude learning as young as possible. My suggestion is between 6 to 8 years old to start with the simply correct information for mindset and how to have correct attitude. Schools and parents need to cooperate for this matter. In truth fact, a lot of teachers know the student better than student's parents. In future, I hope our society is in good mindset and attitude, and children turn out to what they dream.",Tan Puay Woie,0,2012-11-01 14:55:48
530837036945792_111685704,"It's admirable that Mr Tharman is able to understand the need for a ""real space"" so that our youths are able to learn how to think ""originally"" and critically about issues, and devise innovative solutions.

The government, however, needs to understand that it would be highly counterproductive if we were to create a space within the education system, yet not do so within broad society ‚Äì if in the general space, there are laws in place which prevent the ability to express freely and where certain issues are categorised as taboo, there is already structural impediments to what can be discussed ‚Äì there's self-regulation.

From a larger picture perspective, you want your youths to continue with the ability to have original and critical thinking abilities even after they leave the school system, and transit into the work system. In fact, it is of more value that they retain and expand on these abilities, especially in a knowledge economy, where such thinking abilities have a much more dire impact on the economy.

I urge the government to be bold. We cannot tell our youths to think openly and critically when there are rules in place outside of the school system which acts as countermeasures towards their thinking abilities. If there are still rules which prevent discussion against certain issues, such as race, religion and sexuality, how can we advance our critical thinking abilities in these areas, or other areas?

Of course, there are reasons for the government to want to impede on this a less controlled thinking environment ‚Äì the less critically people are able to think, the more they have a 'herd mentality' where they would follow whatever is said blindly, and the easier people are to control. Well, the government has to make a decision at this point ‚Äì how much do they want to continue to control and how much do they want to develop useful knowledge-based workers for the knowledge economy?

The government will undoubtedly still have OB markers in place, even if they create spaces within schools for ""original"" thinking. But the question is ‚Äì are rules the best way to manage people's thinking? Currently, the rules create a mentality of self-censorship. Is this what we want in the longer term? Self-censorship necessarily compromises on ""original"" and critical thinking abilities. We shut the thoughts out even before we can develop it further ‚Äì this will stunt our thinking abilities.

A stronger approach towards creating open and critical thinking abilities would be to educate and inculcate in people responsible thinking and speech, so that we will continue to be expansive in our thinking, yet be aware of how what we think or say will have an impact on others and then how we would put out what we say in a way that's honest, yet respectful and thoughtful towards others.

You put rules in place to prevent people from thinking and you create a society where there's underlying racism and discrimination, which we don't talk about because we've been told not to. You teach people to be responsible in their thinking abilities and you get them to think critically about these issues, such that it will move society towards a more aware and empathetic level.

There is a tight intertwining between our economic and social policies which are economically-inspired, and how these policies have a real impact on people's social behaviours, or lack thereof. If the government is sincere and truly empathetic on the need for Singaporeans to become more original and critical in their thinking, and more compassionate and kind towards one another, the government needs to understand how the broad structures that they have put in place over the years which allow for them to control effectively and to grow the economy can become counter-intuitive towards achieving a strong social fabric that ties society together.

At this juncture, the government needs to decide ‚Äì how much of control do they want to enact on people, and weigh it against how willing they are to let go of the control, towards enhancing the social and emotional well-being of the people? I would suggest that the government can relook their roles to be as facilitators to help create a thinking population which can think for themselves, and where the government aids in their thinking process. The government has shown signs that it's willing and wants to move in this direction. The question is also this ‚Äì the government cannot just think that they want to do things differently, but that they need to take down the structures which goes against their new thinking.

It's only as I look back so far the diff in my poly and current uni experience that I can to realise... Some CA modules have the lecturers to assess us based on presentation and essay, some by quiz and lab work etc. 

True that it's not so physcially felt at pri or sec school level...

No doubt it helps one to be made to learn how to write essay, how to handle presentation, it's still a 'test' after all.

520604507969045_113951560,"While we can appreciate the merits of NTUC taking swift action in an attempt to bring closure to this publicly contentious matter, one cannot help but wonder if the actions taken are in line with contemporary and accepted HR practices when it comes to handling matters of staff discipline, whereby warnings are issued for first time infractions and an outright termination, being a drastic decision, to be meted out to recalcitrant offenders.

Although the individual has to face up to the consequences of their actions, I wonder if the message put out by this move from the leading trade union in Singapore can have any long-term unintended consequences.

Notwithstanding any arguments on the basis of whether the punishment befits the offence proportionately, are we also putting out the message that an individual's right to gainful employment and a safe workplace environment is to be rendered subservient to the court of public opinion? If we allow such a mechanism to have a bearing on our general employment practices, then what of positions and offices that are by their very nature subjected to the forces of public opinion, such as political leadership and public servanthood? Where do we begin to draw the line, and how can we ensure that there are no double standards? Can we still continue to tout ourselves as a meritocracy when we hire or retain staffing based on their public popularity and not their capabilities?

Wielding the big stick so readily and heavily is also likely to send the message that ""one should keep one's racist views to oneself"" and drive other instances of such sentiments further underground, beyond the gauge of most known social barometers. The downside of this is that conversation and thought will then be stifled, while the brewing sentiments will continue to ferment, only to rear their heads in an unpredictable manner upon attaining critical mass. Do we really want this as a society heading into an increasingly uncertain future?

Have we as a society, amid the cheers and howls of applause at a fellow human being and a Singaporean who had just forfeited her means of livelihood over a momentary lapse of judgement, lost sight of an opportunity for a learning point to be had, that the same lapses can happen even to the best of us on a bad day? 

Some day, we all will have to recognise that fallibility is an integral part of the human condition, and that because of this fallibility we are all bound to have our own episodes of stupidity, with some episodes being more public than others. Unfortunately, going by how some quarters are weighing in on the issue and baying for blood as though they are paragons of virtue incarnate and incapable of the same human failings themselves, the arrival of that day is still but a distant hope.",Jarrod Luo,7,2012-10-08 15:30:55

If not wrong, S'pore is the only country that allows funeral wakes and weddings to be held at void decks or their homes. Visitors get shocked when they see it. Other countries only allow funerals to be held at funeral parlours. Imagine living on 2nd stories of HDB and more often funeral wakes than weddings are held below thus affecting residents who are not used to different types of religious chantings esp. at nights not forgetting that wakes can run through the whole week, minimum at least 4 days & 3 nights, some stretched to a week. HDB should build more multi-purpose halls to cater for such activities, and weddings could be held in Community Centre Halls. This way, it will not disturb the peace of residents esp when students are having exams, the sick need peaceful rests etc. The government should consider on how to solve such problems.

520604507969045_113971668,"1.	Yes, what amy cheong has posted is really something offensive & unacceptable.

2.If she look down/having misconception with the Malays, she could just go to mosques to tour around/going to HDB flats/Malay friend's wedding to learn more about them. This way, it will eventually give her a new life experience & remove the misconceptions in her mind.

I believe that people hating something/someone, is not because that they really hating them or something. Just that they don't understand about them, but once that they understand them, eventually all the hatred & everything will be eliminate. 

3.Yes, you can say that held weddings under the void deck seems to be cheap/low class. But you have to think again:

-Our HDB are now cost half of a million, isn't that will make our flats something the expensive/valuable, so how can we say that HDB is lousy/cheap/low class/poor people houses?

-Yes, held wedding at hotels or other places will eventually be the better alternative/more grand. While held weddings under the void decks is convenient, because your house is just above you only & also estate areas will have more people. Where your neighbours & friends will get the chance to see your wedding, wishing you or getting invited.

-You think that their wedding cost only $50?

-There are other factors that resulting our divorce rate.

-Many Malays are rich, many of them have cars.

4. It doesn't matter how grand or where you held your wedding at. As long both of you truly love each other, even if don't organize any wedding just by going to the ROM to register, both of you won't feel missing of anything, just want to live together for life & everyday being happy.

5.I don't think that the gov should jail or fire away people like her who made such racist comments (Because it seems to be a little bit too harsh. Yes, you all can say that racism is something definitely not allow in Singapore, if we never stop it. It may cause war or internal conflicts in our country. But yet at the same time, we shouldn't punish these people too heavily.). Maybe the authorities can make such people to do community work 100-1000 hours, fine them 1-5k, only jail them up if they were to make the mistake 3 times/too extreme & attending those religion classes on that particular religion that they insulted.

6. Our gov must know the difference between religious debate/discussion & insults. One is harmless, while the other is harmful. Harmful ones are like what amy cheong has posted. Religious debate/discussion is about people debating between religion, like introducing their religion to others or comparing the difference in teachings in other religion things like that.

Like what many people said, our racial harmony is something isn't that what we really say/see, we mostly just ignore about other people beliefs & their religions (We don't even really know what's the culture of other people races). While living a life of all our own, just without finding trouble with people of other races/mixing around with them that's all (You all tell me, how many friends of other races that you all have?).",Kah Kiat Tan,0,2012-10-13 00:46:40
520604507969045_113972595,"Being in a multi-racial country like S'pore, there are too many cultures we have to adapt to accommodate each sector without having to offend them publicly. Though much to our dislikes that we have to tolerate  as part & parcel of living in S'pore. At least twice if not 3 times a year, we have to bear with burning of papers causing air, dust and dirt pollution with burned paper ashes flying into homes and all over playgrounds and void decks & roads. Fortunately, these burnings have not caused human lives in order to call for a ban like what the government  did on banning of fire crackers during Chinese New Year cos too many ppl got hurt. Mind you, children seems to be enjoying burning joss papers and placing burning candles on passageways & roadsides together with parents & maids and what if these young kids get burned or passer-byers get burned while walking past. Who will they blame if such disasters do really happen one day? We always teach children not to play with fire but because of religion, parents never think about the safety of their kids.  Too fast & too often netizens sure point fingers at the government. Not easy to please every religion, culture or race but somehow someday we need to sacrifice for the sake of safety.

I'm sure we all have read a lot about the impressive achievements abt their builders who erected schools in Sichuan which collapsed like deck of cards & that proud longest bridge in Asia, which developed cracks within a year.
I believe anyone who has been moving around should have noticed the number of PRC construction companies.

That is why we need so many foreign workers to do the same work. Subcons employ 90% of workers on any jobsite. Maincons only employ about 10%. When you don't focus on the Subcons, you missed all the productivity opportunities. So why did the BCA neglect Subcons over 30 years? Because it is much easier. Maincons has association SCAL and Subcons are fragmented and disorganized. Therefore, to reduce foreign workers numbers, BCA needs to help Subcons get organized. BCA knew that, but they need more manpower because they themselves are understaffed and unable to attend to so many Subcons. So Minister Tharman, when we want to solve this problem, we need to go to roots. Help Subcons in big numbers and go deep into facilitating it. This job is very messy but necessary.

513127122050117_113905834,"Food for thoughts...

1. We can NEVER do without foreigners. Well, almost. Will Singaporean do the dirty job that they're doing? How many in current generation would be willing to work as cleaners / construction workers? Joshua and Azhar both made a point which many overlooked. Our education system has taught us to strive for white collar positions which offers either comfortable scope of work or substantial amount of salary because workers are normally not paid well. Even if they're not well-educated, only a minimum would go be construction workers. 

2. Foreign workers do not exactly earn less. Especially PRC workers in construction sites. You'll be shocked to see the payslip of skilled PRC workers. If Singaporean is willing to learn, they can still earn well and help minimise foreign workers issue. If our government can also consider giving subsidies to companies who employe Singaporeans as skilled workers, the cost of housing shouldn't be much of an issue. 

3. Productivity can only be achieved if a certain baseline is set (eg. minimum tender price, grading of project productivity (including subcontractor's manpower deployment), technologies / methods to improve site productivity etc). It's difficult to invest in technologies when tender prices are declining. BCA is giving subsidies, but how many employers are willing to fork out substantial amount of capital when they can rely on manual labour where they reap instant rewards? 

4. Instead of using levies and man-years to control number of foreign workers, why not restructure the allocation? Industries like construction and cleaning definitely need more foreign workers so they should be given more man-years and charged with lesser levies whereby lesser man-years and higher levies should be given to other industries until there's an increase of Singaporeans working in the former industries.

5. To limit the amount of ""foreign"" Singapore citizens and Singapore PR, we can impose more stringent conditions such as studying in Singapore for >10yrs and serving NS like what most Singaporeans are 'tasked' to fulfil before considering foreigners to convert into Singapore citizens or PR.

Things cannot be changed in the short future but if we explore the above suggestions, we may find a solution to our problems in years to come (cross fingers it's sooner than later).

513127122050117_113942005,"Raising productivity is the key. Raising wage is not.

If we want to help low wage workers (LWW), can we just raise the wage of the workers in the Construction Industry alone? The answer is no. So to be fair, we will also have to raise the wage of cleaners, production operators, bus drivers, security officers, etc etc. The businesses which use the services of these LWW will then pass the cost on to the consumers. Inflation will then follow. Some may suggest the government subsidize these wage increase. Where then can the government get the money to do so? One way is from our reserves. Do we want that? No. Thus, the other way is from the taxpayers. Then Singaporeans will pay higher taxes. Businesses will pay higher taxes. Then Singapore will no longer be competitive. What will happen to Singapore next?

However, if the workers' productivity is increased, it is a different matter. There will be no increase in cost to the consumers because businesses will be able to accomplish the same job with less workers.",Kenneth Koh,3,2012-10-06 14:18:38
513127122050117_113942010,"Do we want to encourage Singaporeans to go into the Construction Industry? Yes, but only certain areas. Only in the areas where the skill can carry the worker till retirement age. Construction is a tough job. Very manual and physical. When construction workers get to the age of 40+, they may not be able to take the toughness and physical demands anymore. Hence, We will then be left with a group of workers who are skilled but cannot get a job because of fitness reasons. Re-deploy these workers will be a problem. So, it is not wise to encourage the young to be construction workers even if the pay is $5000/month - unless they can move up the management ladder.

To my mind, these tough jobs should be left to the young foreign workers who can always be replaced when they get too old for the jobs. 

We need foreigners to help build our HDB flats, work in our shipyards, and do our city cleaning. There is no running away.

(Yes, I understand in developed countries, many of these jobs are paid well. But it doesn't mean that we have to follow whatever they do. Some of these countries provide for unemployment benefits.

We can expect many Singaporeans to voice their ideas in the coming months.
This morning 16th Feb 2013 ST's Life has an article ""The rocky road to future growth"", and Workers' Party's letter in ST Forum: ""WP's position on foreign workers has been consistent"".
We can only expect the 'public mass protest' this afternoon at Hong Lim Park's Speakers' Corner will be boisterous in rejecting the White Paper in total. However, I hope the speakers and aspiring politicians will put forth sound and solid suggestions as well.
In the months to come, there will be many suggestions but will the Govt really listen to the good ideas and take it into consideration and deliberate on it decisively?
2013 to 2030 ‚Äì 17 years
We can expect many senior politicians in Singapore will retire or pass on within these 17 years.
It will be the same in Indonesia and Malaysia.
Will the younger politicians of these 3 countries build up close rapport with confidence and trust among themselves free of past political emotional baggage to plan ahead?
What should they do in the coming years looking forward at what do they want to achieve when they are in charge?
They might not agree on all things geo-politics but surely they can take steps to plan ahead in areas of economics and development to counter the threats for investments and jobs that could go to big countries like China and India.
From economics and development there would be more to share and less hungry people. There will be a better chance for their countries to be politically stable and free of turmoil and mass uprising.
What are the threats economically and what should be done within these 17 years?
Iskandar Shah in Johor and the Bataam and Bintan Islands in Indonesia are potentials to counter the threats for jobs and investments flowing towards China and India.
Will there be plans to make these places into future economic hubs thriving with activities and growth?
To achieve this will need lots of investments, capital and good infrastructures to make the connections for easy access to Singapore.
Where can Singapore fit in and what is in it that will make it win-win for all 3 countries?
Singapore has projected to grow its population to 6.9m by 2030.
Rather than allow in foreigners from far away countries, people who are not familiar with our culture in South-East Asia, it would be better for Singapore to look at Malaysia and Indonesia as the traditional sources to fill the gap in our labour force.
To house a bigger population will mean building 700,000 residential units. If we take an average of $100,000 in construction cost, it would mean investing $70bn in 17 years in housing.
Housing a bigger population by investing $70bn. Are there other alternatives?
We can look North or South for the alternatives.
If the foreign workers coming from Malaysia and Indonesia could reside there, and commute to Singapore to work, it would free the massive congestion that could be expected when the population reaches 6.5m or more in Singapore.
I hope the younger politicians of these 3 countries will work together to plan ahead on this for mutual benefits.
A] There is a need of a MRT rail line to connect Singapore to Johor. If we cannot reclaim land on both sides of the Causeway to widen it, I hope land could be reclaimed to build the MRT line [tunnels under the Johor Straits will be expensive] with provisions for a future Rapid Rail to connect Singapore to Iskandar Shah and Kuala Lumpur. The MRT line to Johor will mean developments in many economic activities other than housing in Southern Johor. It will free Singapore from massive congestion with a huge population. Instead of pumping $70b in 700,000 units of housing, I hope the Singapore Govt will work with the Malaysian/Johor Govt on this project with a timeline of 10 to 17 years to see it materialize.
B] If the younger politicians of Indonesia could work with their Singapore counterparts, there could be a plan among them to build a tunnel/expressway/MRT rail connection from Singapore to Batam/Bintan. This idea was mooted some 20 years ago but has not been forgotten by both sides as it has been kept in abeyance. It would mean opportunities in many social activities not just economics when the physical connections are built. Some of the $70bn could be deployed to build these physical infrastructures for workers from Indonesia to have residence in these 2 islands but find employment in Singapore. It would free Singapore from massive people congestion when the population grows to above 6.5m by 2030.
C] If the physical connections in A and B are built, it would mean retirees might find it easier to commute and stay in Johor or these 2 Indonesian islands. It would relieve congestion of people in Singapore and bring more economic activities to Johor, Batam and Bintan.",Tan Kok Tim,0,2013-02-16 12:51:40

If you look closely in the education system, it provides a platform for our local students to have a foothold on the international stage. It is up to our local students to strive for more and be hungry to succeed. Looking beyond our shores and gain experience to compete locally and international. 

Education is a stepping stone. we have to realise that EXPERIENCE plays an important role in any career. Bargaining power is created and perceived to be higher for foreigners but what made you think that way? It is the mindset that is entrenched that our Singaporeans' mind that we are losing out in the competition.

But I've not forgotten the fact that our education system has yet to nuture us fully... it's way too academic without getting us to think critically, look at things differently and more importantly, progressing students in a steady manner...

My study life was never steady... It was full of hiccups and by the time in uni 3rd yr last yr, I'd to give up taking the exams because I realised it's really to the extent that I wonder just what did I really learn in NTU... By now, it's not that I never tried, but it's that the pace was too fast and I was not properly prep up for the expectation... Neither was it that I didn't sound off the alarm, regrettably no one understood my problems until I really didn't take the exam which I'd alrdy signalled to the admin staff the very intention to do so at the going rate...

I guess they must have thought no one would dare to take the risk of getting a F reflected on the transcript... But am I going to take into such threats for which I may go into mental breakdown for taking the paper and looking at the qn? Is it worth it? Though I must say it was avoidable had people took action earlier... 

I guess for that semester, I may be well known... for being the student that didn't even attend the exam without any MC or whatever in so many years... Least it's known that I mean it for what I say to the NTU admin staff... 

In fact I'd noticed this... It's my personal pov though... a lot of the standards were artifically inflated, I'm referring to how the lectures was conducted [lecturers that didn't really teach, expecting you to self study entirely] and how the exam paper are set...

But a speech is made up of words. Without words, there is not action. As we speak, actions are being formulated and let's wait and see if the results can speak for itself.

Much have been said about the $1000/mth income. But I believe many of us have heard of and seen with our own eyes, how some families do not earn much but could still get by. Parking attendants - $1500/mth, living in a 3-room flat with 2 or more kids. Cleaners, $900/mth, living in a 2-room flat. Retirees, BTO studio apartments, etc..................I am quite sure the above don't happen in many place. Likely only in Singapore. Even in Hong Kong, there are people who live in the street. In Taiwan and South Korea, the young cannot afford their own flat. A case of ""I felt sorry for myself because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no feet.""?

503244793038350_111531134,"Well said! But our education system, though it has improved a lot from what it was during my time, still pays staunch emphasis on academic achievement. Parents scramble to get their kids up on the academic ladder topped with a pile of other kinds of stress to be an all rounder, when the child doesnt want it. In many ways, the environment also creates this kind of pressure from the parents as competition is steep. Afterall, the idea that being a scholar guarantees one's ultimate success. In my opinion, the person creates the journey. You observe the environment and modify your methods along the way. How good and vibrant the outcome will be determined by one's intelligence, perseverence and creativity. The type that knows no boundaries to succeed and the type who shows sheer guts to knock down people or walls that come in front of them. However, there are crazy times when things don't work out somewhat. The reset and restart can be tedious. And no matter how tough the person is, it is time spent and gone. It cannot be taken back. Whilst some obstacles are understandable and self inflicted, some may be man made and should not be there in the first place. For some individuals, talent and gift may not come that soon. But they may have suffered from academic failure or lackluster grades at some point when they were young. But that doesn't imply they are unintelligent. But our system still appears to pin the past more than what these people have gone through and achieved. Personally, I have learnt far more from these so called non-elites than I learnt from anyone in the top tier of the academic cirlcle.  Because their life paths are less smooth, they pick up way more knowledge than those who think they know it all. Complacency and ego can degarde even the brightest. In many ways, the best leaders may not come from those smooth sailing academic high fliers. It is those who have fought it through, and learn humbly from all people of all walks of life that makes a leader. I sure hope that our system does not deprive people, whatever their age, creed or background from a chance to shine. There is simply only one life to live. No one likes to get blundered. For some laziness and unmotivated thoughts are the cause for failure. But for a good number, I think they deserve a chance.",Karen Fu,2,2012-08-28 15:17:09

502629899766506_113778176,"@Troy - I don't think the poll is biased in anyway. It is a simple and straightforward question and it is open to all.

There are few points I want to make:

(a) Anger is against PAP's immigration policy and not against foreigners.  Of course some people exhibit bad behaviour but most of criticism online is against Government's policies. It is very smart and cunning on the part of PAP leadership to make it appear as vitrol against foreigners - it is not.

(b) The way PAP conducted itself during Hougang BE2012 hasn't set any good standard for PAP to preach to Singaporeans. PAP top leadership indulged in character assassination during the by-election which I thought was most ungracious thing to do.

(c) Lack of free mainstream media means the views that we hear in mainstream media is not reflective of actual ground sentiments.

I agree with Zhang Weihuang that anger is manifested as a result of years of forced tolerance and frustrations.

Singapore born Singaporeans are minority in their own country (check http://bit.ly/ipssg001).  Rather than disclosing information fully and in transparent manner, information is being suppressed.

Lastly I think Government really needs to trust and let go (http://bit.ly/ipssg002).

On one hand Government says competition is unavoidable for citizens (which everyone agrees) but when it comes to themselves, PAP indulges in shameless political gerrymandering (e.g. GRC, constant redrawing of electoral boundaries, lack of independent election commission, misuse of PA for political purpose etc.) to avoid competition at all costs.

This is not acceptable for many people. The sooner PAP understand and accepts it - better it will be.",Jack Lam,5,2012-08-29 01:41:38

Quote

The more attractive Singapore is in luring massive droves of foreigners here, the more unattractive it risks becoming for Singaporeans. Our country now feels like a crowded hotel where people come and go. Singaporeans wonder what is the use of chalking up economic numbers by importing so many foreigners? Singapore and Singaporeans become two different words. Singaporeans are not against foreigners but many feel forsaken and this is what we need to address.

2) We're not anti-foreigners as long as they add necessary value
3) We're not anti-immigration

What we want is a fair opportunity to lead a life as a Singaporean in Singapore & be proud of what we've achieved. What we want is a safe & secure environment to raise a family & kids. We understand that the competition is global these days, but we will differentiate & compete effectively to create economic value. We want space & balance in life...and not everything is a statistic digit.

Give us room to grow, explore, experiment. Don't crowd us out. Let those who deserve come in, and don't do immigration indiscriminately. We're angry because the influx was very quick & with little warning. Treat us, your electorate with your heart, not with your wallets. The anger stems from your policies & when we react negatively, its now our fault? Granted, we've never been that gracious or have an entirely open spirit.  Much of that can be attributed to the way we were brought up...home & school...coz its indoctrinated in us from an early age.  We've always been told to listen, toe the line & conform, leaving us little room to express ourselves until social media arrived at the scene.  

I think the govt is very well aware of the real feelings on the ground & much of the content/messages delivered these days are to smooth these feelings over.  Its a start, but the reality is that the govt needs to win over hearts & minds again & start to re-earn the trust that the electorate entrusted on them many years ago.  But pls pls pls, don't chide us citizens in broad brushstrokes.  U have to understand that there'll always be a few outliers.  U must also understand that your policies are the root causes of this anger & mistrust.  We understand that refining these policies take time, but pls don't take too much time.

In conclusion, if the govt is the parent, the electorate (the children) has grown up & its time to treat them as adults & not children.  Thanks.

He also went on to report that his Indian IT Manager only engaged outsourced under-qualified SAP consultants for the MNC he worked for from his own ""secret"" external IT company. It was done without the knowledge of the MNC, resulting in conflict of interest. Moreover, the same IT Manager only employed all native comrades from India. As there is no quota for PRs/EP holders, such disturbing trends could be observed in certain companies if the hiring managers are not a Singaporeans and it is challenging to enforce against such outright discrimination. Another local MNC bypass the SPass quota to hire more Foreign IT staff directly at a lower cost by engaging outsourced companies. Maybe, MOM could data mine such disturbing trends or probable discrimination in certain companies if it does not lump PR and Singaporeans together. Are these IT jobs shun by Singaporean IT PME? I doubt so. Hope that govt authorities consider quota for PR/EP holders in companies. We might need FW in jobs that Singaporeans shun, but we definitely do not need too many PRs/FT that would marginalize Singaporean PMEs in the employment process. We welcome those really qualified & sincere FT/PRs who are keen to integrate into our society, abide by Singapore law and practices Fair Employment based on Merit regardless of race or caste, and are willing to take up the National Services obligations for their 2nd generation PRs.

502629899766506_113803082,"Dear Sir, certain individual policies from different ministries might have indirectly discourage or deter more Singaporeans to have more children. Hope that the  different govt division policy makers could collaborate closely to derive more down-to-earth & holistic policies that are applicable to all common Singaporeans. It would definitely help if the elite policy makers/consultants (Various levels) could regularly ""walk the talk"" personally to ensure that any policies are relevant, fair, realistic & beneficial to the common Singaporeans generally.
For a higher Singaporeans birth rate, the areas for the govt to focus and to improve are:
1) High HDB price for first timers. Couples start family much later to save more money 1st. Not many first timers have rich parent to help financially.
2) High infant/childcare fees and high healthcare fees for children. Thus, number of children per family would be limited.
3) Lack of reliable & baby/toddler friendly public transport. Overcrowded public transport is definitely not suitable for families with babies/Toddlers. Private school buses keep increasing fees and has fixed pickup time.
4) COE too high for middle income families planning to have more children and where the car is a basic necessity to fetch babies/toddlers to & from childcare centre during limited operating hours and then to reach office promptly. Not all affordable childcare cntr are near the parent's offices/home. There should be a limit to the cars per household, regardless of the social class status(Income group). Similar to property tax, govt should consider imposing much higher tax levy for the 2nd car and 3rd car ownership per household. Moreover,  the govt should avoid having high COE creating an undesirable prominent social class division in Singapore subsequently. Vehicle population could be control by alternative means and should not compromise the crucial objectives for higher Singaporeans birth rate.
5) High tertiary fees and other increasing education costs is quite challenging for lower/middle Singaporean family. More Subsidies, Bursaries and scholarships to be provided to Singaporeans instead of foreign students(PRs). Suggestion for some tertiary Singaporean students to take ""stressful"" study loan from bank/organization might not be the best Viable option. Please review and ensure really more affordable tertiary education for all Singaporeans. Longer study loan servicing period implies much longer time to start saving money to start a family and have children.
6) Review & further tighten employment controls/numbers on PRs/EP holders in every companies to minimize discrimination against Capable Singaporean PMEs. Singaporeans must be gainfully employed and not underemployed to support a family with children  properly in the long run. Pls review job discrimination against capable Singaporean PMEs who are 40 years old & above too.  In short, Pls consider Job security for Singaporeans 1st which would be key considerations prior to long term family planning.
7) Determine whether High Inflation is partly due to excessive PRs/""FT"" in overcrowded space constraint Singapore. Consider more affordable healthcare with more subsidies for Singaporeans children. Further healthcare subsidies reduction for non-Singaporeans.
8) Improve safety on the road, especially for vulnerable toddlers & children. Strict enforcement of Road Traffic Act on errant cyclists speeding recklessly on pedestrian footpath/crossing endangering road users especially those families walking with their babies/toddlers.

I think various policies and schemes are created to help families with employment (full-time) and also take care of their other immediate concerns like housing, schooling and elder care. 

In which way did the government inflict wounds on the people? 
If you have notice cases that need assistance (e.g. picking up cardboards and others), go to them and ask if they need help. 

I have seen and called the Comcare hotline and someone is readily available to provide assistance whether if they are homeless or in crisis. Heard on the radio that there is even COMCARE.SG that you visit to find the necessary assistance for those elderly.

I agree very much on the need for a culture. However, developing a culture carries a lot of personal involvement (personal diligence and commitment for one to develop it in himself) in addition to government encouragement through appropriate policies. Excellence in arts, letters, manners, scholarly pursuits, etc. cannot succeed just by government alone. Citizens must learn to collaborate (cooperate) with the government and the latter must learn to accept some messiness with a tolerance of mistakes. If we want greater government tolerance of citizens, the latter must surely reciprocate with their tolerance of the resulting degree of messiness and mistakes whether by

With the current prices of $500,000 for a 4 room flat, how can they afford, and the fear of losing their jobs and wanting kids. How do they cope? Please help the new generation find reasons to stay in Singapore and procreate, by cutting prices of new flats to around $200,000. As a current flat owner, I do not mind having a paper loss on my flat if my future children can afford new flats at adfordable prices. Make it cost plus, not market value with discount model.

I think in today's era, the Internet has freed all peoples of different creed. It is a free world because the Internet is free.

499542180075278_111510612,"@ William, it is the mindset that matters when deciding whether to have children - in terms of whether one sees children as bringing joy, an important part of a family - a happy family, or simply as burden - emotional or financial. The various incentives are important as these do facilitate the decision, but unlikely to be the tilting or determining factors. Likewise, about getting married - though other factors are at play e.g. getting hitched. I have been sharing with many leaders I met that they ought to do more to shape people's mindset with regards to getting married and having children, and it has to start early. This is an emotive issue that cannot be simply addressed through financial incentives.",Opt Prime,0,2012-08-20 03:35:08

These young men are all in their early 40s and even Lawrence Wong is only 39.  My issue, is that no Malay or Indian young men is in the fore front for the race to be our next PM.    There are more than enough talented young men, whom are local born Indian and even Malays. At least let them have a chance. Bring a few in to run against Chan Chun Seng, Tan Chuang Jin and Lawrence Wong.    Why are they all only Chinese ?

Dear DPM Tharman Shanmugaratnam 

I am impressed with the manner that you have answered blogger Roy Ngerng's barrage of questions on CPF related issues at the recent Forum on CPF and Retirement Adequacy, organised by think tank Institute of Policy Study (IPS). 

You have answered eloquently and in a manner that is transparent and non-evasive.

I am very proud to have you as our leader and certainly believe you would make a great Prime Minister succeeding PM Lee Hsien Loong.

You has made us Singaporeans proud in your sterling and admirable performance since your appointment as the Chairman of the International Monetary and Financial Committee, the policy steering committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 

I hope to be connected with you on Facebook. .

Thank you and look forward to hear from you.
