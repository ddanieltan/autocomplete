1230301650325837_1232735230082479,"Hi Kenny and Yeon Ja, thanks for bringing this up. We're aware of the technical glitch during the GCE Listening Comprehension. It happened at the start of the broadcast for 17 seconds and the rest of the 45-min examination continued smoothly. At its conclusion, Symphony 92.4FM repeated the affected passage so that students could listen to it again. We'd like to apologize again for the technical issues on radio this week and we sincerely hope to seek your kind understanding on this matter.",Mediacorp,1,2016-11-01 02:04:24

856935391109550_857039351099154,"It is indeed a very interesting and informative drama. 美中不足的是。。。TOO MANY ADVERTISEMENTS in between the 30 minutes screening. Most advertisements do not relate to the drama at all!!! In my opinion, just a 30 seconds advertisement (something that is related to the drama)would be enough. A 30 min screening is already very short and if you add in sooooooo many advertisements,  the whole screen time is probably around 20 minutes. This is something which I really hope Mediacorp will sit up and acknowledge every feedbacks about the amount of advertisements you slot in between every drama screenings. So if you ask me if I'll watch it next time if they make part two...I won't. But I'll definitely watch next week's episode coz our favourite MP, Mr Chee Hong Tat will be singing in that episode ☺",Seabreeze Love,0,2016-10-14 15:02:47

男上司为了让美黛接受乃祎而提出这个观点，但美黛也马上反对了他的言论，清楚地说明女性穿内衣并不是为了取悦男性。这场戏是为了带出不同性别对这个课题的偏见而设计的，并非刻意贬低女性的地位。

《来自水星的男人》述说的是男性在所谓""女性""行业里所面对的挑战，也探讨两性对彼此持有的偏见。因此，剧中的人物和剧情会围绕这个中心思想而设计。 最后，剧中的人物都会发现并纠正自己错误的偏见，更加尊重并体谅彼此。

Reflecting back, 10 years ago, I was an avid EPL fan. Followed almost every games that was telecasted live, and it could be as many as 5 games over 1 weekend. I was passionate!
Then competition set in between the telcos and prices shot up. I decided to stop the subscription in protest. Initially, I suffered from withdrawal syndrome, trying hard to look for free to air channels over the net, and still followed the results closely every weekend.
Slowly, my passion dimmed a little by little. Started with too lazy to look out for free channel in the web, just reading the results over the weekend. Then as I slept early, and have new found hobby, i had totally weaned myself off soccer to the extend.... Who won the European Cup? 
My children dont watch soccer too, because i dont subscribe anymore. Somehow, sport bodies need to realise, this thing about profitability cannot carry on at such exorbitant rate. The support base will get smaller and passion will die.",Pang MH,16,2016-08-05 04:16:56

1138672529488750_1140200716002598,"Hi Kartik,

Thank you for your feedback on our broadcast of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. 

The programme was prepared for broadcast with a general audience in mind, where strong scenes like the knifing of a python and the eating of live snakes and monkey brains may be deemed inappropriate for some of our more sensitive viewers watching the movie.

Nonetheless, we value your views, and shall explore the possibility of relying more on consumer warning advisories so as to preserve such graphic depictions in our programmes.

We appreciate your comments and the opportunity to clarify.",Mediacorp Channel 5,0,2016-07-04 07:40:26
1138672529488750_1140204276002242,"If it's too sensitive then movies such as this should not be aired at all. What's the point of airing these movies with elements which make the movie memorable taken out? Like what you had stated in your reply above, I warning would be appropriate so that sensitive viewers could choose not to watch at all, this would be more logical solution rather than having a blanket ban on everything. 

Furthermore, I believe similar scenes can be viewed in channels such as Nat Geo. So I think what you are doing is just overkill. You have to understand the fact that there are other viewers also, rather than the only the sensitive types so a one-size-fits-all approach does not work here. 

Considering the number of awards you have won as broadcaster of the year etc... I was under the impression of you knowing the needs of your audience. I hope changes can be made.",Kartik Aravind Raj Selvarajah,1,2016-07-04 07:51:52

10153715988695838_10153718008880838,"Hi Harry,

We refer to The Vales commercial on Channel 5, specifically the strong interest surrounding the advertisement being in Mandarin. 

While Channel 5, from a programming perspective, is positioned as an English language platform, current guidelines on commercials carried on the channel however, bear little restrictions on language. 

However, as audience inclusiveness and mass exposure of the commercials strongly benefit both viewers and the advertisers, Mediacorp will look into engaging with our advertorial clients to consider creative opportunities to make our non-English language commercials accessible to everyone.

We are very grateful for the candid feedback, and appreciate the opportunity to bring clarity on the matter.",Mediacorp,0,2016-05-18 02:45:01

What is the meaning of the ad which shows a foreign couple being so in love and later she fell out of love/passion with him. Maybe, you should get more relevant story boards and not do to your own understanding. You still have not explained what were the meaning (not important?) and the relevancy of your ads and what you hoped to achieve. Looks like you did not achieve it as you are looking for new ideas.

SINGAPORE — Officers from various Government agencies will come together to form teams to develop more than 20 selected economic sectors under the S$4.5 billion Industry Transformation Programme, which was unveiled in last week's Budget.

The officers will come from agencies such as the Economic Development Board, SPRING, IE Singapore, A*STAR and Workforce Development Agency. They are tasked to lead industries ranging from logistics and precision engineering to tourism and retail in charting their respective transformation roadmaps.   ..................",Tan Kok Tim,0,2016-03-28 23:45:02

10153895772993971_10153898300528971,"Hi, This animated series is a China production. The story is set in the 1930s after the Chinese Civil War and focuses on  the character Xiao Song and his auntie who sells pastries for a living. Through the depictions of Xiao Song's interactions with his classmates, villagers and fellow hawkers, the cartoon attempts to educate young viewers with good values of kindness, honesty, thriftiness, filial piety and more. The cartoon series is highly approved of by the authorities in China. It has won several awards in China and shown during prime-time on CCTV. 

With regard to the context of the scene, it would not have been possible to edit out the smoking character and still retain a meaningful flow and continuity of the story. 

The smoking character, though undesirable, is crucial as the story integrity is at stake, but it does not encourage or glamourise smoking. There was an educational point to the scene.  

At the same time, we do understand your point in the context of present day values and concerns. As such, we have a practice of editing out such scenes where possible, even in adult programmes. If not possible, we will recommend against buying such programmes if we have the opportunity to pre-vet a programme before purchase is made.  

For those who are interested in the context of the scene in the cartoon: 
A villager is brought before a police officer for suspected theft of a ginseng. The owner of a medicinal hall had been selling fake ginseng and the suspect had, in fact, stolen a carrot rather than ginseng. The owner of the medicinal hall is subsequently ordered by the police officer to pay for the medical treatment needed by the suspect's ailing son. The scene is crucial as it reveals the medicinal hall owner to be dishonest.

Hope this explanation, albeit lengthy, would provide a satisfactory answer to your concerns.",Mediacorp,0,2016-03-07 06:34:09

10154059432148304_10154061349318304,"Hi guys

An Ang Mo writing from Germany. 

I used to live in Singapore for four years and really loved it.  
In my oppinion Singapore is one of the best and most pleasant spots to live in the world. 

Everyone thinks that Germans are correct liable and always in time but Singaporeans are beating us in each of this point 😉

While I was in Singapore I was forced to be an Expat wife 😉.  
No work permit for gay civil partners.   That was very sad to realize  and was difficult to explain to my German friends. 
But I don't want to talk about the gay issue but about censorship. 

I had a lot of time to read and get to know Singapore a little better. 
One of the books was From Third world to First of Mr Lee. 
Since that I have the greatest respect of what he achieved for the little spot Singapore. 
Living together in a multicultural society provides many difficulties. 
In Germany there is a big discussion going on because of the refugee issue you might have heard of. 

When Mr Lee came in power 1965 Singapore was not just poor financially but also in education. 
That has changed dramatically in both ways. 
Singapore grew up. 

Here is my critics towards the current government.

I got to know the Singaporeans as very open self-conscious independent thinkers but also a little conservative. 

However in my oppinion the government treats the people still a little bit too much like children nowadays. 

The more educated Singaporeans get the more they find out about this fact.  It causes more and more questions about how they want to be treated. 

A monopolized media industry that censores is not showing the reality of the world.  The system treats its citizens like children need to be protected.

In times of Internet where everyone can see what really happens this causes more and more discontent. 

In my opinion this needs to be changed urgently because this is no longer appropriate.

I hope the Singapore government this will quickly see.

Sorry about my bad English.",Oliver Eiber,22,2016-02-24 08:30:03

10154059432148304_10154062460898304,"J.j. Fong  I totally agree with your sentiments  - as a boy who spent the ages of 12 to 16 in Singapore, my experience of growing up gay over 30 years ago in Singaporean society was pretty traumatising in retrospect- people like me were invisible and the attitudes of most towards homosexuality were hostile. At one level it was a very lonely and isolating time and a period of inauthenticity. I didn't deserve that. Openness and positive LGBT role models in the media have a net healthy effect on society. It's great to see such different attitudes on most of the responses in the feed - perhaps the censors are out of step with the more open attitudes of Singaporean society. The people who are being harmed today are those lonely isolated LGBT children  - 30 years on I know they definitely deserve better. These kids are your brother , sister , cousin, pupil, friend .... They aren't a toxic enemy but human beings that need acceptance, love and  to know they are not alone.",Mark Rohan Pakianathan,2,2016-02-24 18:44:19

Check your antenna and receiver connections

Check that the UHF antenna is connected to the antenna input of your digital receiver. If you are using an active antenna, make sure that the antenna power supply is available. Refer to the owner's manuals of your antenna and receiver if you are unsure of the proper connections.  

Adjust your antenna, if needed

Placing the indoor antennas on top or at the side of the TV may not be the best location. If you have trouble with digital TV reception, please try moving the antenna: 

Near a window, away from area whereby the signal may be block 
Position the antenna higher 
Away from other electronic equipment such as computers, DVD players, the HDMI cable and the television itself 
•       You may need a longer connecting cable to place the antenna for optimal reception.

•       You may use the signal strength/quality indicator of your receiver to assist you while adjusting your antenna.",Mediacorp,0,2015-12-24 01:16:06

If I move the antenna slightly away from the window, the signal is lost. Hougang is definitely not ""indoor reception ready"" as claimed on your website.

At even the very sexualized AMAs, he managed to shock the audience by thrusting one of his dancer's face into his crotch. That's stimulated oral sex. Like what... It's downright wrong for a stage performance.

This is disappointing especially since I used to listen to his music when he first appeared on American idol and the beat for Ghost town was not bad.

You must have heard about last thursdays events and the causes of the decision of the Swiss National bank. This day will be one of those ""black"" days in the History of the exchanges, since billions of investment money was venished in short hours ( FXCM, Alpari, Global Brokers, Excel Markets CLOSED ON THE EDGE ).
The clients of 5Gulden must have heard this only from the news and not from their trading accounts. 
This is because of the constant innovations, high quality maintanance and manual controll of our High Frequency Trading system.
On this Thursday 5Gulden clients were not loosing any money, they made an exceptional profit. 
The system realized the volatile situation and instantly changed to trade only on the Dax index (DE30).
We are also very proud of our broker partner, 3TG Brokers who had no affect what so ever from these critical market moves, this is because of their professional risk management. They could handle the causes of the extreme market moves and could benefit from them.

You must have heard about last thursdays events and the causes of the decision of the Swiss National bank. This day will be one of those ""black"" days in the History of the exchanges, since billions of investment money was venished in short hours ( FXCM, Alpari, Global Brokers, Excel Markets CLOSED ON THE EDGE ).
The clients of 5Gulden must have heard this only from the news and not from their trading accounts. 
This is because of the constant innovations, high quality maintanance and manual controll of our High Frequency Trading system.
On this Thursday 5Gulden clients were not loosing any money, they made an exceptional profit. 
The system realized the volatile situation and instantly changed to trade only on the Dax index (DE30).
We are also very proud of our broker partner, 3TG Brokers who had no affect what so ever from these critical market moves, this is because of their professional risk management. They could handle the causes of the extreme market moves and could benefit from them.

That's a five year window! I don't even know when I should be in a hurry to go purchase new hardware. The FAQ also doesn't mention when the existing DVB-T signals will be switched off.

Somebody has to guide you through daily life aspects, to show you the intricate details of how a society operates,  to instill you the norms and values that make you a part of a new community.

This is what the TODAY newsletter has done for me.

Regarding the issue, entertainment news is part of our coverage on News 5 Tonight, and kept to the end of the bulletin which usually finishes on a lighter note.

In this case, the story you mentioned was a minute-long piece, which gave a snapshot of how some top celebrities planned to spend Valentine's Day - including Golden Globe winner Anne Hathaway choosing to devote her day to a good cause by taking part in the global One Billion Rising campaign targeting violence against women.

We hope this clarifies, and thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. If you have further queries, do drop us an email at: tellmediacorp@mediacorp.com.sg. Have a good weekend!",Mediacorp,0,2013-02-15 10:00:43

486217841400892_5693201,"Hi Gordon, thank you for your feedback.

Regarding the issue, Channel 5 was scheduled to carry the Barclays Singapore Open and the FINA/ARENA Swimming World Cup yesterday.

As the Barclays Singapore Open over ran by some 2 hours and Channel 5 was pre-committed to broadcast FINA/ARENA Swimming World Cup LIVE at 6pm, it was unfortunately not able to broadcast the final moments of Barclays Singapore Open. Updated results and the playoff between winner Italian Matteo Manassero and South African Louis Oosthuizen was shown later during News 5 Tonight and replayed at 12am. 

Channel 5 would like to explain that the conflicting live sports coverage resulted in the split-timing decision to switch to swimming at 6pm and apologises for upsetting its golf viewers.",Mediacorp,0,2012-11-12 02:55:32

I study 9 hours a day on the 3rd floor of my house with nothing to accompany me but an ipod, earphones, some energy bars and an old radio. Those old radios from the 1980s. On the first day of my revision, I was bored after a few hours and decided to turn on that radio. I switched the radio channel to 987FM and its was playing payphone. I started to listen and kinda got hooked to the song. I was surprised myself. I'd normally listen to hard rock and heavy metal but I love other kinds of emotional music, lyrics and all....so anyway, back to the topic. Mediacorp has changed my life by entertaining me and giving me a great laugh when i'm down. I love listening to 987FM's 'The Men Show' on Sunday afternoons and 'Music with Divian and Jaqcui' at night. Well.....I can say that mediacorp has been there for me, in a way.

I dare say that radio has been a small source of consolation during all this time. She enjoyed listening to 92.4 in the evenings and as she was going to sleep in her last days and I enjoy listening to both 92.4 and 90.5 during the days and evenings - it helps fill the silence of the days and nights which is now so empty without her and brings back memories of the music we loved and shared.   Thanks Mediacorp.,Anthony Chew,16,2012-06-14 06:36:55

395917373788439_4593088,"Our family is always tuned in to Gold90.  Radio is on throughout the whole day.  

2 years ago, my son (then 3yo) was hospitalised for a very high fever.  He went into a fever fit and was hospitalised for 5 days.  It was really trying and heartbreaking for us as parents to see him on drips, constantly taking meds, sponging him day and night, waiting for results, sleepless nights etc.  It was so physically and emotionally draining.  

I am thankful that Gold was always with us throughout the hospital stay.  My phone was tuned into Gold.  That provided some entertainment and joy to us as we ploughed through the ordeal.  The DJs and the songs made us feel happier and helped preserve our sanity! :) 

During one of the nights after he was discharged, as my husband and I were lamenting about the huge bill and how exhausted we were, we were so blessed when we heard Tim Oh played one of our fav songs ""Rainbow Connection"".  It was our courtship song. :)  Just when we needed a jab to lift up our spirits, we got it from the radio! We just simply sat there and basked in the beautiful melody of the song.  The song refreshed our tired spirits and definitely brought smiles to our tired faces.  

Rainbows appear after stroms.  It is a beautiful sign that says 'Things are normal again'.  And yes, the worst of the storm was over.  Surely it was 'rainbow time' that followed.",Carol Lim,2,2012-07-05 08:05:54

395917373788439_4595858,Ameen Sayani presenting Binaca Geet Mala is my earliest memory from Radio. I think it was broadcast of Shortwave by Radio Ceylon.
