If we may share, for every set of crew that we deploy, there is a flight time limitation for their duty beyond which it would not be advisable for them to continue with their duty, due to fatigue.

An announcement that we were going to stopover in KL was made about an hour before we landed. Some time before that, I had noticed that the flight status showed us going to KL. Then this letter comes after we land in KL but was prepared by the SM in Dubai. 

When the situation is bad, information coming in dribs and drabs worsens the perception of the actual situation. 

I feel bad for the crew from Dubai and KL because chances are, the flight was one of those where abuse is endlessly heaped on the staff as a result of the passengers' frustration.",Hiskandar Zulkarnaen Hasshim,0,2016-10-30 09:59:57

Let me a comment, the route in question was wrong diagrammed and operated, this route should have done stopover in Johannesburg (JNB), not Barcelona, from here to Sao Paulo and flight continue to Buenos Aires, Argentina that is WSSS-FAOR- SBGR-SAEZ route using the B777-200ER, hopefully someday return to sail the South American skies.",Gabriel Monteleone,2,2016-10-29 19:57:34

10154684116643679_10154686679208679,"I am extremely disgusted with the customer service and handling of my parents flight. They paid for premium economy tickets to fly from Perth to London, due to needing extra space as my mother has her arm in plaster. They have been put in economy seats instead & this only came to light when their online checkin came through 48 hours before flying. My mum spent 2 hours on the phone to customer service on Friday night, and 1.5 hours last night, and it is still not resolved. The man she spoke to last night had the cheek to ask why she had left it until the day before flying to deal with it! It was your error and you are not dealing with it. She has now ended up having to purchase 2 more premium economy seats, which are obviously 3 times more expensive than what she has already paid for due to the late notice. She shouldn't be having to buy new tickets when she already holds 2 premium economy seats purchased over a month ago. She shouldn't be passed from department to department on 2 long and expensive telephone calls when it is your error. I am frankly quite shocked at your customer service.",Kate Sudo Bond,1,2016-10-30 00:17:58

This is the Menzies contact number you have provided . I have been speaking to them daily. 
I am demanding a Singapore airlines contact number not an outsourced baggage provider. 
This is a SINGAPORE AIRLINES check in issue not Menzies. They are looking for my bag and can't find it.
Given my hand luggage was forced to check in at the gate at Singapore Airlines and then STOLEN (how does it got lost between Heathrow and Singapore?) where is my bag???????
Im sick of being told to speak to one person and then another. This service is a disgrace! No regard for people's belongings! 
I demand that a Singapore airlines member call me to discuss my stolen hand luggage. If not, I'm pursuing this publicly and legally.

As we got off the plane,  we were told that there would be ground staff waiting to give us instructions.  We took the shuttle to the airport; no ground staff in sight when we arrived.  We don't know where we are supposed to go. Most of us are queuing to get through immigration, but not really knowing if that's what we should be doing, or if we should head to the transit area. I appreciate that you cannot control technical issues and cancelled the flight due to safety concerns.  However, what you can control is ensuring that we at least get the basic information - where to go, what to do, who to talk to. We have been queuing for over 30 minutes now and still no one from SQ has appeared.

10154676824593679_10154680440923679,Yes I understand. Quite disappointing for both of us as I'm sure this will lose your company more business than if there was some other solution like a travel voucher or something which would've encouraged me to spend more money with your airline. Funny thing is that the flight from Bangkok was practically empty. And people carry on multiple bags and are let in whereas we tried to stick to the rules by checking most of our luggage. Lesson learned,Rees King,1,2016-10-28 06:37:23
10154676824593679_10154680371468679,"Dear Mr King.

Thank you for taking the time to write to us via Facebook with regards to your recent experience with Singapore Airlines.

We are sorry in learning of your disappointment with our baggage policy. We wish to explain, airlines impose charges on excess baggage to discourage passengers from carrying too much baggage, in view of weight and space considerations on the aircraft.

If I may also take this opportunity to explain, with effect from 15 November 2013, Singapore Airlines had increased the baggage allowance across all classes. For instance, Economy Class travellers are now eligible to carry 30kgs of check-in baggage (excluding USA and Brazil), which is a 10kg increase from the old policy. Informatively, with the increase in baggage allowance, the no-baggage waiver policy is strictly enforced and therefore, the check-in staff at Bangkok Airport was unable to offer extra baggage allowance.

Our records show that you and Mrs Makowski arrived at the counter with a total of 70kgs of check-in baggage. As you were in excess of 10kgs, the check-in staff were duly adhering to the baggage policy and had charged you a total of THB13260.00 (USD380.00). We remain apologetic for the disappointment that had been caused and wish to assure you that our staff at Bangkok Airport were duly adhering to the baggage policy.

Please allow me wish to explain that we are transparent with our baggage policy and the information in regards to our excess baggage charges is available on our website, to ensure that our passengers are well informed and not inconvenienced at the check in counters. Please refer to the following link for your perusal;
http://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/travel-info/baggage/additional-baggage-charges/.

Mr King, we remain apologetic for the disappointment caused however thank you for the time taken to convey your feedback and allowing us the opportunity to respond.

Yours Sincerely,
Kimberley

As I mentioned after 3 months of contact with Reservations, Feedback and Ticketing departments, the response I received from Singapore Airlines was that my ticket would not be refunded nor any associated change or re-issuance fees would be waived. Even with a medical certificate provided! The decision is both highly irresponsible for a renowned international airline that purportedly places traveller safety as paramount as well as extremely disappointing! There have been other airlines around the world who have had far better policies in place in dealing with pregnant travellers to Zika virus affected regions. Singapore Airlines it appears is not one of them.

We wish to share that the first sector is a domestic flight, hence it is compulsory for check in to be done with the operating carrier, which is Virgin America. In SFO, the domestic flights operate in a different terminal from the international flights as well. We regret if this was not communicated clearly to you earlier, but we seek your kind understanding as such. Thank you.",Singapore Airlines,0,2016-10-25 17:40:50
10154672501333679_10154672640903679,"Frankly, I do not understand. Obviously, as a passenger, i am not aware of these complex transportation rules. From a passenger's point of view, i purchased the entire itinerary from SQ, and hence I check in at the SQ counter. If I had purchased the domestic tickets separately, I would have checked in with the domestic airline separately. Any anomaly should be communicated in advance and not result in the passenger wasting their time and efforts trying running around an extremely large airport to find their check in counter resulting in so much inconvenience. I was NEVER ever being informed that I should check in with Virgin for my flight. I frequent fly out of SFO, and aware how big SFO is. Imagine if I were some other passenger who has difficulties getting to one place to another, how much inconvenience would this be to move around such a big airport. Putting aside the issue that the appropriate check in counter was not communicated, it was extremely annoying that the SQ ground staff did not regard me as a passenger of SQ. She had on multiple times referred me to a Virgin America passenger and offered no help with all the troubles. I don't care what the transportation rules say as to which is the significant airline in such flight itinerary, but from a passenger point of view, I purchased the tickets from SQ, and I am only on Virgin America for 1.5 hours out of the total 15-20 hours flight, so I am a SQ customer. As a long time loyal customer of SQ for so many years, such customer services and attitude from the ground staff i extremely disappointing.",Michelle Kwan,0,2016-10-25 18:05:27

It states that it departs from terminal 2 (which is where virgin operates out from) but it doesn't state that I have to check in with Virgin at terminal 2. To me this makes sense because Virgin flies out of terminal so it departs from terminal 2. As I stated earlier, tix purchased with SQ and all flight segments have a Sq flight number, from a passenger point of view, I would have expected to check in with sq at the international terminal and not with virgin, and then head over to terminal 2 after check in for the flight. Like all other code share flights, I would typically check in with the airlines I purchased the tickets from and not the operating airline.

Despite the bad experience on the ground, I have to say that the flight crew from LAX-ICN was great and emphatic of my ordeal at the US airports. They did help me with the malfunctioning handle. I didn't catch their name, but the Malay leading steward and the Korean leading stewardess (both had the green uniform) were really  great.

I am annoyed with the check in incident but I do recognize the  good customer service onboard the flight. Ground staff seriously need to improve their service tremendously. 

Don't bother with perfunctory apologies in your response. Because I am extremely sure that when I fly SFO - LAX - NRT later in December that there will be no improvement in terms of communications to ensure that the passengers go to the right check in counter.

On my usual routine to Shanghai for business this morning via SQ.
Checked in at the first class area as my colleague has PPS Solitaire membership (priority check in regardless of ticket class)

Both Male staff at the service desk greeted my colleague with the usual SIA vim:
Good morning sir !
Welcome sir !

After one of them returned both our passports and boarding passes to my colleague with ""Have a great flight sir!"" I said to the service rep:
what about mam , do you always ignore the woman ?
The guy looked at me, did not say a word and walked off

10154671655658679_10154673795753679,"DISAGREE. After providing medical advice from my obstetrician advising against travel to Zika virus affected Singapore and enduring 3 months of being bounced around from Reservations Department, Feedback Department, Ticketing Department and the travel agency, Singapore Airlines refuses to waive reissuance fees or offer any form of recourse on tickets - even with medical advice provided! Reasons cited by Singapore Airlines included the severity of the virus doesn't warrant a waiver and it is unable to offer any waiver (they don't say why) on any fees in the booking beyond the terms and conditions agreed to at the time of payment. Do you need a virus to be severe to consider a pregnant traveller's circumstance and in the meantime do you expect/advocate pregnant travellers to risk their pregnancies and complete their travel? Extremely irresponsible and truly disappointing for a renowned airline, especially one that brags about being ranked #1 for Best International Airlines (Conde Nast Traveller)!

10154671655658679_10154678359153679,"Talice Ang Hi Talice, our website is designed to reflect the lowest available fares at the point of checking/booking. Due to the system's dynamic nature, fare availability can change very quickly, whether this means going up or going down. It is possible that the lower fare which you saw subsequently was due to other passengers having withdrawn their booking for the same flight, thus releasing back the cheaper fare into the system. If our passengers who secured a higher fare earlier via our website would like to change to the lower fare, they may contact our Reservations office to make the change, but this may be subject to fees respective to the terms and conditions of their purchased ticket. If the ticket was purchased via a travel agent, the agent will be able to advise whether a change is possible, and if so, what the associated change fees are, if any. We seek your understanding that it is not our intention to disadvantage our passengers in any way.",Singapore Airlines,1,2016-10-27 14:42:53
10154671655658679_10154687513783679,"Going forward in the months and years ahead, airfares are expected to drop even further as the price of crude oil is expected to crash to the US$ 20's per barrel level. Moreover, increased competition from the Big 3 Middle Eastern carriers (Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways), China Southern Airlines, Air China, and budget carriers will only drive down airfares in the long run. As an example, there's no hurry to purchase a ticket for Q3/Q4 2017 travel to Europe at the moment when many airlines are now advertising ""Early Bird Special Discounted Fares to Europe for 2017 Travel"" as they want the passenger's to lock-in at today's ""Special"" fares and generate their cash flow now rather than when the departure dates are much closer because of the risk of much lower airfares going forward.",Albert T.

As we got off the plane,  we were told that there would be ground staff waiting to give us instructions.  We took the shuttle to the airport; no ground staff in sight when we arrived.  We don't know where we are supposed to go. Most of us are queuing to get through immigration, but not really knowing if that's what we should be doing, or if we should head to the transit area. I appreciate that you cannot control technical issues and cancelled the flight due to safety concerns.  However, what you can control is ensuring that we at least get the basic information - where to go, what to do, who to talk to.

Alice and I are two passionate Malaysian girls who will be fundraising and raising awareness for life limiting illness among children by going as far as we can without a penny in 30 hours under Jailbreak RAG 2016. 

Do you know 40000 children suffer from life limiting illness in England? Life- limiting conditions are conditions where there is no reasonable hope of cure and from which chilren will die before reaching adulthood. These conditions cause progressive deterioration which require 24 hour care with the care burden met by family members.

WE ARE IN NEED OF AN AIR TICKET SPONSORSHIP! Destination? As far as we can IN 30 hours! Malaysia? New zealand? Australia? Hong kong? We hope to raise awareness to as many people and collect as much fund as possible for the need. 

We will be truly honoured if you would like to be on board with our mission by sponsoring us! Looking forward to receiving a positive reply from you.

10154665077158679_10154665602548679,"I beg to differ. SIA provide really great service. the post seems a lil bit exagerrated to be honest. personally SIA is really great thus even if there were imperfections, the good will still outweigh the bad. It cant be that bad to the point where everything is wrong (timing,food,etc). U pointed out that the stewardess asked the toddler to watch Dori yet you criticized this act. By doing so, isnt she trying to help calm the toddler? ""As if watching dori will solve anything"" So why criticize the effort? Have you ever asked urself, wat effective alternative u have other than to comfort a baby by mentioning a cartoon character? I dont think u really cared abt the toddler crying.

My point here is that at the end of the day, what you perceive as bad, may just be fine to others. Long waiting time? Well, safety is is utmost priority i rather wait a bit longer for the safety checks to be completed rather than risking my life. Horrendous food? Well diff ppl have diff taste maybe u wont really like singaporean-made food. Bad chief stewardess? Well at least she tried cheering the toddler up with dori. effort n thought was there. What did you do? Sit down there and complain? How about adopt a new life mindset where u bring change to ppl instead of expecting a change from ppl.
Like i said, if u really cared about the mother and toddlers situation, u would have intefere and done something during the flight to help them out?",Steph AyamCurry Bin KobeBriyanni,0,2016-10-24 13:38:02

As we got off the plane,  we were told that there would be ground staff waiting to give us instructions.  We took the shuttle to the airport; no ground staff in sight when we arrived.  We don't know where we are supposed to go. Most of us are queuing to get through immigration, but not really knowing if that's what we should be doing, or if we should head to the transit area. I appreciate that you cannot control technical issues and cancelled the flight due to safety concerns.  However, what you can control is ensuring that we at least get the basic information - where to go, what to do, who to talk to. We have been queuing for over 30 minutes now and still no one from SQ has appeared. The whole situation has been appallingly handled and honestly I expected more from an airline who prides itself in its service. #SQFail #SQ377",Li Vyrn Chin,0,2016-10-28 17:14:59

10154661455808679_10154662425013679,"Hallo. I use to admire SQ every time I fly with SQ. You guys are doing superb job as always. I was kind of disappointed the last time my family and I flew with SQ from SFO to SIN to MDC. For some reason there were some of your personnel who didn't have sympathy with family with children. The problem started from SFO to SIN when the sit arraignment was done for us to sit together, but when we got into the airplane they intentionally put us apart. I thought it was just a mistake so with heavy heart I agree to do that even though we had a hard time going back and forth taking care of the kids while in the airplane. The problem persist when we came back from SIN to SFO, I felt embarrassed because I had to fight to get the same sit that to me really bother other passengers while we argue in the airplane. Our sit was actually prearrange while we still at MDC, but when we got into the airplane at SIG they intentionally change our sit. At last I really felt sorry because two elderly couple were ask by your stewardess to move so we as family could sit together. In fact those were our prearranged sit. I'm just hoping that this situation don't repeat again to other passengers. Or perhaps when we have another change to fly with SQ again.  I really think this is an isolated incidence even though it happened to us twice.",Teddy Rantung,0,2016-10-22 15:42:54

10154661455808679_10154662449028679,"Hi Singapore Airlines.. Im very disappointed with my experience as krisflyer member.
I book a flight using krisflyer point for my honeymoon since 4 months back until now when we're need to go next week still on waiting list. 4 months back, normal ticket was available and yet SQ put me on waiting list because I'm using krisflyer point. If SQ put low priority and give the seat on left over basic, where is the proudness of being krisflyer membership? it's quite useless. We spend and accumulate krisflyer point, in the end it's quite useless whereyou only give low priority.
One of returning ticket was just available and we confirmed the ticket, to my surprise, there is no more seat available next to each other. Very sad to go for honeymoon and sit seperately.
When I call SQ cust svc, all of them are total useless, they can only say they can not do anything because the system control, only ask me to wait until 3 hours before departure hoping someone will give up the seat, become desperate for seat. while in the begining 4 months ago, there are still many empty seats, and yet, you guys dont give us the seat, want to earn money from normal guest rather than appreciating your own member.
This is not the my first bad and frustating experience redeeming point from SQ, many times happend like that. SQ point and membership are useless, no need to be so loyal accumulating SQ point while SQ look down on krisflyer point redeemer. Only worry and frustation I will get from redeeming my points",Rudy Tjahjana,1,2016-10-22 15:49:30

10154657227658679_10154661296513679,"I would like to share my horrendous experience with Singapore Airlines. I was due to return to Singapore on SQ861, departing on 21st October, 340pm. I was informed by my colleagues in Hong Kong on Thursday morning that based on the information by Hong Kong Observatory (HKO), the typhoon will likely impact all flights on Friday. I immediately contacted SQ hotline on thurs late morning to fly out on Thursday night before the typhoon. I was told that the flights are full and SQ861 is still on schedule. I reached out them again on Thursday night and was given the same response. An hour later, I was informed via sms that SQ861 was cancelled and I have to called SQ hotline to make arrangement for alternative flight. 
When I reached out to them, I was told that all flights on sat and sun were full and the next available flight out is on Monday morning. 

First of all, I have made at least four international call to SQ and wasted more than 90 mins on the phone with them.

Secondly, they should know the potential impact of the storm and help provide alternatives to customers who are affected. They should not expect the customer who are overseas to call and make arrangement for themselves. I was lucky to be able to extend my stay at the hotel (thanks to W HK) by another three days but that disrupted my plans for the weekend.

Lastly, the customer support/service  is poorly informed and ill equipped to handle incidents of this magnitude. When I requested to be place on other airlines within the star alliance, the customer service has no clue and no ability to support the customer.
FYI, my colleague who reached out to Cathay pacific on Thursday morning (same time as me) was able to change her flight. 
As a customer who has accumulated more than one hundred thousand KF miles in a year, I believe there are airlines out there who will provide a better service. Goodbye Singapore Airlines, you will not be missed....",Lennon Tan,1,2016-10-22 07:06:03

10154654972853679_10154655052718679,"Hi Aileen, you can store the milk in our chillers but we have limited space, as the chillers are used for passengers' meals. Storage in the chillers is hence subject to space availability. We can only accept 100ml bottles to be stored in the chillers due to space constraints in our chillers on board.

As the temperature of the chillers is not controllable on board, we recommend you store the milk in a smaller cooler bag measuring 17cm x 17cm x 23cm or smaller, with ice packs or other cooling apparatus as required to ensure the milk is chilled. We'd suggest bringing enough breast milk as you need to nurse your infant for the entire journey. The combined weight of the infant food, breast milk and amenities you may bring on board should not exceed 6kg. This is in addition to your 7kg free cabin baggage allowance.

But since it is a brand new plane, why there was audio issue which held us on the runway for an hour departing from SIN and 4 TVs not functioning on premium economy seats on the way back. Senior steward said will come back to let us know if there is other solution but didnt. 
Biz class service was great but premium economy was served by someone not in a very good mood that day. Services seems to be rather inconsistent these days. 
Hopefully things will get better cos SQ we want you to be on the top as always.

Book the cook was absolutely a must if on business class, premium economy. The two different cod fish dishes were fantastically yumz, lobster so so, fish porridge was handsomely gorgeous especially for breakfast. 
Chicken breast was juicy. The pillow on premium was so soft and comfortable. The seat was way better than JAL. Well..beside no TV for 12hrs. :-)",Xiong Gab,2,2016-10-20 12:23:01

---- India for change sake should become wise and clever against theocratic Islamic political ideology (which trifurcated the motherland in 1947). Also India should realize that China has not done anything wrong with India (Regarding humiliating defeat in Indo-China 1962 war, if India did not use its superior Air power against China then China can't be blamed for this. Moreover Indo-China border dispute is legal and can easily be solved through Judicial commission).

Hence India should grab this platinum opportunity, to once and for all, destroy Jihadi terrorism culture emanating from Pakistan by accepting the offer of Pakistan for Extended-SAARC, as explained below:-

Come on people! Put yourself in the shoes! This is just someone politely asking for advice for something she had never encountered before! She is not Osama or what!

It is not a matter of being victimized or unfair treatment. No Company would like to treat any customer unfairly, it does not make good business sense. 

My suggestion is to discard the phone into the nearest body of water, wherever you are. 
Inform Samsung, Singapore by email that you are coming back to claim a replacement phone.  Produce proof that you are overseas when the ban was imposed, (boarding passes & e-ticket) and exit chop of the country you visited.

10154634959303679_10154635527758679,"I understand it's beyond frustrating for those overseas already - but you aren't actually stranded - the airline isn't refusing to carry you on your pre-purchased flights - you just can't carry a prohibited item onboard the aircraft. 

It's a phone - yes it may be an expensive item, and most of us live with a phone in our hands (I'm certainly not exempt from that myself at times) - but it is just a possession. Download or upload your photos, save your contacts and try posting the phone in the mail. You could try and contact your travel insurance company or Samsung directly to see what they can do to help as Singapore, Qantas, Jetstar, and others are already onboard with this new policy, and I expect all airlines will follow suit in due course.",Nicole Norton,20,2016-10-15 10:12:32

Only one incident of a note 7 smoking in a plane occurred globally, and this was when the device was switched on. According to aviation requirements from FAA, this probability can be calculated, if a short period of exception with the phones turned off and in a fire sock is allowed, the probability of an explosion in a plane is extremely negligible. You getting hit by a car is a greater probability than you having a switched on note 7 explode on board a plane.

Your puerile posting of a defaced Singapore girl poster shows what kind of upbringing you have. Perhaps you should reflect on yourself  rather than call the kettle black. I cannot see how fluoride toxicity bears any relevance to your case here unless you are hinting all Singaporeans in Singapore are exposed to a toxic level in our drinking water. If that is the case, I hate to disappoint you on your ignorance and naivety but our water contains 0.7 ppm, thats parts per  million in case you do not know and this is well within a safe level for our body to consume. I have screenshot your post so don't even bother removing. I certainly hope for your sake your post do not go viral on singapore's forum",Chris Lee,9,2016-10-12 06:48:12

Please keep drinking sewage with added fluoride and swallow your toothpaste too at 1450 ppm, in case u don't know. Many Singaporeans don't mean ALL. Even just 2 can qualified for using plural form. :D",Irene Mortensen,0,2016-10-12 07:21:31
10154689646649165_10154689885404165,Irene Mortensen Were you taught to swallow toothpaste? Makes me wonder what else do you swallow :) No body in Singapore drinks sewage water except perhaps for you for whatever reason. That explains your fluoride toxication.  I am not saying it is right to steal from the transport system however are you saying all Germans are honest enough to not cheat the system? Your vile posting targeting a specific group of people seem to hint there is a underlying agenda. Are you sore because you have applied for a crew position and got rejected?

I would hope that you focus on the later and not the former. As James Killingsworth has pointed out we read a lot about SQ mishaps recently. I ha ENT read anywhere that you are increasing training standards, check rides, simulator work. You need to re-assure the traveling public that such matters are in hand- social media is a good way of achieving this. Also so are your flight attendants and staff who can make a direct impact on the public.

I sat down and reclined my seat but the man behind me pushed the seat till my seat was upright.  He did it 2x, I thought it was a mechanical problem when it happened the first time, but the second time, I realized it was the guy behind me.  Instead of reprimanding the violent passenger, they expected me to move to a non aisle seat.  I could not travel without an aisle seat.  The passenger in front of me reclined her seat and the TV was right on my face, but it was her right to recline.  I wonder If the situation will be better handled if I were a White Male passenger?  I now have a cervical whiplash.  btw, the violent passenger was not a big man seating on an aisle.",Yin Reber,1,2016-10-10 04:23:07

So I asked Japanese grand hostess if we could board in the aircraft because my little son was too tiring. This grand hostess told me that there are many first class customer, so children must wait as others. I've never served like this way in the past, and I was very much up set by service of Singapore Airline in Osaka. We are Japanese, why we had to be  treated by such bad manner in Osaka???

I didn't ask Japanese ground hostess that my son and I could board firster than first class and business class passengers. As same as other Airlines, I thought that small children and disability people could board with business and first class customers, because they always told us just before boarding. The other flight from Singapore to Perth with Singapore Airline, we could board with first and business class passengers even though there were full of passengers. Also I have never treated like this bad manner by any other flights in the past.  Singapore Airlines told the best Airline. In my opinion, if people has many travel experience with baby and little children, or disability, they will be wonder which service is called the best. I wonder if you have any little children and traveled with them 😉 I think that you don't have any 😚 Also you said service is depend on the countries or staff???? Do you think that Singapore Airline would treat people with little children different way because of different countries or different staff? If this is true, it won't call professional.

If yes, then there shouldn't be a problem as it doesn't take long for them to board. That difference of a few minutes, I'm sure you can consider. If you boarded last, then it's reasonable for you to complain. Everybody would like to board first and everybody would like the best seats but do you think it is possible to please everyone? Don't talk about professionalism, all those airline employees are there just doing their best, unfortunately, there will always be unhappy passengers on any flight. Look at the bright side.

Also grand hostess of the gate in Osaka doesn't train well as how to talk to their customer in the International airport. You should read what I write down carefully, then you can tell me your opinion. Anyway I was wonder how this Airline could say the best Airline. I'm an experienced traveler and a caring professional pharmacist myself. I know what I can complain in the public media 😉😏😝 Also I know how to treat people with children and disability💖, and I know what is professional work 👍",Atsuko Lucas Andrew,0,2016-10-15 22:32:36

I was traveling business class  seated on row 15 F  i I was totally disappointed with the crews on the section   They were very impartial on the treatment of passengers   My lunch order was taken they miss giving my meals completely   I have  waited  for another  crew to come along so  I can ask for my  lunch.    When they give my lunch.  She said. Sorry  it's a. Mis understanding.         That's was the excuse given to me.

10154614117408679_10154626580483679,"Well Singapore airlines you have certainly gone down in my estimation. I booked return flights from Brisbane to Manchester back in March for flights in January . 10 months before we were due to fly. The reason I booked this early was to reserve the PREFFERED seats as I am a tall guy and need extra legroom. These seats were booked and was excited about our upcoming trip.
I have recently received emails off you saying some of these PREFFERED seats are now not available !!! No explanation given and where possible you would try and reallocate PREFFERED to us. You have even said only one seat was available to be allocated which means my wife would be sitting somewhere else on the Singapore - Manchester leg. Not good enough !!! 

If I had known you were going to do this to our booking I would never have booked with you in the first place. 

I sincerely hope you can remedy this poor customer experience and come up with a satisfactory solution so that I can sit by my wife in extra legroom seats for the whole journey as was planned originally !!",Graham Rathbone,0,2016-10-13 06:15:36

You really need to improve your marketing, your connecting time and even your Visit Singapore campaigns, to bring more premium customers back and even connectivity. Same destinations is being contested by low cost carriers, so I think we need to tap new markets and improve tours to connections, yes the A350 is a good airplane machine, that will give your airline more success. Sorry I oppose the management decision for focusing Airbus 380s, and using a low-cost airline like Scoot for long-haul decisions, and for reducing flights. Your a world-class brand that needs more improved marketing and more efficient jets like the Boeing 777X.

10154608793103679_10154610377058679,"I've flown a lot with Singapore Airlines already, I had great experiences to begin with but your services have been declining. I won't go into specifics but customer satisfactory in terms of handling and service should be kept up to high standards. Last year i asked when the company intended to give all customers free wifi during long haul flights but it's still a service to be paid for? Myself and many others find this UNACCEPTABLE in the year 2016. One specific company that does very well and offers free wifi service on their 777 and A380 fleet are Emirates. Why can't Singapore do ""more""?",Dominique Blondeel,4,2016-10-07 23:36:05

At the same time, we also have to look at whether providing certain services free-of-charge, such as inflight wifi, is sustainable for us. But where we can, we will try to improve our passengers' overall inflight experience. We have lined up some plans for the future, and will share them with our passengers in due course. We are grateful for your support and hope we can continue looking forward to it as we endeavour to improve our passenger experience.",Singapore Airlines,1,2016-10-07 23:45:02

Put that aside and i'm still a satisfied customer. Leg room, service, cabin hostesses and the great meals prove at which standard Singapore Airlines operates. Which is at a high standard. Very respectable, but with high standards come high demands. I firmly believe that ""if possible"" offering free wifi would please everybody travelling with you. Being the best means being able to offer the best services allround. I hope you guys can make it happen as it's otherwise extremely expensive and it could help reduce the stress load on a 12-13 hour flight. :)",Dominique Blondeel,0,2016-10-07 23:48:59

10154608793103679_10154610594103679,"Hi Dominique, nothing is ever really free unless it is yours. In the case of free wifi on board the cost would be built into the price of the ticket surely? I can do without wifi in the sky if it keeps the cost of my ticket more affordable, and it gives me time to be off social media that I am otherwise glued to when on land. If I have to pay for the wifi I won't so I can watch movies I never have time to see or sleep to adjust my body clock to its new timezone. Just my opinion though.",Marion Phillips,7,2016-10-08 01:19:57

After all, SQ is still my preferred air carrier.",Led Chu Ching Yee,1,2016-10-06 09:30:45
10154605978803679_10154606077428679,It is certainly your prerogative to feedback and i do not mean anything in a rude way. However i find it hard to comprehend how can anyone be hungry 3 hours after meal service. Although saying that it would indeed be nice if they were to serve meal slightly closer to lunch say 11 instead of 9.,Chris Lee,0,2016-10-06 09:59:35

We are very sorry for the staff member's oversight on this occasion. The staff member involved has been counselled on the importance of providing our passengers with the correct information at all times. ""

Dear Mr Yong
Thank you for your reaching out to Singapore Airlines via the Facebook page regarding qualification for Elite Gold membership. We apologise for the delayed response to you query.
Our record shows that, since 2 October 2016 we have tried contacting you via your Singapore mobile phone, but were unable to reach you.

We are most appreciative of the time you have taken to give us your views and feedback with regard to our service as it is through such comments that we are able to monitor our services and keep abreast of customers' expectations. We are sorry to learn of your displeasure, for not being able to deliver a service that was up to your expectations in this instance.
Current mechanism for Elite Gold qualification and renewal does not allow excess Elite miles to be rolled over or carried forward to your next qualification period.  Even if the minimum requirement of Elite miles is accrued before the given period, the membership can only be renewed at the end of the qualification period as it cannot be shortened.  Although there is currently no plan to make any changes to the current KrisFlyer membership programme, please allow us to assure you that we are continuously reviewing and working on enhancing our frequent flyer programme. All constructive feedback, such as yours, will be collated and considered seriously.

Do allow us to share with you , we review members' accounts on a case-by-case basis and will assist members as much as possible as the end of their qualification period approaches.  During such evaluation, excess Elite mileage accrued in previous qualification periods will be one of the qualifying factors for consideration should there be a shortfall of Elite miles required for a membership renewal.

We hope this will give you some measure of assurance with regard to your membership renewal.

Mr Yong, thank you for writing to us and we look forward to being of service to you again.

Yours sincerely
Thasneem Hadhija

Actually for the delay part I am acceptable because is normal for flight to delay, but advance part isn't it not reasonable specially advance 4 hours. I call up your customer service hotline twice, they can't offer any help. Although u send an email in advance but I have pay up my fullday land tour and purchased all those tickets for all those entertainment for that day. My land tour will drop us at the airport about 5 plus pm to catch our flight at 815pm. Now because of the time advancement of scoot I need to cancel the land tour without refund. Who is going to bear the cost? Is there a full refund on the land tour that we can claim back from scoot? I am not being mean on this, even your delay on my first flight I accept but the early fly off part isn't it unfair to passengers that have make up booking and plans. If let's say, now my trip is a business trip,so is it we need to ask customer to cancel the meeting Coz we need to fly back early. Are you telling the business man should not fly with scoot because anytime scoot will fly off early and you need to drop off all your plan. Ends up, to make less hassle, I thought to change my ticket to next day but cost me a boom.My current ticket is about $200, to change to next day will need to TOP up $240.70 inclusive admin n changes charges ($440.70) where else now Thai Airways is selling at $280.00 at 29/9/16inc bags and full on board meals. I also did ask possibility to have a full refund. Suprise me is, full refund is subjected to approval and will take 8 weeks to process and might be rejected. Ends up, we still need to fly back with this scoot. Most of all, scoot will only pay back a partial refund might lower then 50% and customers service can't even answer how much scoot can refund. I am so confused, if I buy a new ticket and scoot can't refund then ends up I will be holding two tickets. One passenger why need to have two tickets to fly at same place? Scoot customer service make us feel, yes changes is confirm and you have no choice thought we delay ur flight and advance your flight. Not happy, fly with other airline this how I feel when I call up. Even now scoot delay and advance the flight, as passenger can only follow...like we often say LL. Really disappointed with scoot supposed to fly at lower cost with happy plan ends up higher cost because we pay for our plan and all spoilt by scoot.

10154591182548679_10154593527983679,Hi SQ  I sent a complaint about the treatment of an 86 yr old lady at Melbourne airport when she as awaiting assistance. The passengers have arrived in Sri lanka now and apart from the problems in Melbourne my brother said the SQ staff and service was fantastic in Singapore as well as in the flight to sin and from sin to cbo. It was my perception that the staff manning the booking counte as well as the customer service counter in Melb were not SQ employees as previously they were definitely SQ employees. As it is a service industry the staff in melbourne should be reinforced on the need for customer service as well as doing what is expected. We are not asking for more than offered by other airlines and hence it would be good even if you are hiring external agencies to man the counte in Melbourne they should have the same politeness and efficiency and care give by those SQ employees in SQ.

10154591182548679_10154593578593679,"Herewith is a cop of my initial complaintI just returned from Tullamarine airport after dropping a 86 yr lady who was travelling by SQ 228 to Singapore and colombo. She was accompanying 2 others and as she was unabled to walk more than very very short distances she wanted to be booked with SQ due to its reputation. Going by the experience from the air lines I wish to comment on the pathetic and deplorable service. She was at the airport prior to the counters opening and eventually checked in around 1300 hrs. As she was unable to walk and as per airline policy she was told that she had to await arrival of an employee to take her by wheel chair. Hence around after 1415 when the SQ customer service desk was approached we were told that there was a personnel issue and we have to wait. By that time almost all passengers were checked in and a person came and wheeled one person and asked others to follow her by foot inspite of this 86 year old lady being unable to walk and she was seated on her wheelchair. This person also too this 86 yr lady's passport and boarding pass and disappeared. When we complained to the customer service department they phoned around and eventually the passport and boarding pass was returned and we were waiting for someone to take her to the aircraft as the accompanying passengers were not authorised to wheel her. We were concererned that she was not being attended to and eventually someone took her wheelchair after many visits to the customer service department. Iam sorry to say THIS 3RD CLASS TREATMENT OF PEOPLE NEEDING ASSISTANCE TO BOARD THE PLANE MY IMPRESSION IS 1)SQ IS NOW CUTTING COSTS AND HENCE THERIR SERVICES ARE SUFFERING. 2) PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY ARE JUST TOLERATED AND SQ IS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT HAVING THEM AS PASSENGERS> 3) SQ CHARGES THE FULL RATE AND GIVES SERVICES OF CUT PRICE AIRLINE TIGER 4)IN MY OPINION SQ AND AEROFLOT ARE COMPARABLE AND AT PRESENT QUANTAS IS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE SQ. 5)SQ HAS TO DECLARE CUTTING DOWN ON STANDARDS INSTEAD OF DOING IT LIKE THIS SQ YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE THE FRONT FOR YOUR AIRLINE AND IF YOU ARE GIVING RUBBISH SERVICE PLEASE LET US KNOW SO THAT WE CAN FIND ALTERNATIVES4)ALSO SQ EMPLOYEE DISAPPEARING WITH THIS LADY'S PASSPORT GAVE A LOT OF ANXIETY AS WE ARE TOLD NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE PASSPORT I HOPE THIS IS ONE OFF AND NOT GIVING US TRASHY SERVICE

Such items will include ladies' handbag, camera/camera bag and document bags. Do note however, the maximum dimensions for these bags are 40x30x10cm each. If your item exceeds the total dimension of 80cm (the length, width and height combined), it will be counted as part of your standard cabin baggage allowance.

If you are not happy with them u can always bring it to the ombudsman. Sq is not entirely at fault here and the onus is also on you to check what happens to your ticket during a no show. Crying like a little child for a refund is not exactly helping your cause. Sq has my utmost respect for their patience dealing with customers like you. Since you will not be flying with sq anymore i really dont see why they should even bother with you.,Chris Lee,1,2016-09-27 15:39:05

My last flight with them 4 yrs ago two flight attendants took my luggage off the carousel, I am now 68. I have been flying out of Sydney all my life and Singapore Airlines goes above and beyond, my daughter bought me their signature bag and apron, which I love, always take the bag with me.  The food on board is good with an ice cream at the end.

After forwarding the medical certificate to Singapore Airlines, they are offering me a $129 refund for a $543 fare. Or a credit, with a $330 change fee. This is a very disappointing decision by a world class airline. I would consider that Singapore Airlines would be more compassionate and fair than this. Even Jetstar a budget airline, has a more generous compassionate change policy.

10154566661593679_10154569032778679,I can still remember the 1st time l travelled with SIA to California. I am not feeling well when serving foods l don't want to eat anything. But they still try to give some foods that I can eat and not oily for me also not in the menu for economy class passenger. I travelled with some airlines when they ask anything l want to order in the menu if l am not feeling well told them don't feel like eating. Some airlines they just gave some drinks or bread that all. Some they even never gave anything at all. When serving foods I am sleeping after I wait up they will serve the foods for me even the serving time is over but some airlines after serving time I wait up already no more foods for me at all only can ask for cool drinks or hot beverage. To me SIA is the best airlines in the world.,Melanie Cher,0,2016-09-23 22:45:25

I then try and call a singapore airlines agent in canberra and the number is disconnected. Next I spent over 30 minutes on the phone trying to book a ticket with an international singarore airlines agent.  I'm thinking its easier to fly with qantas even if it is via sydney.

With regards to your 2nd question, you would be able to receive your boarding pass either at Austin or at SFO for your boarding passes of SFO-SIN and SIN-MAA. Do approach the ground staff when you check-in if you have further queries.

We hope this clarifies.

Thank you.",Singapore Airlines,1,2016-09-23 05:05:46
10154566766088679_10154566782403679,"Thank you for your quick response. Yes both the flights from SFO-SIN and SIN-MAA is operated by Singapore airlines, so I just need to be remain seated in transit area at Changi airport and wait for my flight to MAA? 

My first flight from Austin to SFO is operated by Virgin America airlines ( SQ1425) so will they provide me the boarding passes for all three flights ( AUS-SFO, SFO-SIN, SIN-MAA)? Or will they just provide the boarding pass for flight from AUS-SFO and do I need to collect the boarding pass for SFO-SIN and SIN-MAA at SFO? 

Also will my checked in baggage  will be checked through to my final destination ( MAA ) at Austin or do I need to pick up the baggage at SFO and re check in again? Please clarify me, I am really confused with this code share flight booking.

As for issuance of boarding passes through to MAA, this should also be possible, but we would advise that you check again with the staff at Austin when you check-in for your flight. As for your query on whether you can remain seated at Changi Airport to wait for your flight to MAA, there should be ground staff at the arrival gate following your SFO-SIN flight who can direct you on where to go for your SIN-MAA flight.

I assume that your flight from Singapore to Manchester via Munich does the same thing every trip ie passengers stay on board while you clean etc ? Well I'm sorry but we won't be no more. It was a complete shambles after a 12 hour flight to then be told to "" stay in your seats and not use the toilets"". Then Munich airport staff wondering up n down trying to count people as we got fed up waiting just sitting and then when you could move you were then getting pushed about by cleaning staff trying to clean round you for new passengers to board the plane. Most of these staff could not speak English or where even polite as they pushed passed other people and including YOUR OWN flight crews. It would of made more sense to have emptied the plane fully so all staff had room to work especially as there were very few passengers left most if not all were economy class ( or is this the reason we got treat like this ? ) I guess I'm not the first or will be the last to complain about our treatment, and I'm sorry but it spoiled  a pleasant holiday away for a special birthday which my wife had saved hard to take us on.

Paralympic and Olympic will never be the same because for paralympic, everyone is a winner. But in Olympic, only the winner will be remembered. For those who say they should be treated the same, are perhaps those who have never even watch a single event of Paralympic nor do they know the names of any competitors to Yip's events. As for SIA, its important to remember that 1 million miles to a disable is different because for every flight she takes, at least one will accompany Yip on a paid ticket. If the intention is to help the disable, then we should be talking about help for the entire diable community here in Singapore instead of just paralmpic winners.

I totally agree that Yip should be given the same as Schooling in terms of invitation to parliament and in fact more as she has achieved 2 gold medals (and not to mention she has  to overcome her disability).",May Brathwaite,1,2016-09-20 20:57:18
