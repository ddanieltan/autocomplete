And that “ Indians outnumbered Eurasians 20 to 1 and that makes it difficult for ( there to be) an Eurasian President"".
 
All of this is completely false. During my session which lasted 90 minutes, I said nothing of the sort attributed to me, about Eurasians. In fact I wasn’t asked about Eurasians at all, either by  Mr Theseira or anyone else. And I made no comments at all about Eurasians. There was no question posed to me, relating to Eurasians, and there was no discussion on Eurasians.
 
Am quite shocked at such outright falsehoods.
 
The allegations are a complete fabrication, and I will be making a police report.

Our Officers did very well, engaging the man, assessing, because the life of the boy was at risk. And finally they moved in at the right time, and did it very quickly and well.

But this cannot be the work of the government alone. Every one has a role to play.

What will you do, if you are caught in an attack. Would you be able to help yourself? 

Would you be able to help your family, someone else? 

Would you be able to give details to the Police, using the new App? 

Would you be able to help mobilise the community to respond?

SG Secure will train people on the above. SGSecure aims to  mobilise the whole nation against terrorism. We ask for people to come forward and volunteer, have yourself trained.

Mr SR Nathan has passed away, aged 92.
 
An extraordinary life. 50 years in public service. Totally dedicated to Singapore.

A unionist, top civil servant, Ambassador to Malaysia and the US, community worker. President. 

And a man who has lived life to its fullest.

Despite growing up in harsh and difficult times, Mr Nathan persevered and worked his way up. His life revolved around helping others. He started out as a medical social worker before joining the union and was a key figure in creating NTUC.

During his time in Ministry of Defence (Singapore), he risked his life in the Laju hijacking incident, in exchange for the safe release of Singaporean hostages. As Ambassador to the USA under MFA, he dealt with the Michael Fay incident, firmly and diplomatically defending our point of view. His charm and toughness showed the world that we were no pushovers.

Mr Nathan served as President for 12 years with grace, dignity and compassion. He established the President's Challenge to help the less fortunate. During the Global Financial Crisis, he approved the request to draw on our reserves after being advised and briefed by the Council of Presidential Advisors. We emerged unscathed from the crisis.
 
Even after stepping down, Mr Nathan continued to work. He often attended events and fund-raisers to help the needy, which he deeply cared for. He wrote and published several books, sharing his wisdom accumulated over decades of experience.
 
In May this year, a group of friends, formerly colleagues and ordinary Singaporeans presented him a book titled “With Gratitude”.  It captures their stories of how Mr Nathan’s kindness touched their lives.

203314719715066_1101863556526840,"Scandalous cross examination of women victims
----------------------------------------------------------
Media reports show that lawyer Edmund Wong was severely told off by the Judge.  He had said, to a female victim, that it was her clothes and size of breasts that led to her being molested!  His case theory was that only attractive women get molested.  Novel argument. They don’t (as far as I know) teach that in law school.  I wonder what Edmund’s response will be if he was told all men who say this should be castrated.
 
Women, who are victims of sexual assault, are seen as fair game in court for cross-examination. Their past, sexual history etc. are looked into, to make the suggestion of looseness and therefore consent. 

A few weeks ago, I had posted on the travails of the victim in the Stanford rape case involving Brock Turner. The hearing put the victim through unacceptable examination. This happens in many places in the world, with court processes which, in my view, are not sufficiently sensitive to what victims have gone through. The counter argument that there could be a frame up, and therefore the allegations should be thoroughly examined, is also true. But there must be a better way to do this.
 
Earlier this year, I had asked my officials to look into the current legal process, to consider changes in the way the investigations and trials are conducted, when women are the alleged victims. And I have asked them to also consult with NGOs, others , including organisations seeking to protect women’s interests.

-------------------------------------------------------------
There has been troubling news of riots in Indonesia, last Friday evening (in Tanjung Balai, North Sumatra). Fortunately, Indonesian police managed to bring the situation under control overnight.

At least six Chinese temples were reportedly burnt during the riots.

Reports suggest that the incident was sparked by an insensitive remark by a Chinese lady. She was apparently upset by the loud call to prayer from a mosque in front of her house. She went to the mosque to confront the Imam.

Her argument with the Imam was reported on social media. News soon spread, tensions escalated and the situation very quickly deteriorated into mass looting and damage of property. Hundreds of people were allegedly involved. Several Chinese pagodas and monasteries were set on fire.

Local police managed to stop groups from burning down the woman’s house but could not prevent the temples from being attacked. The Indonesian police has blamed social media for inciting the violence with false, provocative news that riled people.

We see time and again how an insensitive remark, argument can quickly spark a major riot or conflict. And news, as well as rumours can easily spread, and the consequences can be clashes along ethnic, religious lines.

Attached are some media reports on the incident.

203314719715066_1093091990737330,"KPMG’s damning Report on AHTC, millions not properly accounted for, KPMG questions integrity and ethics of AHTC
---------------------------------------------------
The latest monthly progress report on Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) issued by KPMG paints a devastating account of the Workers’ Party’s mis-management of its town council. It is a damning litany of highly irregular and suspicious financial practices, poor governance structures and extensive leadership failures. 
 
KPMG, AHTC’s own independent accountants, has uncovered even more faults than the Auditor-General’s Office (AGO) and AHTC’s statutory auditors. AGO and AHTC’s statutory auditors found 115 failures. KPMG uncovered another 70 – making a total of 185 failures. Since the AGO audit, the situation has not gotten better. It has gotten far worse.
 
KPMG says:
•       AHTC’s “control failures,” were “pervasive, cutting across the key areas of governance, financial control, financial reporting, procurement and records management over the course of five years.”
•       There was no “culture of compliance to controls”. 
•       “There was no ….…enforcement of integrity and ethical values,” 
 
KPMG’s Report underlines the key issue: AHTC’s leadership has neither upheld nor enforced integrity and ethical values. The rot is at the top. This should come as no surprise. The High Court and the Court of Appeal have already criticised Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Pritam Singh for suppressing the truth (designed to mislead) both in Parliament and in Court. To them, the truth is a tradable commodity. I will say more about this in another post.
 
KPMG also found that AHTC’s lapses were not isolated, but rather “pervasive” and “systemic”: “There is an issue larger than the sum of individual lapses at AHTC”, it says, “a failure in the control environment”, which “includes the governance and management functions and the attitudes, awareness and actions of those charged with governance and management”.
 
KPMG said that AHTC used highly irregular shortcuts to process millions of dollars in payments to related parties, and “suppliers”. It used “dummy” vendor codes for payments, without specifying who the suppliers were. These practices could have concealed duplicate or fraudulent payments. Obviously, WP’s leadership thought they could play Aljunied residents – and Singaporeans -- for dummies.
 
Despite auditors flagging concerns over four years – including the AGO itself – AHTC’s Finance & Investment Committee and Audit Committee were not bothered. They didn’t even meet regularly to deal with the issues.
 
The attitude of AHTC in dealing with its severe problems is quite telling. In response to KPMG’s report, Mr Pritam Singh breezily says: “AHTC accepts all the recommendations in full”.
 
That’s it. He seems to think that suffices. No need for apologies, explanations, clarifications.
 
He does not explain why AHTC indulged in “highly irregular” practices. He does not explain why there was “failure in (its) control environment”. He doesn’t apologise for the mess, nor account for the “attitudes, awareness and actions of those charged with governance and management” – i.e., AHTC’s political leadership, WP’s six MPs. Is he himself (having already misled the Court of Appeal) in a position to enforce ethical values?
 
Mr Singh’s attitude is consistent with what KPMG in essence said about them: That AHTC’s management has not acted responsibly in dealing with its failings. Where is their sense of responsibility to put things right? Where is their sense of duty, honour and integrity?
 
They went to court to oppose, tooth and nail, the appointment of an independent accountant. We know now why: They don’t want any light shone into their dark corners, of which there are many. This is another subject I will deal with in another post.
 
Mr Singh and his colleagues can’t keep Singaporeans in the dark so easily.
 
•       Many of the problems KPMG identified deal with payments -- running into millions of dollars -- which have already been made. What is Mr Singh and his colleagues going to do about them?
•       Who received the payments and for what purpose? How many of them were genuine? Who amongst your friends benefitted? Why did you use dummy codes for payments – i.e. who really received the payments?
•       For four years, your auditors have been asking for supporting documents. Are you finally going to produce them, or admit that they do not exist?
 
We are still at the early stages in this painful saga. So far KPMG has only looked at the control environment and accounting systems and so on. The Court of Appeal had also directed that the accountants to look into the actual payments that AHTC has made over the years, identify their lawfulness, and where necessary, take steps to recover the payments.
 
Much work remains to be done. More facts will emerge, facts which will show what actually happened to the monies, and what the WP has been up to in Aljunied, Hougang, and for two years Punggol East."

92% of respondents to a public perception survey in 2015 agreed that Singapore has a fair and efficient legal system. They have trust and confidence in the system.
 
Over the last 25 years, our crime rate has come down, from 1,500 crimes for every 100,000 people, to 600 in 2015.

In 2015, we were ranked #1 for personal safety in the Safe Cities Index, out of 50 cities. That includes Tokyo, Osaka, cities which have traditionally been considered among the safest in the world!

-------------------------------------------------------- 
Public officers deal with thousands of members of the public every day, on different issues. They try their best to help. On many such occasions, they need to work with the public to help resolve municipal issues at hand. Most residents are helpful and understanding.
 
And sometimes our public officers are wrong. When that happens they get disciplined.
 
But from time to time, our officers also get verbally abused, with unfair, sarcastic or offensive remarks.
 
Recently a resident wrote to me complaining about rats. Even as the staff from the People’s Association, Town Council and Residents’ Committee tried to help, he continued to write emails peppered with sarcasm to mock them. He seemed to think that he had a right to do so.
 
After mocking them, he then wrote to me in these terms:
 
“Thank you for making wonderful visit (sic) almost every week at Chong Pang Blk 107. Maybe you have been too busy meeting the residents and grassroot members are also blinded by the job to served (sic) as much every week on non essential matters. I would like to share a little secret with you…you have a new family in our neighbourhood and maybe you and your grassroot team would like to meet them personally. I have uploaded a video to introduce themselves to you and maybe you could drop by when you are around next week.’’ He then uploaded a video of some rats. He was being sarcastic, even while acknowledging my regular presence.
 
We responded. I told him that the Town Council was dealing with the problem.
 
I then told the Town Council staff to see him, and explain to him what steps were being taken.
 
He responded as follows:
 
“If your team is so confidence (sic) that it would be able to resolve 90% of the problem I had hightlighted (sic), please join me at 730 am at blk … at lift lobby D.’’
 
The officers contacted him and made an appointment for a Sunday morning at 7.30am. Three Town Council representatives, one RC chairman and one PA staff waited for him.
 
The resident switched off his mobile phone and didn’t turn up without any notice!
 
He deliberately wasted the time of the officers, and the RC volunteer.
 
When he was sent an email setting out his conduct he responded sarcastically – that he will give a further response. But nothing has been heard from him since then.
 
We do our best. Most of the time people understand what we do.
 
But once in a while we come across persons, who behave with nastiness, mocking grass roots leaders who spend countless hours serving the community, and mocking the hard working staff of the Town Council."
203314719715066_1090498864329976,"Drugs destroy Lives – Reflections from a visit to a welfare home
--------------------------------------------------------
 
Some weeks ago, I visited a Home which provides shelter and care for boys who are neglected, abused or homeless, juvenile offenders and those beyond parental control.
 
The boys in the Home, are aged between 10 and 18. There were nearly 70 of them. The majority (about 70%) come from either single parent families (parents either divorced or widowed) or reconstituted families (I.e. they have step-parents and step-siblings).
 
What struck me was that, 30 of the boys (about 45%) come from families where one or both parents were involved in drug abuse. As their parents were embroiled with drugs, many of the boys end up in the care of their elderly grandparents or relatives, or in foster care. The Home took them in when these alternative care arrangements were no longer viable.
 
Sadly, many of these boys do not see much of their parents throughout their growing up years. Some of their parents suffered from serious health issues arising from long-term drug abuse (e.g. cancer, depression), leading to prolonged absence, or even death.
 
“A’’ is one such example. ""A"" never met his dad. His mum could not take care of him due to drug-related offences. He was first placed in foster care when he was 3 years old. He and his mum were only reunited momentarily each time his mum came out of rehab. By 9 years old, ""A"" had been to several different foster families. However, it was difficult for the foster families to continue to care for him.
 
When ""A"" first came to the Home at age 13, he suffered from anger issues and feelings of rejection. Over time and through the Home’s support, he became much calmer and his emotions stabilised. His studies improved. He developed a passion for gardening and art, and spends time tending to the garden in the Home.
 
""A"" always dreamt of the day that he could be with his mum again. However, his hopes were crushed when he received the sad news that his mum had died of cancer. He is now 16 years old. The Home has been the only ‘family’ for him.
 
The boys’ stories remind us how drugs not only destroy the lives of abusers, but affects their loved ones and future generations of Singaporeans.

BBC News reports that there were, in the US:
- 150 mass shootings in 2016 [6 months!]
- 6381 deaths through gun shots in 2016
- 357 million firearms [estimated]
- 101 firearms for every 100 people [estimated]

It is quite tragic that the country is not able to find a way to control guns from reaching madmen, criminals, terrorists and would be mass murderers.

The Wall Street Journal said in a recent article:

“There is no reason why the American public should be able to purchase military-style semiautomatic weapons such as the AR-15, which has become a favorite of mass shooters. 

As retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, one of the leaders of a new veterans' group for gun control, notes, the purpose of the AR-15 is to kill a great many people as quickly as possible. It is also important to ban high-capacity magazines, which allow a killer to keep killing without reloading. 

Mateen used a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle (similar to the AR-15) with a 30-round magazine.

Even if bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines aren't politically possible, Congress should, at a minimum, prevent suspects on terrorism watch lists from purchasing firearms legally -- something that they were able to do 223 times in 2015, according to the Government Accountability Office.""

So even suspects on terrorism watch lists can buy firearms!

Some Congressmen decided to do a sit-in protest in Congress, because they were unable to get gun controls passed into law. Video is below.

Many would have read about the rapist, Brock Turner who got off quite lightly. 

His victim detailed the travails she had to go through. From the sexual assault by her perpetrator to the invasive examination she was put through to collect evidence and the interrogation in court.

The potential maximum punishment for Brock Turner was 14 years in a state prison. He was eventually sentenced to 6 months in a county jail and probation!

The 6-month sentence borders on the absurd.  Cases like this can diminish confidence in the system as a whole.

Any effective criminal justice system must achieve 3 things:
· It must not make it difficult for women to report the crimes.

· It must not put women through unnecessary ordeal during investigations and interrogation in court and should be sensitive to the state of the victims.  

· And when guilt is proven, the punishment for such serious crimes must be commensurate with the gravity of the crime.

I read the young woman’s account of what she had to go through in Court, being subjected to a highly offensive line of questions.  It suggested a complete lack of remorse by Brock Turner.  And his father’s statement, that it was only “20 minutes of action” was something else altogether.

In Singapore, we need to take a strict approach to these sorts of offences.  And we need to work at making it easier for women to report and undergo examination when they have been victims of sexual violence.

We need to do more to educate people against animal cruelty. It's not just the role of government or SPCA. Everyone should play a part. At the same time, we need to be practical in our approach including the Trap, Neuter, and Release Scheme. Culling, is also inevitable when dealing with the aggressive animals, but should always be the last resort. 

Quite happy about the big plans SPCA has for the future. With the larger and better equipped premises, more can be done, including more partnerships to bring the animal welfare community together to advance the movement. 

One such example is the pilot scheme in Chong Pang to allow cats in Housing & Development Board (HDB) flats."

This evening,  I joined the Iftar at Khadijah Mosque.

I was asked by the media about the Orlando shooting incident. I said: The motives of the gunman are not yet clear. Investigations are continuing. But it looks like the gay community has been targeted. This is unacceptable. Violence against any group and any form is not acceptable. Here, the Government will act decisively, if there is threat or violence against anyone or any group.

The Government's duty is to protect everyone. Their race, their religion, their sexual orientation - these are not relevant in terms of the Government’s duty to protect. We have a duty to protect everyone. And I think in this incident, (it) again highlights the threat of terror, whether it's targeted at religious groups or whether it's targeted at specific people, individuals. And we, as Singaporeans, have to come together, unite together to fight this terror.

They started a public piano initiative called Play it Forward Singapore. They want to donate a piano to the Home for the boys.
 
I've asked friends if they know someone who can offer to teach the boys how to read piano notes, and some playing of the piano. Some have expressed interest and we are working out the details.

------------ 
I visited the Muhammadiyah Welfare Home Carnival last Saturday. The Home provides shelter for boys who need some help. I had a  chat with the boys.
 
The boys care a lot about their future – they need the right support. I was impressed by the focus shown by some of the boys, on what they wanted to achieve.
 
An unforgettable experience was when two of the boys performed on the piano for us.
 
The two teenagers – Sha and Remy – were never taught music. They don’t read notes.
 
The piano had been donated to the Home. None of the teachers in the Home could play the piano. They kept the piano in a room .
 
One day, the staff heard beautiful piano music. They went to the room and saw one of the boys playing the piano. They found out that two of them could play the piano – Sha and Remy. They were asked who taught them. The boys said no one taught them, they just “listened to the music many times and ‘tangkap’ (i.e. catch the tune)”. Both boys discovered their hidden talent and passion from the piano.
 
When I visited last week, the two boys confidently played classical and pop pieces for us. They must obviously be musically inclined .
 
Both of them came to the Home because they did not have a stable home environment and there were concerns about their safety and protection. Their performance shows what can be achieved with perseverence, interest.
 
When asked what they want to learn to play next, both boys said emphatically, “I want to learn how to read music notes!”.

At the SCDF Workplan Seminar recently, I met 4 people who are true heroes, while leading normal lives:

• Ms Michelle Lim saved a life. She is a resident in Bishan. She had volunteered to be trained in first aid, and use of AED for resuscitation. She was alerted by the SCDF myResponder app, on 3 January 2016 to a cardiac arrest case. She was having breakfast at her neighbourhood coffeeshop in her flat at that time. She rushed to the scene and performed CPR on the casualty until SCDF paramedics arrived.

• Mr Nay Zar Kyaw Min was driving when he saw an elderly Chinese lady lying in a pool of blood by the roadside. Mr Nay, who was trained under SCDF’s Community Emergency Preparedness Programme, immediately got out of his car to administer first-aid to the elderly lady while waiting for the arrival of SCDF paramedics. He also saved a life.

• Mr Mazlan, a taxi driver, was driving when he spotted a car on fire on the road. Together with another taxi driver, they used fire extinguishers from their taxis to put out the fire.

• Mr Simon Chan, a taxi driver, responded to a myResponder app alert. He rushed an AED in his taxi to the scene at Changi Airport Terminal 2 to aid the victim.

I asked Simon – what made him respond. He said he was in SCDF during his NS days, and wanted to help. Likewise the others – they said the same thing. A passion to learn what to do in an emergency, and a willingness to save lives.

They are true heroes, helping to look out for the safety of others.

Radicalisation is sweeping through the world. Hundreds have been arrested in Malaysia, including special forces, military officers and police officers. About a thousand have gone from Malaysia and Indonesia to fight with ISIS in the Middle East. We have also detained Singaporeans who had been radicalised.
 
As for immigration vetting of foreign workers – how would that pick up people who only become radicalised after they come here?  And even those who have some radical leanings before they come in – how would we know what is in their minds, unless they had gone public with those ideas?
 
We have tens of thousands of Bangladeshi workers in Singapore, doing tough jobs in the construction and marine industries, and in other areas, including our Town Councils. The vast majority are peaceful, here to work hard. We send them back – who will do their jobs ?

He enjoys what he's doing, and happy here in Nee Soon because the people here are friendly and supportive towards him. He hopes to continue with this even after he enters university.
 
Wishing Zhi Ming and his friend every success!

203314719715066_1030278707018659,"On 28 March, I was invited to speak to Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU) students and faculty at the Ministerial Forum 2016 on ""Progressing Towards #SG100"". I shared about Singapore’s future challenges, such as the need for financial prudence amidst higher social spending, our low birth rates and rapidly ageing population, global and regional competition and, of course, terrorism.
 
The students asked good questions during Q&A.
 
One student asked how we can ensure that Singapore continues to have good leaders in the future.
 
My reply was that we cannot rely on our laws to guarantee good leadership. Singapore was very fortunate that Mr #LeeKuanYew and his team of leaders had all the key ingredients for success – they were men of outstanding integrity, extremely competent, with vision. They worked for the best interests of Singaporeans. They did what was right instead of what was popular.
 
Whether Singapore continues to have good leaders will ultimately depend on our young people. Whether they will rise up to the challenge, and serve their fellow Singaporeans with integrity and excellence.
 
I have a lot of faith in Singapore’s youth, and I believe our young people have what it takes to make Singapore successful."

Her family has been living in Nee Soon for 20 years. Her children are grown up. Both have graduated. One child is working with MINDEF and the other child works in an MNC. 

Her family's story is a classic Singaporean one - of social mobility. A chart showing how we do on social mobility compared with some other countries, is attached. We must ensure that social mobility remains high.

People have asked me if this was an Islamophobic attack. I had specifically warned about Islamophobia, on Wednesday (March 30) - two days before this incident. It can be a cancer that destroys the soul of our country. We cannot tolerate that and MHA will act.

In this case, we do not know the detailed facts, the motives, and should wait for the investigations to be completed. We should avoid speculation on the motives.

MAN ARRESTED FOR INCIDENT AT PAYA LEBAR MRT STATION 

On 1 April 2016 at about 7.35am, the Police were informed of a case where a man caused hurt to three female students of Madrasah Al Maarif Al Islamiah in three separate incidents at the vicinity of Paya Lebar MRT station. The students, aged 14 to 16, were on their separate ways to the madrasah when the man caused hurt to them. The Police have arrested a 48-year-old Singaporean Chinese man, in connection with the case. Police investigations are still ongoing.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Investigations & Intelligence) concurrent Director of the Criminal Investigation Department, Tan Chye Hee said, “The Police take a stern view of acts that could threaten the racial and religious harmony in Singapore. Any person who caused hurt to others on the basis of their race or religion will be dealt with severely in accordance with the law."
203314719715066_1025694340810429,"I have been told of three Madrasah students being physically attacked today in a public place. At this point, the motives for the attack are not clear.

I have asked the Police to investigate the matter. We will get to the bottom of it and ensure that justice is done."
203314719715066_1025452450834618,"I spent some time earlier this week thanking ISD officers who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to keep Singaporeans safe – they are at the front line of dealing with our counter terrorism efforts.
 
I also visited the Battle for Merger exhibition at the National Library, Singapore which gave insights to Singapore’s fight against the Communism threat in our early years. One of the exhibits was our founding Prime Minister Mr #LeeKuanYew Colt Cobra, which was issued to him for self-protection during Singapore’s tumultuous years of nation-building.     
 
As with the previous threat of communist violence and subversion which lasted four decades, the current terrorism threat, which is ideologically-driven, will last for a long time. We need to be prepared as a society – vigilant, united and strong."

______________________________

Learnt with considerable sadness that Johan Cruyff has passed away. 

Cruyff and his Dutch teammates were peerless. They played amazing football. Cruyff was the Dutch captain in the first live game I watched - the 1974 World Cup Final between Holland  and West Germany. 

It was an exciting game, and is etched vividly in my memory. The Dutch scoring pretty much in the first minute. 

The Germans (as they almost always do) coming back to score two goals, one of which through Gerd Muller.

And then wave after wave of Dutch attacks in the second half - all stopped with the redoubtable Sepp Maier in form as goalkeeper. 

Johan Cruyff was a magician with the ball. He will live in the memories of many of us.

During the Mass, the church also commemorated the 3rd Anniversary of the election of the Holy Father Pope Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013.
 
Pope Francis has exemplified love and compassion for all, especially the less fortunate and marginalised in society. He has been a strong proponent of inter-faith dialogue and understanding. He has been a remarkable Pope.
 
I consider it one of my true blessings in my life to have met the Holy Father last year, when I visited the Vatican City. 
 
After Mass, I was invited to address the congregation. I touched on the significant efforts by the Catholic community in Singapore to promote social and charitable causes, and thanked the Catholics for touching lives and helping to make the world a better place.

203314719715066_1013990521980811,"Our Response to Terrorism
____________________________


Today, I outlined the way we will respond to terror. I made two major points:

First is that of our security response. We will increase our security forces and emergency response teams. They will have to deal with the evolving nature of threats. Their weapons will be upgraded and they will be trained to arrive quickly and take down the attackers. Their response has to be swift and effective.

Second point I made is that security will now have to be the concern of every Singaporean. It cannot be something to be dealt with just by our security forces. We will need the entire community to come together to deal with any attacks and the aftermath of an attack.

We will further develop all of that into a new national strategy – SGSecure.

This is a fight between freedom and terror.
A fight ultimately between good and evil.

They were meeting at a mosque on a regular basis. I sometimes walk past this mosque. 

They had materials on techniques of silent killing (picture attached) and videos on jihadist propaganda (link below). The video showed young children training overseas with firearms.

While they were planning attacks outside Singapore, they could have easily changed their minds and attacked Singapore.

Our security agencies have done well in picking them up early. I had said yesterday that the threat of terrorism is real. We are getting daily reminders of that.

203314719715066_975377939175403,"Cat cruelty in Yishun. And a question of moral duty
---------- 
For several weeks many of us have been horrified by the appalling cruelty, in the mutilation and killing of many cats in Yishun.  Shocking, sickening. I encouraged my colleague, Louis Ng Kok Kwang to lead community efforts to deal with the situation, even as the police and the AVA were doing their best. I, like many others, was keen that the culprit(s) should be caught and the full weight of the law should be applied to them.
 
The investigations by the authorities zeroed in on a suspect. On Tuesday, 29 Dec 2015, one Mr Lee Wai Leong was charged in court. Many people were relieved that someone apparently responsible had been charged.
 
One of my volunteers subsequently told me that Mr Lee’s family broke down in court. They spoke to my volunteers, told him that they were unsure of the charges and the next steps. They also shared with my volunteers, Mr Lee’s medical condition. They said that he had the mentality of a kid, suffers from epilepsy fits and seizures that occur almost on a daily basis. He gives monosyllabic answers to questions. He does not work. He never went beyond P4, and was exempted from NS because of his medical condition. He gets treatment at KTPH.
 
The family lives in my constituency. Mr Lee’s father is the sole bread winner. The aged parents of Mr Lee are very worried and spoke with my volunteers, and pleaded for help. They said that they cannot afford to engage a lawyer and asked for help to get a lawyer.  
 
Some people heard about this and advised me that we should not help Mr Lee get a lawyer. They said that the public will misunderstand and think we are helping a cruel cat killer, and (by extension) that we support cruelty to animals. They are good, well-meaning people, who were genuinely concerned for me, and my volunteers.
 
I thought about this – in my mind, (based on what the parents have said) it was and is very clear that my duty is to help Mr Lee get a lawyer.  The court can then get all the facts and decide on the question of whether he is guilty, as well as the appropriate sentence, if (with emphasis), he is found guilty.
 
I believe that Singaporeans (including all those who were angry and appalled by the cruelty done to the cats) are at heart generous people, and will understand why we are helping to get a lawyer to act pro bono for Mr Lee. It is the right thing to do (with emphasis) in the circumstances. I don’t think people will therefore assume that I or the lawyer condone cruelty to animals. Far from it.

I have asked Josephus Tan, a lawyer who helps in my branch, if he will help Mr Lee. Josephus has agreed.
 
I would also suggest that pending the trial, we should refrain from coming to conclusions. We should leave matters to the court. The key thing is that the person(s) responsible for the killings should be identified and stopped; and should face the punishment according to the law. If someone is mentally unsound, then that is a matter to be proven in court, and for the court to consider in deciding on what to do.

MINISTER’S 2015 YEAR-END MESSAGE TO THE HOME TEAM

2015 will come to a close soon. I would like to convey my appreciation and commendation to all officers of the Home Team for your good work in keeping Singapore safe and secure. Your hard work and dedication to your mission have collectively kept Singapore one of the safest countries in the world. 

2. This year, Singapore’s Golden Jubilee, has been challenging and intense for the Home Team. You have contributed to the safety and security of the many national events throughout the year. These included the National Mourning for our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Southeast Asia Games, the Jubilee Weekend Celebrations and the General Election. Because of you, these events proceeded smoothly and Singaporeans were able to attend and participate in them safely. 

3. It has also been a busy year for the Home Team with the introduction of several new laws, namely, the Liquor Control (Supply & Consumption) Act, the Organised Crime Act and the Remote Gambling Act. These laws will strengthen our capabilities to maintain public order and suppress crime. 

4. Across the Home Team, new initiatives were introduced to ensure that we remained on top of an increasingly challenging environment. The introduction of the Integrated Checkpoints Command was a major shift in the way we operated at our checkpoints, bringing the various Home Team agencies under a single unified command for better operational efficiency and responsiveness. The Police achieved a milestone in its frontline policing strategy when it completed the implementation of the Community Policing System at all 35 Neighbourhood Police Centres this year.  

5. We have strengthened our community partnerships, by enabling the public to take greater ownership of safety and security outcomes. New initiatives implemented include the SCDF’s Save-A-Life initiative and MyResponder mobile app, the Police’s Vehicles-on-Watch project and the joint SCDF-Police Neighbourhood Active Responder (NEAR) Programme. In preventive education against drugs, following the recommendations of the Task Force on Youths and Drugs, an enhanced toolkit for teachers and youth counsellors was launched. On the rehabilitation front, our Yellow Ribbon Project has inspired similar movements in other countries, such as the US, Australia and the Philippines. 

6. The Home Team also participated actively in overseas operations, most notably during the Nepal and Sabah earthquakes and the haze crisis in Indonesia.  

7. Throughout a very challenging SG50 year, the Home Team has worked hard to deliver our mission, demonstrating strong operational excellence and preparedness. But we continue to face the threat of terrorism, especially from self-radicalised individuals. We also face international pressure against some of our policies, especially on drugs. Social norms are evolving and public expectations of the Home Team are increasing. Singapore’s changing demographics, with an ageing population and a local workforce that will stop growing in the near future, will impact on our operational resources.  We will need to rise up to these challenges.  

8. MHA has secured a multi-year resourcing arrangement from the Ministry of Finance, which will ensure that the Home Team is adequately resourced for the next few years. This certainty of resources allows us to make long term strategic plans. The Home Team has started on a transformational journey to plan ahead and develop new ways of doing our work in order to better tackle our challenges. We will enhance operational integration across the Home Team and systematically build up our capabilities. We will maximise the potential of our officers and leverage technology so that we can do more with less. And we will continue to enhance community partnerships so that the people of Singapore can contribute more to their own safety and security. 

9. I am privileged to have the opportunity to serve once more with the dedicated men and women of the Home Team. Thank you for your service and commitment to our mission, and your resolve in upholding our values of Honour and Unity. You are truly the Guardians of Singapore.

10. I wish all officers of the Home Team and your families the very best for the New Year ahead.

Some media reports had inaccurately given the impression that the re-arrest goes against the judgment delivered by the Court of Appeal. That is not so. 

If the Government feels that the judgment of a court, on a piece of legislation, does not accord with government's policy objectives, then the right approach is to go to Parliament to change the law. 

This is fundamental because the Judiciary and Civil Service are key institutions, and we need to respect and uphold their status. 
 
In this case, the court accepted that illegal match fixing could come within the CLTPA. The Court of Appeal however said that the Detention Order issued against Dan Tan did not comply with the requirements of the Act, and did not adequately set out the grounds which justified the detention.
 
The Government accepts and respects the Court of Appeal’s judgement. 
 
The police have arrested Dan Tan for investigations. If he is detained under the CLTPA, the Detention Order will set out the grounds in full, as advised by AGC, and will comply with the terms of the Judgement."

Our deepest sympathies to the victims of the Paris attacks, and their families and loved ones. In this difficult time, our thoughts are with the French people. We pray for their recovery and that they will emerge stronger as a community.

These attacks show that no country is immune, even when there is a state of heightened security. In Singapore, today, we have raised our alert level. We have stepped up security measures, border checks and vigilance. 

Together, everyone plays a part to keep Singapore safe and secure. We encourage everyone to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities or persons to the authorities. 

Such attacks aim to strike fear in the community. We must therefore continue to build up our social resilience. This will ensure that if an incident were to occur here, we will stand together, recover quickly and emerge stronger and more united."

Mr Schmidt and Mr Lee had deep mutual admiration for each other. Both were sharp and tough. They were able to take pragmatic and strategic view of global developments. Mr Lee had once described the German leader as “a tough and intelligent leader able to identify the important issues in any given complicated situation’’. Mr Schmidt described Mr Lee’s last book as “the most valuable guidance for the 21st century world’s complexity’’.

---------- 
Mr Lee’s words above were quoted by former MFA Permanent Secretary Bilahari Kausikan, in a speech he made in Cambridge, recently.
 
Bilahari points out the harsh realities of our foreign policy and Singapore’s vulnerable position in the region. He paid tribute to our founding leaders Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Keng Swee and S Rajaratnam whose steady hands helped navigate us through some turbulent and dangerous times in the early years.

For small nations, in Bilahari’s words, foreign policy is usually about a series of “not always neat or consistent improvisations to a messy and unpredictable reality’’.
 
Diplomacy is not all about being pleasant or making oneself agreeable. It’s about defending and advancing Singapore’s interests, preferably by being pleasant and agreeable but if necessary “by any appropriate means’’.
 
Idealism is important. But all idealism must be rooted in a hard-headed understanding of human nature and power. “Without power nothing can be achieved. And even with power not everything desirable will always be feasible.’’ 
 
In his speech, Bilahari recalled how our founding PM once told a former chief of the Malaysian Armed Force that “if PAS comes into power…and tries to meddle with the water in Johor Bahru, I’ll move my troops in. I will not wait for the Security Council to solve this little problem’’.
 
Singapore has done well in the five decades since independence. As a nation, we cannot be ordinary if we want to be relevant to the world.

------------ 
Last Saturday, I attended nine events in and around the GRC.
 
I visited the Hindu Endowment Board-Ashram, a halfway house to launch their #SG50 Gift of Heart programme to distribute goodie bags to 500 former and current residents of the home. Also launched their corporate video.
 
Lunch was spent together with a group of doctors, professionals and educators. We discussed a wide range of topics ranging from education to welfare for the needy and disadvantage.
 
After lunch, I joined the volunteers of the Chong Pang Meet-the-People Session (MPS) at their retreat. They were actively coming up with new ideas to improve the whole MPS experience for our residents. Heartened to see everyone focused on serving and helping our residents.
 
In the late afternoon, I attended the wedding of Mr Ferhan Sahib Bin Amir Sahib and Ms Nor Azizah Binte Abdul Hyoom at Blk 128 and then headed to a Floor Party at Blk 120 in Chong Pang. Subsequently visited the home of one of our grassroots leaders living in Sembawang.
 
Returned to  Chong Pang CC and did a walkabout in the area before settling down to a quick meal at Blk 101 Coffeeshop just opposite Chong Pang Camp. It was followed by a walkabout at Chong Pang Hawker Centre.
 
Rounded up the day attending Jing Long Lion Arts Association's 30th anniversary dinner. They hosted over 75 tables of guests, including overseas participants. Managed to go round to every table to say hi. Enjoyed the vibrant atmosphere.

--------------------
On 6 Oct 2015, a 4 year-old boy fell to his death in Yishun. He apparently fell from an open window in his flat. It was a tragic accident. It could have been prevented if there had been window grilles.

The family had just moved into the flat. The father of the child says that the contractor was supposed to do a number of works, including installing the window grilles.

The family’s move-in date had already been delayed for eight days by the contractor. When the family moved in, some of the agreed items had not been installed, including the window grilles.

Attempts to contact the contractor were not successful.

The father was particularly concerned about the window grilles as he had young children. He told the contractor this, and exchanged WhatsApp messages with the contractor. The contractor had removed the previous grilles but did not install new ones!.

According to the father, when he finally suggested to terminate the contract, the contractor asked to meet him, but did not turn up at the agreed date and time!

After a few days, the contractor contacted him to say that his company will send a cancellation letter. The letter never arrived.

The window grilles were not installed and the tragedy happened. 

The father attempted to contact the contractor, sent him the news reports of his son’s death – and no response from the contractor. No apology, no visit, and the father thinks the contractor has even blocked him, from messaging the contractor.

If these facts are true, then the conduct is shameful, irresponsible and has contributed to the tragedy.

One can understand the parents’ anger, anguish. To lose a child like this. Because someone has not done what he is supposed to have done. And the conduct after the tragedy is shocking.

When I visited the family, the parents were stoic. They recounted the story without rancour. I was quite upset.

There must be steps taken against such contractors – if what the father says is correct. We must help the family to get legal recourse. It wont bring back the child, but there has to be some justice done. I have told them we will help find a lawyer for the family.

----------
I became Foreign Minister, in May 2011. In the past four-and-a-half years, the external environment has become much more challenging for Singapore. Nevertheless, we have been able to maintain and enhance Singapore’s role in the region as well as the rest of the world. This has been possible because MFA officers are highly professional, extremely passionate about Singapore’s interests.  They defend, protect Singapore fiercely. I enjoyed the work, and enjoyed working with our officers.
 
Dr Vivian Balakrishnan will take over from me. He will no doubt enjoy the same excellent support that I received. I wish him well in spearheading our diplomatic efforts. 

I had previously spent three years in MHA, from May 2008 to May 2011: Two plus years as 2nd Minister and about eight months as Minister, Home Affairs. 

The responsibilities at MHA are both serious and heavy – ranging from law and order (police related), prisons, immigration, to border issues, internal security, dealing with terrorism, and much more. 

I had been fully immersed in the work before I had left in May 2011, and found it both challenging and meaningful – each day you are dealing with the safety and security of Singaporeans. The officers I worked with were exceptional in their ability and their dedication.

----

Walked around Chong Pang this morning. The haze was in the unhealthy range, and there were much fewer people out on the streets than usual. I saw many wearing masks. As I walked around, the impact of the haze, on people, was obvious. I was coughing, eyes itching, the heat oppressive. Our senior citizens must be feeling much worse.

My Security Officer took some photos of the CTE, as I was driving. They show what the conditions were like this morning. And tonight, the haze reached hazardous levels.

A close friend told me her elderly parents are suffering a lot because of the haze. One of my grassroots leaders told me that his family had to stay indoors with all windows shut. Many other Singaporeans tell me similar things when I meet them, and they want the haze problem solved for good.

The Singapore government takes the matter seriously. We stand ready to assist Indonesia in combatting the fires. Last year, we introduced legislation to allow us to prosecute companies found to be causing or contributing to the haze. And we will not hesitate to take such actions against those errant companies.

The Indonesian government has said that it is taking steps to deal with the problem. We hope those steps will lead to lasting outcomes, and we are prepared with work with Indonesia on this.  

Yet at the same time, we are hearing some shocking statements made, at senior levels, from Indonesia, with a complete disregard for our people, and their own – PSI levels in parts of Indonesia are at almost 2,000 (PSI above 350 is considered hazardous in Indonesia).

How is it possible for senior people in government to issue such statements, without any regard for their people, or ours, and without any embarrassment, or sense of responsibility?"

---------------
I joined the Bone Marrow Donor Programme (Singapore) (BMDP) campaign on Saturday. It was held in conjunction with World Marrow Donor Day - WMDD.
 
Over 2000 people in Singapore are diagnosed with a blood disease every year. A bone marrow transplant can save them. The process does not require surgery . 
 
The procedure is simple. Signing-up is easy as well with just a two minutes cheek swab.
 
During the campaign, many people signed up with the donor register. This will help BMDP match more patients to potential donors.
 
However, the register needs more Malay, Indian and mixed ethnic donors, due to genetic similarities. This is important and beneficial for our Malay, Indian and mixed ethnic patients.
 
Also visited their volunteers who were '""living statues"" along Orchard Road. They represent how life can come to a standstill for a patient diagnosed with a blood disease. We can do our part to help.

Special thanks to Jane Prior and her team – proof that a small group with drive and energy can make so much difference to the rest of the community..

-----

Singaporeans are frustrated with the haze. Understandably so.

Year after year, the haze continues to recur.

The pollution affects not just the people of Singapore. The worst affected are the Indonesian people who are closest to the fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan.

It is a health hazard – especially to the young, the elderly, and those with chronic lung and heart conditions.

Regional economies are also affected. The 1997 haze cost Southeast Asia an estimated US$9 billion. The potential loss to Riau’s economy this year has been estimated at around 8% of the province’s GDP – some Rp20 trillion (around US$1.3 billion).

The frustration of our people is all the greater because the haze can be prevented. The majority of the fires are man-made, by companies seeking to profit while people pay the costs.

There is only so much that we can do here in Singapore to stop the fires as they are in another country. We have offered assistance to help fight the fires (including this year, but our offer has yet to be accepted). We passed a bill in August 2014 that would allow us to prosecute errant companies found to be causing or contributing to the haze. We have asked Indonesia to give us the names of the companies so that we can consider if we can take action against them.

Indonesia too has a responsibility to take legal and enforcement action against errant companies since these companies violate Indonesia’s own laws.

This year, the Indonesian government has declared a state of emergency and has deployed troops and assets to deal with the haze. Companies are reportedly being prosecuted. These are positive steps.

I spoke with Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi on Friday and expressed our deep concern. A longer-term solution was necessary, and Singapore wanted to work with regional countries, including Indonesia, on this. We have over the years, raised the issue at ASEAN, the UN, and other fora. We have suggested ways in which regional countries can cooperate. There has however been no concrete progress. The international community is looking at how we deal with the problem. A lasting solution is needed. Our people expect that. And understandably so."

203314719715066_919561871423677,"I have been asked about a Facebook post by Ms Thanapal regarding my comments at a Singapore Press Club event on 27 August 2015. She unfortunately twisted what I had said and suggested that I was an “Islamaphobic bigot who thinks Malay-Muslims are a threat”.

I had not said anything like that.

I spoke about the issue of integration in the Malaysian education system. The key points I wanted to convey were:

1)       The Chinese leadership in various local areas in Malaysia want to maintain control over the Chinese population. It suits them to have Chinese students go to Chinese schools instead of mainstream Malaysian schools. And the schools are more Chinese (because they are effectively single race).

2)       At the same time, many mainstream schools in Malaysia are becoming more Malay (because the students are largely Malay) and Islamic (e.g. through the way some principals and teachers handle matters) which discourages the Chinese from going into those schools.

3)       So you end up with having more Malays going to mainstream schools, and more Chinese going to Chinese schools. As a result, the different races are kept apart from a young age.

4)       This makes integration more difficult.

My point therefore was essentially that this is the predominant situation in the Malaysian education system. This is not good for integration.

The video clip of the news carried the essence of what I said, and this is also evident from the transcript of what I said.

What Ms Thanapal wrote is inaccurate and seditious, and attributes to me sentiments that I do not hold and have never held.

I intend to file a police report about this tomorrow."

Bee Wah is one of the most outspoken MPs in Parliament. She fights fearlessly for residents and doesn’t let go of any problem until a solution is found. She has done much for the constituency.

I met Henry in 2009 and he has been helping me since 2010. He’s good in dealing with people. He was my branch secretary, and after several years of working with him, observing him, I decided that he is good MP material and asked him to become a candidate. Henry is wth Kebun Baru.

Louis is well-known as an activist. He started animal welfare group ACRES in 2001 when he was still an undergrad. As an activist, he is strong in working, engaging and motivating people. He is very focused on building communities based on interests and building bonds. I have worked with him for several years, and after assessing him, asked him to become a candidate.

- non-disclosure of related party transactions; and 
- reliability of their own accounts on S&CC collected and the amount owed to them after a few years.

They are good politicians, good at  campaigning, political angling, making rally speeches full of fire and brimstone, making promises.

-----------------------------------------
I was in Kuala Lumpur earlier this week for the 48th ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and Related Meetings.
 
The Meetings were held in Putra World Trade Centre.  It is an UMNO building which has a long series of murals capturing parts of Malaysian history.
 
These murals are quite famous.  One of the murals depicts Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the Separation.
 
One of my officers said that in many ways, the mural captures some Malaysian perspective on Singapore.
 
The mural shows an angry Tunku pointing a finger, telling Mr Lee to go.  The Tunku is portrayed in heroic terms towering over Mr Lee.
 
My officer said that Mr Lee was portrayed almost like a devious person, slinking away with Singapore.
 
I was not so sure. Another perspective could be that it showed Mr Lee as being scared and worried as he walked away with Singapore, after being booted out.
 
Interesting to reflect on the different perspectives.  And interesting to speculate what our lives would be like if Singapore was still part of Malaysia today.
 
As we celebrate #SG50, I think most Singaporeans believe that Independence has been good for Singaporeans.

We remember Mr Lee and his steadfastness and commitment to Singapore.  Truly, we will not be here, without him and his exceptional team.  For us he is a true hero.

Cecil was an iconic animal, majestic and much loved. Media reports say he was a ‘local favourite’ and famous in Zimbabwe. With his black fringed mane, he was a popular attraction in the National Park. He has been noticed and his movements have been followed since 2008.  He has been the subject of an Oxford study.

Cecil was killed in tragic circumstances by man, as blood sport. He was lured out of the National Park with a bait. An American dentist, shot him with a bow and arrow – for sport. Cecil was then left  to suffer for 40 hours before being gunned down. Cecil was then beheaded and skinned.

I don’t want to comment on whether the dentist did or did not believe that he had the necessary permits to do this hunting. 

My point is more basic. I find the circumstances of this killing quite unacceptable, barbarous. Cecil was lured out of his safe habitat. Baited out. Shot. Left to suffer. Then beheaded and skinned. And if one wants to truly engage in blood sport, then why use weapons, whether bow and arrow or guns? Does the animal have a chance? 

The dentist could perhaps have considered engaging in combat unarmed if he really felt that he wanted to test himself against a lion. That would be some test.

Poor Cecil.

--------

In the early years of Singapore’s independence, we benefitted tremendously from the help of friends from around the world.  

And so, we established the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) in 1992. It is a way for us to give back to the international community by sharing our development experience. It is also a way for us to build friendships with other countries. Over the years, we have welcomed many government officials from abroad who visit Singapore on the SCP.

Today marks a significant milestone for the SCP – we received our 100,000th participant! She is Mrs Shelley Nicholls-Hunte, and she works in the Attorney-General’s Office in Barbados. Sharing a photo I took with her earlier this afternoon.

_____________________
 
The past weeks have been painful for many of us. Ten Singaporean lives were lost on the slopes of Mount Kinabalu, 10 too many.
 
While we grieve, we salute the children, who displayed extraordinary courage and fortitude beyond their years in weathering this disaster, as well as the heroic acts of the teachers and mountain guides, some of whom sacrificed their lives to protect others.
 
Mr Mohamed Faizal and other teachers used their own bodies to shield students as boulders rained down. Despite sustaining injuries themselves, the teachers continued to put the safety and welfare of their students ahead of theirs. For Mr Terrence Loo and Mr Mohammad Ghazi, their last moments were defined by their selflessness and courage in attempting to save more students.
 
We also thank the Malaysian mountain guides who risked life and limb to guide climbers to safety during and after the earthquake. Their efforts prevented the fatality count from going higher. Sadly, Mr Valerian Joannes, Mr Robbi Sapinggi and other guides lost their lives in the line of duty.
           
As we unite as a nation to mourn, let us recall the heroism displayed. Their actions are a tribute to the departed, and an inspiration to us.

The situation in Yemen has worsened. MFA has issued three advisories so far, advising Singaporeans to leave.

Singapore has worked with many other countries - China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Oman and the Philippines - to get over 20 of our citizens out of Yemen.

Last Saturday, MFA deployed a Crisis Response Team in Oman. With the assistance of the Omani government and others, we got another eight citizens out.

These operations are complex, and we don’t have an Embassy on the ground.

Despite the obvious risks, there are still over 40 of our citizens in Yemen. MFA is contacting their next-of-kin to persuade them to advise their loved ones to try and leave.

The government has a duty to try and help our citizens in situations like this. At the same time, people have an individual personal responsibility not to put themselves at risk. The longer they continue to be there, the more they are putting themselves at risk, and the more difficult it becomes for any sort of rescue operations to be conducted.

We can draw some lessons from the situation in Syria – despite many MFA advisories, some of our people did not leave Syria in time. They eventually found all their escape routes cut off, making exit extremely difficult.

Many foreign Embassies in Yemen have closed down. Foreign countries are winding down their rescue operations. This limits our own ability to do much more in Yemen.

His appointment strengthens our MFA work.

The world is shrinking, and our interests around the world, economic, political, have grown. We need to engage many countries actively, much more so than we have had to.

In the past, Masagos has been focusing on Africa, Middle-East, South Asia, Central Asia and Latin America. These regions offer opportunities for Singapore companies to participate in their economic development. And many countries in these regions want to link up with Singapore.

He also works closely with the MFA team to strengthen existing relationships with our neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia. He makes frequent trips to these countries.

Masagos has promoted Singapore at every opportunity, and has been very good for us. We are fortunate at MFA to have Masagos with us. With his promotion, I will now be able to give him even more responsibilities, at MFA.

203314719715066_856052574441274,"An article by BBC on the enormous challenges facing Japan as her population ages rapidly. The country is grappling with what are the politically acceptable solutions to provide healthcare and other services to not just the elderly but also the economy. 

The dire situation and the difficulty in tackling the population issue is something we will soon face ourselves.  Singapore is  one of the fastest aging societies in the world.

Today, more than a quarter of Japan's population is aged over 65. This is set to rise to 40 per cent by 2055, when the population will have shrunk from the current 127 million to 90 million. The Japanese government has warned that Japan will need to add one million nurses and care workers by 2025. 

The report looks at the harsh economic and social realities of family members looking after their aged relatives.

Likewise in Singapore, we have a  ratio of six working adults to one person above 65 today. In 15 years, it is projected that we will only have two working adults for one person above 65. Our Manpower Ministry predicts that the number of people entering the workforce is going to come down sharply in 4 years. 

This year 95,000 people will enter the workforce. By 2019, only 20,000 will be entering the workforce. These are  serious issues.

On Japan, the BBC report noted encouraging immigration may seem like a simple solution - but it's not a popular one. Japan is a highly homogenous society and has always struggled with absorbing foreigners into society. It said the service industry, which hires foreign students as part-time employees, also received harsh feedback, especially at the beginning, from those unused to dealing with foreigners.

The report is worth a read. And for us to reflect.

People from all walks of life – the disabled, men on crutches, some with one leg, elderly on canes and wheelchairs, ladies (young and old) sobbing inconsolably, strangers hugging one another, young students and volunteers offering drinks to the people, restaurants offering free bottled water and snacks to those in the queues.
 
Some queued for 8 hours but that wasn’t going to stop them from saying goodbye to Mr Lee. 
 
I spent yesterday (except when I had to go for two meetings) around Parliament, speaking with and thanking our people who had come to pay their respect to Mr Lee.  
 
Around 1.30am, outside Parliament, I was still being approached by large numbers of people offering their condolences.  Many shared their impressions and encounters with Mr Lee.  Their emotions were obvious.  One lady told me that she works in the UK.  She didn’t come back for relatives passing away.  But she came back for Mr Lee.  Many stories of people making special effort to come and pay the respect to Mr Lee.  
 
People asked me if I will be there today.  I told them I will, except when I have to go for meetings.  Today, tomorrow and Saturday.
 
People were very encouraging and supportive.  
 
For the friends who have commented (both personally and on my FB) that I looked very tired and my voice was very tired: true.  I was very tired.

203314719715066_850349731678225,"Mr Lee is no more.

I am tearing as I write this.

What is there to say about Mr Lee Kuan Yew that has not already been said?

On the broad canvas that Mr Lee made, millions of good life stories were written in Singapore.

Mr Lee made these life stories possible: People who started out with almost nothing and moved up to better lives, better jobs, better flats.

In this small city, with peace, harmony and security.

My life story is in many ways the life story of many Singaporeans.

I was born in March 1959. Mr Lee and the PAP first won elections in May 1959, two months after I was born.

Like most Singaporeans, I was a direct beneficiary of Mr Lee’s policies. These policies created a society based on meritocracy, equal opportunities, clean and efficient government, good education for all.

My family had no social capital and very little economic capital.

Mr Lee and his policies ensured that neither my background nor the colour of my skin, nor my religion, were hurdles in getting opportunities. I got a good education in a neighbourhood primary school, got into RI, got into law school and had no difficulty getting a job. 

My family moved to a 3-room flat in 1975 – our first property. And we upgraded after that.

My brother and I graduated. We were able to give a good upbringing to our children.

This story, in broad terms is the story of Singapore, and the story of most Singaporeans – in that many of us started with very little, but all of us were all offered good educational opportunities, decent jobs and better housing.

The vast majority of Singaporeans benefitted. How well we did, and where we ended up, depended on individual effort and some luck.

Singapore is almost unique in the post-World War II world in having started so poor and succeeding so well.
 
Mr Lee and his team made that possible.

His intellect, fervour and passion for Singapore and Singaporeans won him the respect of global leaders like Richard Nixon, Deng Xiaoping, George H W Bush, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Tony Blair, Margaret Thatcher and other world leaders.

Mr Lee has been described by global leaders as “the preeminent elder statesman of our generation,” a strategic thinker, a political mastermind, an individual with “a steadfast voice of reason, clarity and hope.”

He put Singapore on the world map.

I first met Mr Lee when I was 28. He was amongst those who interviewed me before deciding to field me as a candidate for elections. He questioned me on a variety of topics for 45 minutes. It was an unforgettable experience.

Over the years, I have dealt with him on different issues.

The Mr Lee I dealt with was a practical, no-nonsense man. His sharp intellect meant going straight to the heart of any issue. There was no small talk or superficiality. Every breathing moment for him was spent thinking about Singapore and Singaporeans. There was an unwavering tenacity to ensure that Singapore succeeded.

I had never imagined a Singapore without Mr Lee. 

But as he lay in hospital, on life support, I began to think of what I had never wanted to accept: that we are likely to lose Mr Lee.

Each time I think about him now, I tear. Each time I read a tribute to him, I choke. It is difficult to describe in words, the grief I feel.

Mr Lee himself was matter-of-fact about death: He said: “I am not given to making sense out of life – or coming up with some grand narrative on it – other than to measure it by what you think you want to do in life. As for me, I have done what I had wanted to, to the best of my ability. I am satisfied.”

Everywhere you turn: from the housing estates, the clean and efficient roads, the corruption-free system, the schools, the world-class universities, the leading financial centre that we are today, the good jobs and good quality of life our people have, the hospitals, the clean green environment, the vibrancy of this metropolis, the fact that it is now one of the great cities of the world with a GDP almost equal to that of Malaysia, a much bigger country, with a bigger population and a huge amount of resources. Mr Lee was the chief architect of the system that produced all of this. Mr Lee oversaw the transformation of Singapore.

Very few have made so much difference to so many in so little time.

No one else has built a country out of almost nothing, and in the face of so much adversity.

Singapore without Mr Lee Kuan Yew will never be the same.

Mr Lee’s speeches are full of passion and very inspiring. I included clips that feature such speeches by Mr Lee.

May God bless his soul.

I focused on three areas: helping litigants, improvements to the family justice system and our efforts in helping Singapore law practices to expand regionally.
 
Helping litigants
 
The government will play a bigger role in criminal legal aid. We are enhancing the Law Society’s Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. More people will be able to receive more legal services.
 
The enhanced CLAS will be launched in two weeks. It has already received strong support from volunteer lawyers and law firms. More details of the enhanced CLAS will be announced at its launch.
 
Family Justice
 
Reforms were made to the Family Justice system last year.
 
We have to minimise the anguish of families going through divorce, and to protect the children involved. Family lawyers have told us that they are supportive of these changes.
 
Building on this, the Ministry of Law will be reviewing other family-related legislation and looking into strengthening the enforcement of maintenance orders to help those in need.
 
Regionalisation of Singapore law practices
 
With dedicated world-class facilities for international commercial arbitration, litigation and mediation collectively in place, Singapore is now able to offer the full suite of dispute resolution services to commercial users.
 
Local lawyers and law firms will benefit as their caseloads increase with the entry of work which would otherwise not have come to our shores. This will also help local law practices expand and tap into the many opportunities in the region.

203314719715066_832332550146610,"On Loss of Monies from AHPETC Funds

WP say they represent the poor man on the street.  Instead, they have taken money from the man on the street to pay their friends.

In this video, we know they over-charged Aljunied residents $6.4 million. The money went to FMSS.

Maybe there was no one taking money through the back door in the dark of the night. There was no need to. 

The money was taken from the front door. In broad daylight.

In layman’s terms: 

They have a business with cash, valuables belonging to the people.

They don’t know what is there

They put friends in charge.

The friends then overpay themselves several million dollars and they are not checked.

Even their own auditors say the accounts are unreliable.

They have no clear idea of what has happened to the cash 

And they say no money is lost."
203314719715066_832261250153740,"I made a speech in Parliament yesterday on the unlawful way in which money was paid out of Aljunied Town Council. There are many serious questions need to be addressed. The Town Council has lost money while FMSS, its management agent, owned by the GM and Secretary of the Town Council,  has made significant profits. For example, the TC overpaid FMSS – by paying much higher fees. Probably in excess of $6 million. And they probably paid nearly $20 million in very questionable ways to FMSS over 4 years. This is the people’s money which has been taken out and given to party supporters .


Here are the key points of my speech:


1. Unlawful actions, breach of fiduciary duties
_______________________________________________

FMSS is owned by Mr Loh, Ms How and Mr Yeo, who had close links to WP and were party supporters. The payments they were verifying and/or approving on behalf of the Town Council, were going into their own companies 

Mr Loh and Ms How were issuing invoices on behalf of FMSS 

Mr Loh and Ms How were then verifying on behalf of the Town Council the work done by FMSS. 

They were certifying on behalf of the Town Council the payment by the Town Council to their own company 

Ms How was then approving on behalf of the Town Council the cheques for payment to FMSS 

Mr Loh was signing the Town Council cheques, for payment to FMSS. 

Allowing this structure is unlawful. This structure cannot be approved by law. 

Town Councillors who approved such a process would be in serious breach of fiduciary duties 

Money paid out in this way, just in one year - $6.6 million. Over 4 years the amount will not be much less than $20 million.

	
2. Aljunied Town Council suffered a loss as a result of the transfers
_______________________________________________


Overcharging for all contracts related to management agents:  Probably around $6.4 million. 

And consider the $20 million or so that must have been paid out under item 1 – there will be some double counting, but nevertheless we are talking very big amounts paid to FMSS.


3. No transparency and accountability
______________________________________________

Refer to Annex 1

FMSS allowed to pay themselves without proper disclosure of ownership 

No discussion on how to mitigate risks from conflict of interest 

Again, a breach of fiduciary duties

Refused to give information to their own auditors Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton LLP 

Refused to give information to PriceWaterHouseCoopers – who were appointed as part of the AGO audit 

Refused to disclose information on related parties as required by FRS – this is in breach of the law

Consistent pattern of concealment 


4. Individual responsibility of each elected Councillor
___________________________________________


Any honest Town Councillor will admit that all this is unacceptable and will want to set right what has gone wrong.

This includes:

Come clean on the facts
Relook the contracts and payments
Recover the overpayments and payments made in breach of fiduciary duties
Take legal action where necessary

Aljunied residents deserve real, honest answers. The WP has to come clean and explain themselves to the public.

Read a funny article in Tamil Murasu on Saturday. It was about a temple elephant named Ruku, in Tamil Nadu.

Ruku went on a retreat to be with other elephants and relax. 

Ruku weighed 4.9 tonnes before it went on the retreat. It weighed 5.4 tonnes after the retreat! Talk about weight gain!

So doctors have now put Ruku on an exercise and diet regimen. Ruku has to walk 2km every day. And no rice for Ruku! (the article states no rice, but is not clear because it also states that Ruku gets a type of rice).

I had spoken to business owners in Little India about why we need to introduce the Public Order (Additional Temporary Measures) Act. 

A riot had occurred on 8 Dec 2013. The immediate task was to put in measures to ensure the safety and security of residents, visitors and other stakeholders in Little India. The residents wanted the government to take action.
 
The residents tell us that Little India feels safer now, after the measure were put in place. Residents no longer face disamenities that arise from excessive drinking, e.g. rowdy behaviour, public urination and vomiting, fights. In the meantime, people have returned to Little India, back to the pre-riot levels.
 
However, some shops that have relied heavily on liquor sales to foreign workers on weekends have been affected by the new measures. The government will work with LISHA to see how we can help these affected business owners, including you. For instance, we have arranged for many of the LISHA members to open shops in recreation centres, patronised by many foreign workers. Some of these owners have adjusted their business models and are doing well.
 
The government is now looking at introducing a new law to better control the supply and excessive consumption of alcohol island wide. Extensive public consultations were conducted and there is strong support from the public, for the introduction of measures, to control the supply and consumption of liquor.
 
We will work collectively to develop a responsible drinking culture in a safe and secure environment."

________________________________________

The Protection from Harassment Act is now in force.
 
Avenues for self-help and civil remedies for victims of harassment are available under the Act.
 
Victims can also claim for damages separately.  In very egregious cases, harassers may also face criminal prosecution.  These two measures will complement the Protection Order, creating a ladder of remedies for victims.
 
However, harassment cannot be dealt with by laws alone. Each of us has a part to play in cultivating community norms, and educating each other on what constitutes socially acceptable behaviour.
 
Our children have a right to grow up in a safe environment, free from discrimination and bullying by peers. We should be free from intimidating, hostile and abusive environment, be it at home or at the workplace, online or offline.
 
The Act puts in place a framework for stopping behaviour which is socially unacceptable, and which better protects the vulnerable."

More education is needed for cat lovers and feeders, as well as residents, so that people understand animals, love them, and not immediately see them as nuisances.

________________________________________________________

This evening I delivered the eulogy for my dear friend Subhas at Mandai Crematorium. Here is the full text:

“Vimala, Sujesh, Friends,
 
All of us offer our deepest condolences to Vimala and Sujesh.
 
Many have said much about Subhas. The outpouring of grief is testimony to the lives Subhas has touched.
 
Why, you can ask?
 
And it's not just the usual explanations,
not just his intellect,
not just his abilities in court,
not just that he had a very big heart,
not just that he had a very big personality.
 
There is something quintessentially Subhas which is all of this and much more. A good person, a noble character and who cared deeply for others and society. When you met him, you felt that about him, that he is a rare person, and you get drawn to him. From the goodness of his heart, a good man who was no one's fool, but always acting in the best interests of his clients and society.
 
We have lost a great man.
It is our loss,
it is our country's loss,
and the country mourns his departure.
 
The media, print, radio, TV, is awash with stories, a testimony to the standing Subhas had.
 
Social media is inundated with condolence messages from all sections of society.
 
Three months ago, we had a tribute event organized by the Association of Muslim lawyers. I was the Guest of Honour.  It was for a fund . Aim was to give ex-prison inmates a second chance in life, named after Subhas. At that event, he spoke movingly of his love for his family and friends in the legal fraternity, and his desire to advance the cause of justice and fair representation. In a way, it has turned out to be a fitting finale for a great lawyer.
 
I met him earlier last year, he was not feeling so good, and he was talking to me about why he is still here. 

By the time September, October came, he was looking much better and we were all hopeful. 

So it was a great shock to hear the news. He has left an indelible mark on the lives of family, friends, and the lawyers of the court. Many people spoke at the AML event and they spoke from their hearts.
 
 To his family, Vimala and Sujesh, Subhas was a loving husband and a loving father who often lamented that he should have spent more time with you. His love for you, Vimala, is expressed from these words he said to you just before he was wheeled into the operating theatre in 2008: ""I see your face in every rose, I see your smile in every cloud.""

Sujesh, your dad is immensely proud of your achievements, and it was one of the proudest moments of his life when you told him of your decision to take up law.

To the legal fraternity, Subhas was like an elder brother. His 40 years of experience in overcoming the odds in court, in cases that had originally seemed to be lost, made him a legend in the criminal bar, his incisive intellect and dogged perseverance were tempered by a sharp wit and infectious sense of humor.

To the people he defended, and the general public, he was a hero.

His reputation for taking up the toughest cases, often pro bono, and then succeeding against odds, made him a mainstay in the news, and a beacon of hope to the accused that he defended.

All this came from his steadfast belief in fair representation and in second chances. He was a fierce and combative champion of these principles and he was never shy in letting me know his views.

I consider Subhas a dear friend and have always found him to be upright, honest, full of integrity and wit. After the October event, he suggested that we have lunch. I agreed, he gave me a date. My diary is run by my PA, I forgot to tell her. At about 12.45pm on a Sunday afternoon, perhaps 1pm, he called me and said, ""Where are you?"" Thankfully I happened to be free and rushed down, and I'm glad I did.
 
I am, together with each one of you, saddened by his passing,
but his legacy will live on, in his writings, in the legal textbooks containing accounts of his cases, newspapers, websites,
and most importantly, in our hearts.

Even though he has passed on, he will live forever as a loving father, loving husband, a gentleman at the Bar and a dear friend to all of us.
 
We mourn together."
203314719715066_815514158495116,"Heard the sad news of the passing of the much admired, loved and respected  Subhas Anandan, - my dear friend and fellow lawyer.
 
Described by many as a titan in criminal law, Subhas’ name is synonymous with tenaciousness in court, a sharp intellect and above all, a generous heart. Subhas’ strong sense of justice, has made him a legal legend to the Bar as well as general public. His unswerving belief in fair representation for the accused, and granting them a second chance in life, makes him an inspiring role model for the rest of the Criminal Bar.
 
My heart is filled with sadness with Subhas’ passing.
 
Many will join me in extending our deepest condolences to his family during this difficult time, and would like them to know that the legal fraternity grieves with them.

203314719715066_815345571845308,Was happy to attend the wedding dinner of my Constituency Director Peiling and hubby Jackson. Lovely and memorable evening.
203314719715066_814641751915690,"Participated in several constituency events last Saturday.  I first surprised the students at the Nee Soon Football and Study Programme at the Chong Pang Community Club where they were having their first mentoring session. The students were full of enthusiasm. The innovative scheme taps on the students’ passion for football and leveraging the programme to help them do well in school.  I dropped by several CC rooms to mingle with the kids.

Visited Sembawang Garden later where I presented Edusave Merit Bursary  awards and certificates to students.  Good to see the students thanking their parents with their hand-made balloons. We also marked the opening of Legundi Park where  I unveiled a plaque. Moving on to Chong Pang Zone 2, I presented another 118 students with their EMB awards and certificates on stage. The parents were invited on stage to receive the award with their children."
203314719715066_813038035409395,"I have been following the issue of stray cats in Nee Soon South. Some of the residents have been irresponsible in feeding stray cats without observing the proper hygiene procedures and follow-ups. This has led to unhappiness amongst residents over hygiene and inconvenience.
 
The MP in the constituency, Dr Lee Bee Wah, has the responsibility to deal with the issue – because her residents are complaining to her.
  
There has been a lot of false statements about what she has done/intends to do. Dr Lee, when she received the complaints, first approached the cat welfare activists on how to deal with the problem. She also polled residents on how they would like to deal with the stray cats. And she engaged cat lovers and tried to explain the situation and listen to their feedback.

No decision has been made on what to do with the cats, as yet. Dr Lee intends to work with the Cat Welfare Society, cat lovers and the relevant agencies to come up with solutions that would make sense for all.

One person who attended one of the engagement meetings went online to make untrue allegations, misrepresenting the discussions, and claiming that a decision has been made to cull the cats when that was simply untrue.

If we want to be a civil society solving problems together, we need to remain truthful, responsible and stick to the facts. It is unproductive to attack those who genuinely try to help and look after the interest of the greater community. Making false allegations sensationalises the situation, but is not a responsible thing to do; and will ultimately impact on how we can operate properly to deal with a community problem.

Just as important, activists have to be mindful there are many people who don’t like the disamenities that are caused by the actions of irresponsible cat feeders. These residents  have rights too. And if they complain to the MP, then the MP has to take action. If they are in the majority, then their wishes cannot be disregarded, simply because a (smaller) group is more vocal. Those who don’t want the cats to be culled should come forward to suggest solutions, to help the residents. Dr Lee Bee Wah has tried to do that – by forming a group, comprising animal lovers, to see what can be done."

Her other brother, Zakir, was the first Malay RSAF pilot in 1992, and previously served as Commanding Officer of 112 Squadron. Zakir is currently the RSAF liaison to the Pacific Air Forces at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii.

Shirin’s elder sister, Zabrina, is a partner in a Singapore-based law firm, heading its Property Law department. Zabrina has worked on a number of legal publications, having held various editorial positions including editor and specialist editor with global legal publisher LexisNexis.

Shirin and her siblings have done very well in their respective careers. Shirin tells me that her parents were very focused on investing in their children’s education. Ultimately, this is what makes the most difference: the attention parents pay to their children, the values of the parents, and the parents’ emphasis on education."

At Nee Soon GRC, we launched a new partnership to offer residents eye-screening at a highly subsidised rate of 50%. The partnership between Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) and us will be open to residents who are 50 years old and above, and are not seeing a doctor for a pre-existing eye condition. Over the next five years, we will work with KTPH to arrange eye-screening at various events or venues.
 
I also hope that everyone would consider doing a regular eye-screening and take good care of their eyes. Prevention, after all, is always better than cure.

The dinner was to celebrate the contributions of Tamil teachers in Singapore who have served as role models for our new generation of Tamil teachers to come. 
 
Amongst them was 84 year old, Chong Pang resident, Mr S Jesudasan, who taught for over 45 years. The former Raffles Institution teacher has mentored many, and the senior members within the STTU like Mr R Kalamohan and Mr Simon Raj. He is perhaps most well-known for penning the lyrics to “Munneru Valibha”, a Tamil song familiar to all Singaporeans.
 
I also met Mr G Perumal, founding member of STTU and Mrs Krishnaveni, who has taught for over five decades and served as Principal of Saradha Devi Tamil School, together with 61 other Pioneer Generation Tamil teachers who have dedicated themselves to grooming generations of Tamil teachers and preserving one of oldest classical languages in the world.
 
The Tamil language is poetic, expressive and steeped in history. It is not the easiest to learn, nor teach. The wonderful teachers we had  have nurtured a love for the language and the appreciation of its beauty.

We owe a huge debt to these teachers. I hope that the next generation of Tamil teachers will follow in their footsteps and continue the good work."

I explained Singapore’s position and experience on the death penalty and how we have been successful in tackling the serious problems of drug abuse, trafficking and related serious crimes.  One of the main reasons that our society is one of the safest in the world is that we take a very tough approach on drugs and related crimes.  If a drug trafficker trafficks in a quantity which can supply 300 drug abusers for a week, he could face the death penalty. This is not revenge; this is not vengeance.  This is based on the principle of deterrence and clear rule of law.

As a result, we have been able to keep our country, our people, our children safe. Many who argued against death penalty put a lot of their focus on people who face the death penalty. Not enough attention is put on their victims. Drug traffickers impose immense penalties, including the death penalty, on their victims. Thousands of people die from drugs and related crimes. We have stopped that in Singapore while countries around the world are losing the war on drugs. We want to protect our people from becoming victims, and to protect our society. Here are the news reports of my remarks at the UN.

I have taken part in the Festival for many years, including participating in the senior citizen dinners, getais, operas, charity and food distributions organised during this period.

And with modern facilities, it is extremely user friendly – though it took some getting used to see all the Sisters carrying electronic entry passes, which is needed for them to get around the premises!

They have made it homely and welcoming, and have planted various fruit trees on the premises.

The Mission looks after some children – they were lovely, charming and friendly. The Mission also runs kindergartens, as it did in the previous premises.

Looking ahead, I am optimistic that Singapore and Africa can do more together in a partnership for growth."

203314719715066_750329711680228,"The Economist recently noted that Singapore is the safest country in the world (for those with population more than a million.) Singapore registered 11 murders in the year 2012. That’s one murder in every 480,000 persons. On the other hand, in Honduras, the world’s most violent country, one in every 1,100 residents was killed.  
 
It is worth noting that we also have a very high solutions rate for murder - which is somewhere in the region of 90 per cent, against the global solutions rate of about 43 per cent..
 
But we have to be vigilant. A recent research study of Singapore’s homicide trends from 1955 to 2011 by two MHA senior officers Tai Wei Shyong (now Chief Prosecutor in AGC) and Tang Gek Hsien is interesting.
 
The authors noted that in recent years, there have been instances of group violence in Singapore between male gangs which have led to deaths. While our homicide rates remain low, it is not possible to eradicate violence altogether.
 
They wisely warned that it was important for us, from a policy perspective, not to assume that historical murder rates will not rise again, if there are changes in our social structures and norms.  Instances of violence should be reviewed regularly to see if the current legal and enforcement frameworks can be more targeted and, hence, more effective. We need to watch out for emerging sub-cultures of violence among socially disenfranchised groups.

This request set me thinking. I felt bad for her- as a result of pressure from family, peers, she is going to get into debt over her wedding. And she had got to a stage where she was prepared to ask someone whom she did not know at all. Pressure to conform to expectations can be tough."

More than 40 recipients turned up to receive their packages from me. I also explained the benefits of the package to them.
203314719715066_740727309307135,"Yesterday, I made a statement on Singapore’s position on what is happening in Gaza.

 I made the following points: 

 1. Both Israel and Hamas are in the wrong. Both bear responsibility for what is happening.
 i. Hamas had launched over 2,000 rockets at Israel, many of them before Israel responded.
 ii. Israel’s response has been disproportionate. Israel can and should do more to ensure that civilian casualties are minimised.

 2. Hamas is deliberately using civilians as shields. The Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri had gone on Gaza national television and said that the human-shield strategy has proven “very effective”. This is a deliberate strategy. President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Mahmoud Abbas has accused Hamas of using civilians and has said, “What are you trying to achieve by sending rockets?... I do not like trading in Palestinian blood.” There has not been one rocket from the West Bank, controlled by PNA.

 3. Israel needs to show greater commitment to the two-state solution, and should comply with its international law obligations. And Hamas should stop its attacks on Israel, and change its intention to destroy Israel. 

 If indeed it is a pure targeting of innocent civilians, that is completely unacceptable. It is an international crime and we would support prosecution under international criminal laws.

 4. We have supported the Palestinians in their legitimate aspirations.
 i. Last year, at the United Nations General Assembly, Singapore voted for all 17 Palestinian-related resolutions.
 ii. We have consistently supported the right of Palestinians to have their own state.
 iii. I met the PNA FM last year.
 iv. We also supported visits from Ministers from PNA to Singapore. 
 v. Indeed, we financially support that: since 2013, we have been participating in the Conference on Cooperation among East Asian Countries for Palestinian Development, or CEAPAD. 

 During CEAPAD I in Tokyo last year, we announced Singapore’s enhanced technical assistance package for the PNA, worth at five million Singapore dollars for five years, which is more than what several of our regional countries have pledged. Under this package, we have received several delegations and study visits.

 vi. Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Masagos Zulkifli met with the PNA Prime Minister during CEAPAD II in Jakarta, early this year. And SMS Masagos encouraged the Prime Minister to send more Palestinians to Singapore under this package.

 5. There is a limit to what Singapore can do to solve the crisis. We do not have much leverage on either side even though we have relationships with Israel, the PNA and several Arab countries. 

 6. We will support the UN in the role that it has taken. We support the decision of the Human Rights Council in Geneva to establish an independent Commission of Inquiry to investigate all violations of international law, including violations of humanitarian law. 

 7. We say that all parties involved should cooperate in that inquiry. There is also a limit to what the international community can do. The number killed in Syria over the past two years is 180,000. Thousands of innocent children and women have been killed. This is more than the number killed in Palestine in 20 years – yet, there was not much that the international community could do in the Syrian case. And thousands have been killed in Sunni-Shia conflict in Iraq in the last 12 months. Again, there is not much that the international community can do. 

 Political will is needed to overcome the problems and bring an end to the conflict.

203314719715066_740583559321510,"I launched an exhibition of the proposed Northpoint City complex at Northpoint Shopping Mall last week. Northpoint City will be an exciting new icon for #NeeSoon. It will be the largest mall in northern Singapore connected to an integrated, air-con bus interchange and the #Yishun MRT station. It will also house the first Community Club in a mall.
 
My fellow MPs and I promised our residents a rejuvenation of Nee Soon, the creation of a vibrant heartbeat for the North. We have seen good results  - to name a few, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Yishun Pond, upgraded public spaces, Home Improvement Programme, Neighbourhood Renewal Programme, more buses, more elderly wellness centres and now, Northpoint City. 
 
Our efforts to energise Nee Soon will not stop here. At Northpoint exhibition launch, I shared that the heart-ware is equally important as the hardware. I am glad that the Frasers Centrepoint team handling the project were sensitive to that and thoughtfully integrated communal spaces within the development. When completed, Nee Soon will be buzzing with activities as residents, families and friends congregate and build lasting relationships and memories. What I would really like to see is not just a vibrant commercial town but also a Nee Soon community where people care for each other.

203314719715066_740152572697942,"Took the Family Justice Bill through Parliament yesterday. 

The Bill seeks to minimise as far as possible the anguish felt by the divorcing parties by strengthening court management processes and providing better protection and support to everyone involved, in particular the children. 

More details about the Bill can be found here: https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/minlaw/en/news/parliamentary-speeches-and-responses/speech-by-Minister-on-Family-Justice-Bill.html.
 
Statistics released recently show that divorce rates last year reached the second-highest level in history, while marriage numbers fell. In this climate, the Bill hopes to help couples and families in distress.
 
The approach is to simplify the court process, reduce costs, and reduce the acrimony, stress, and focus on the welfare of the children."

203314719715066_739384482774751,"I was recently invited to be the Patron to the Bone Marrow Donor Programme  (BMDP). I was most happy to accept the role as BMDP, a non profit organisation,  does an amazing job of  saving lives through its tireless, selfless work with different stakeholders and patients in Singapore and around the world with blood related diseases such as leukaemia and lymphoma.

Last Thursday at BMDP, I  gave a symbolic award to the 100th Singaporean bone marrow donor, Lim Yun Song a 27 year-old engineer and NTU graduate. This was in recognition of the commitment he and all the other bone marrow donors have made in a purely voluntary capacity - a priceless gift of bone marrow (blood stem cells) to save the life of someone. Some people may ask why only 100? The BMDP has done amazing work and has registered 44,000 donor volunteers. But it is very difficult to find the right match for a person who needs bone marrow transplant. The chance of finding a matching donor is only 1 in 20,000. Thus we need to get a lot more volunteers to register.
 
The BMDP manages Singapore’s only registry of bone marrow donors and can literally be the last chance of survival for patients with terminal blood-related illnesses. With Singapore’s unique and rapidly changing demographic, it is more important than ever to recruit more volunteers to join the registry and make sure that each patient is given this last chance of survival.

We need  to raise awareness that bone marrow donation is a safe and simple procedure. There are many misconceptions about bone marrow donation. We need people to understand it imposes just a little discomfort and inconvenience on our donors but they are back to normal in just a few days.

The BMDP is an impressive outfit,  under its passionate CEO, Jane Prior and many many passionate volunteers. The BMDP also provides a 365-day service to the hospitals to search the local register and, if necessary, extend this around the world in order to find a matching donor for their patients. So far almost 500 patients have been given a chance of survival through the work of the BMDP and the need grows every year as transplants become a routine treatment for these most common forms of cancer.

And it is important that the public is treated with courtesy. Civil servants must treat the public properly.
 
Sometimes it happens the other way as well - with frontline officers getting rudely treated by some members of the public. Thankfully these are a small minority.
 
Recently I was briefed about an unfortunate incident that occurred at the Legal Aid Bureau. A man had sought the bureau’s help in commencing divorce proceedings against his wife. The bureau was unable to help him as he had been married for less than three years, the minimum legal requirement (barring exceptional circumstances). The man became agitated and started smoking and burning forms in the bureau. He also threatened to smash the office with a hammer and burn it down.The man was arrested before he could carry out his threats.
 
What this man did was unacceptable. His verbal abuse and threats toward LAB staff were uncalled for, especially since the staff had tried their best to help him. But this is not a standalone incident.  In the past few months, I have heard of other instances of civil servants being verbally abused. This is not right. 

Civil servants perform their duties to the best of their abilities, just like everyone else. They play vital but oft-unseen roles  in the running of our country."

Mr Nathan’s story is an inspiring one for all of us – his strong sense of duty took him from very humble beginnings to the highest office in the land. It is also an example of what is possible in Singapore - in few countries can a person of his background achieve what he achieved.

It is due to the hard work, resilience, and sacrifices of Mr Nathan and others in his generation that Singapore enjoys the success that it has today. We have much to thank these pioneers for.

###  
REMARKS AT THE BOOK LAUNCH
 
It is an honour and pleasure to launch the Tamil-language version of Mr S.R. Nathan’s memoirs, “An Unexpected Journey: Path to the Presidency”.
 
Mr Nathan led a varied and successful life, packed with enough incident for several lifetimes and several careers.
 
As his wife, Umi, wrote in an afterword to the English-language version: “On more than one occasion I thought he had reached the end of a successful career and could look forward to retirement. Each time a new call has come and he has responded. We both feel that in answering the summons we are repaying a debt to Singapore…”
 
Mr Nathan’s strong sense of duty took him from very humble beginnings to the highest office in the land.
 
His is an inspiring story of what an individual, starting from almost literally nothing in the most unpropitious of circumstances, can through native intelligence, resolution, and application achieve.
 
His is also a uniquely Singapore story. His life is an example and a vindication of the Singapore system.  In few countries can a man of his provenance achieve what he did.

We have become a very different and successful society today.  The differences are due to the hard work and sacrifices of Mr Nathan and his generation.  The opportunities for advancement are there, and have multiplied, thanks to the achievements of Mr Nathan’s generation.
 
Naturally, today there are new challenges – some of them very serious ones.
 
But life is a constant challenge.  I do not think anybody wants to return to the old poverty-stricken, unstable, indeed dangerous Singapore that Mr Nathan and his generation faced.
 
His life shows how with determination, even the most serious of challenges can be overcome. He never just grumbled, but rolled up his sleeves and set to work.
 
Let me again quote Mr Nathan’s wife: “There is a lesson in his story for all young people, however competitive the world may seem.”
 
As Singapore’s 6th Foreign Minister, I was fortunate to inherit an institution that Mr Nathan, more than any other single individual officer, did most to shape, when he was Permanent Secretary in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
 
It was not always so.
 
Singapore did not expect to become an independent country. Since 1959, we had some experience of internal self-government, but foreign affairs, like defence, was the responsibility of first, the British, and after 1963, the federal Malaysian authorities in Kuala Lumpur.
 
So when we became unexpectedly independent in 1965, we were almost totally unprepared. We had to create a foreign ministry on the fly in the midst of many more urgent and immediate priorities.
 
Older officers tell me that I cannot imagine how it was in the early days: people without training, a young country without any established foreign policy structure.
 
In the early days, Mr Lee Kuan Yew and first generation leaders like Mr S. Rajaratnam, and Dr Goh Keng Swee, took direct charge of foreign affairs.
 
But we obviously could not continue that way. And so, as it had many times in many different fields, the government turned to Mr Nathan to set things in order.
 
I never worked with Mr Nathan in the Foreign Ministry. So I asked one of the older officers who was a junior officer when Mr Nathan was Permanent Secretary to tell me what Mr Nathan did to transform the Ministry into the highly professional organisation it has become.
 
Let me share with you the three lessons that he told me Mr Nathan imparted to young officers. The three lessons made a deep imprint on the then young officers – he in turn tried to impart them to a new generation of Foreign Service Officers. I think they have a wider application than just to the Foreign Ministry.
 
First, do not be distracted by peripherals, and get to the core of any situation or problem. And having identified and analysed the core issue, express yourself succinctly, clearly and directly. Or as he recalled Mr Nathan was wont to say ""cut out the long palaver and get to the point"".  This may seem obvious, even trite.  But I can assure you that this is rarer than you may think.
 
Second, your duty is to serve the national interest of Singapore. Do your duty without fear. Do not be deterred by either any external opposition or, which is perhaps sometimes more difficult, by the necessity of telling your own superiors unpleasant realities. He told me that once, having confessed to something which did not turn out very well, Mr Nathan asked him rhetorically: “What’s the worst that can happen to you? Will you be hanged? Get on with your work.”  This, he said, gave him an entirely new perspective on life.
 
And third, Mr Nathan valued steadfastness and loyalty in his staff, and in turn gave them his loyalty, however junior they may have been.  Or as he puts it, “if our rears deserved to be kicked, and they often did, he kicked our rears himself and defended us to others. He took responsibility for our actions and never hung us out to dry.”
 
Henry Kissinger is said to have once described Singapore’s foreign policy as “cold blooded”. Perhaps. But that attitude has enabled us to survive and prosper in a dangerous and uncertain world. And we lose it only to our detriment.
 
I do not mean to suggest that Mr Nathan is cold blooded. On the contrary, all who know him, know him as a very humble and compassionate person whose sympathies were instinctively with the less fortunate, and those qualities infuse his memoirs.
 
But there is a time and place for everything; a time for compassion and a time to do one’s duty regardless and be kind afterwards. Mr Nathan knew that.
 
Mr Nathan was not only a committed public servant. His memoirs reveal his deep attachment to his family, his friends, and to all Singaporeans. And of course, his services to the Indian and Hindu community: He played the key role in transforming the Hindu Endowments Board (HEB) into a professional organisation. He played the key role in ensuring that the HEB temples are well-managed, and provide good service to devotees.
 
Just over a week ago, Mr Nathan celebrated his 90th birthday. A celebration was held in his honour. I was in India on my first official visit to the new Indian government and could not attend. So allow me to conclude by taking this opportunity to wish him many more productive, successful, and healthy years.
 
Again his wife puts it best, and it is fitting that I give her the last word: “Even today he hates holidays and always needs a task. His mind has to be active”.  So expect Mr Nathan to be actively thinking of something.  In fact I know he is thinking of a couple of things – he has told me."
203314719715066_727858453927354,"We had put up an Expression Wall early this year, at the Amphitheatre in Chong Pang City. It was hugely successful, with many people expressing their views. We put up another wall last week. This time we were hoping to hear ideas, views, thoughts on how we can develop quality wellness and care centres for our elderly.
 
The response from the residents has been overwhelming. We kept the wall for extra days, and had to add more writing space, using sheets – just like the last time. It has also been fun for residents to express themselves creatively as well as reading the views and drawings of others.
 
We have captured every comment on the wall, including taking pictures and videos of them. This is important because some of the residents have written over the comments of others. There were some rude comments and  graffiti as well. Some were drawn by little kids. This is to be expected. There were also negative comments and complaints by residents on policies which they want changed – these were genuine expression of views. People are entitled to disagree with government policies and give their views. This is what this expression wall is all about.
 
Unfortunately, there was also some unconstructive element to it. Some Opposition supporters (clearly identifiable because of what they did) decided to co-ordinate and hijack the Wall – defacing the Wall, writing over other comments, scratching out existing comments, and standing by the Wall and asking people to write down negative comments, calling for the death of one of our founding fathers. They also took screen shots of the negative comments which they themselves wrote, presumably so that they can post them on line and pretend that that these were comments by residents. (We noted they quickly took pictures of such negative comments and posted them on some websites). One such  writer scribbled across a section of the wall to cancel out dozens of good suggestions, and wrote very prominently the name of the political party he supported. We did not stop them. People can judge for themselves what such a behaviour means. He and some others believe that freedom of expression means that only their views should be seen, and so he needed to scratch out the positive comments.( As I have said earlier some of the comments which were critical of policies were honest expression of views by residents. The unconstructive behaviour was exhibited by only a few, though they attempted to scratch out large parts).

Despite all this co-ordinated effort, it is heartening that that the majority – about 90 per cent of the comments – were positive or constructive. We will review the comments in greater detail and do an update later. We were able to tabulate because we kept track of all the comments, including those which were scratched out, written over, so we know what all the comments were. We will send all the feedback to the relevant agencies.

The SIP is a great success, achieved through the close cooperation of both countries.  Over the past two decades, it has evolved beyond industrial park and township development into new areas, such as social governance and modern services.

One of my stops at the SIP was the Fangzhou Community Club, one of several such clubs in the SIP.  There, the local authorities had taken a leaf from Singapore's experience to provide under one roof a wide range of community and social services, such as a health service station, a library, and other facilities catering to different segments of the population, including the young and the elderly.  In my interactions with the residents at the club, it was clear that they held a warm and special regard for Singapore.

The SIP is indeed a testimony to the mutual commitment between our two countries to build a lasting friendship and deliver tangible benefits to our peoples.

203314719715066_718300804883119,"In the past a student excelling at sports will have to make a hard choice: Sports or Studies?
 
Now the choice is a bit easier. Take the case of table-tennis. Students who are good can enroll in the Sports School. They get 1 teacher to 5 students & the teacher works around their competition schedules. They go overseas to compete, then come back to their studies with the help of their teachers. 

Er. Dr. Lee Bee Wah, President of the Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) has made a number of moves to help the students.
 
There is a linkup between the Sports School and Republic Polytechnic (RP), and recently, with University of Liverpool and UniSIM. The new partnership means any retired national table-tennis players will be able to obtain their first university degree with their fees entirely waived.
 
One outstanding young lady - the heroine of this post, who has benefitted from these arrangements is Isabelle Li. She is one of our best players with a very bright future. She had gone from the Sports School to RP. A few weeks ago, she topped RP in her studies. Now, she is going to go to Yale-NUS. Her achievements in both areas are outstanding.
 
Isabelle's entry into Yale-NUS has gotten Dr Lee to do one more thing - to create a fund to help such students with their university fees. She approached Dr Tahir and within a matter of days, Dr Tahir and his friends raised $1 million for the fund. 

This fund means that our local-born, retired Singaporean table-tennis Olympians can choose to obtain their first university degree anywhere in the world. Their tuition fee and living expenses will be paid for. STTA wants to encourage and support our local-born players to pursue their Olympic dreams.
 
Have to thank Dr Lee for her tireless efforts to ensure a bright future for table-tennis in Singapore, and Dr Tahir and his friends for their generosity.

There were many queries on the prospects of the dispute resolution sector and the broader legal industry in Singapore.
 
Singapore is well-placed to benefit from Asia’s rise in the world economy. Our position in ASEAN – which is the world’s eighth-largest economy if taken as a single entity – is also a plus for us. Given that law follows business, an increase in commercial activity and investment into Asia and ASEAN will naturally lead to a corresponding rise in the demand for high quality legal work, and good lawyers.
 
Our plans to establish the Singapore International Commercial Court, and the Singapore International Mediation Centre, together with the fact that Spore is already one of the world's leading arbitration centres, will help in making Singapore the premier dispute resolution centre in Singapore.

Mr Yang Tiong Hock has suggested that we empower our consular officers, more, to make decisions with regard to the issuance of Document of Identity (DOI).  
 
The DOI is an emergency travel document that facilitates a Singaporean’s return home when his/her passport has been lost while abroad. We are quite strict about the issuing of DOIs. 

Security is our main concerns as those who wish to do Singapore harm, could exploit DOIs to come to Spore, if we did not have strict protocols. We therefore require Singaporeans to appear in person at our Missions for the issuance of the DOI to ensure proper verification of identity. Understandably this will be difficult in locations where a Singapore diplomatic mission is not present. 
 
Our officers can and do exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis, so long as Singapore’s security is not compromised. 

The case of Mr Yang’s brother was one such example. Mr Yang was in Istanbul, and did not wish to go to Ankara where our Embassy was, to obtain the DOI. Our Consul General in Istanbul was travelling. The usual rule will be for a consular officer to meet with Mr Yang, verify his identity, before the DOI is issued. In this case, given the facts, our Embassy in Ankara waived the usual protocol, issued the DOI and couriered it to Mr Yang in Istanbul a day after his brother was found. Both brothers departed Istanbul for Singapore the following day."

Representatives of the major religions and many old friends were at the event, including the President of IRO, Mr Noor Marican. 
 
Former President SR Nathan who is the Patron of IRO joined us at the launch. The IRO represents 10 main religions and comprises 200 religious leaders and followers of various faiths.
 
The disappearance of the historic book,  its subsequent discovery in London, and the publication now again in Singapore is quite a story. First published in 1949, the book highlights the essential inter-faith ideals that have driven the IRO, and has been described as a collection of the noble ideas of the founding fathers of IRO. 65 years later, IRO council member and Imam of Baalwie Mosque Singapore Habib Hassan Attas, by a stroke of luck, managed to get hold of the last available copy of the book in London. Reprinting of the book will make it easily available again.
Even though published 65 years ago, its title and passages remain very relevant today.

This quote  from the one of founding fathers of IRO, His Eminence Maulana Mohamed Abdul Aleem Siddiqui is very resonant:

“It is not religion that causes disunion – it is rather the ignorance of religion that causes disunion. No religion, whether such religion is based upon revelation or upon logical moral precepts, ever taught disunion and moral degradation for mankind. The only thing that we can do is to let followers of each and every religion know the teachings of other religions, so that a spirit of fellowship may be created among them and so that they can all work together to spread the accepted moral principles and to fight common evils."
203314719715066_710479422331924,"Can the government get involved if a Singaporean gets illegal sexual services overseas, but is not satisfied and wants a refund ? The answer seems obvious. But it was not obvious to one person at least.

Some days ago, I wrote on the work done by MFA officers providing consular services. Singaporeans are making more overseas trips, almost 7 million last year compared to 3.6 million a decade ago. From time to time, they run into trouble and seek help from our consular staff. We handled over 3,000 consular cases last year.

Many cases are genuine. But sometimes we do get odd requests. We have to draw the line between what is personal responsibility and what’s not. SPS Sam Tan highlighted some of these cases in Parliament. Here are some of them.
 
1. A Singaporean sought MFA’s assistance for a refund after he had gotten illegal sexual services in a foreign country. He wasn’t satisfied with what he had gotten. We had to tell him that MFA could not help!  
 
 2. We want Singaporeans to marry and have children. But there are limits. A Singaporean had sought MFA's assistance to persuade his foreign girlfriend, to expedite her divorce proceedings with her husband, so that he could marry her. Not something MFA can do.
 
3. Did the chicken come first or egg. Answer? The locals.
MFA received a complaint from a Singaporean, who claimed that he was subjected to racial discrimination overseas, because he received a smaller piece of KFC chicken compared to what the locals had. He wanted MFA to investigate this instance and seek justice in that foreign country for the unfair treatment he claimed to have received. We told him we could not do that.
 
4. Success coach Rob Liana once said everyone has baggage, maybe we should help each other carry it. But sometimes we just have to pay for it. A Singaporean insisted that it was MFA's responsibility to retrieve a kitchen appliance he left behind, in a foreign country, because he had no money to pay for the excess baggage.

The article has useful advice for Singaporeans travelling overseas including e-Registration, as well as looking at MFA’s Consular mobile app and twitter page. There is also an infographic with the five most common requests for consular assistance and a step-by-step guide on what to do in such cases.
 
Singaporeans made 6.9 million overseas trips in 2013, as compared to 3.6 million a decade ago. The workload of our consular officers has correspondingly grown, both in volume and complexity. More than 3,000 consular cases were handled last year.
 
Our consular officers, both in MFA HQ and at our overseas missions, work hard to help Singaporeans in need of assistance. I have often received emails from Singaporeans who have written to thank and highlight the efforts of our officers, not just for helping in moments of distress, but also for ‘simple’ situations like helping with a lost passport.
 
That said, there are limits to what our consular officers can do. Local laws and international rules sometimes constrain the extent to which we can render assistance, despite our best efforts. 

Sometimes we also receive some truly bizarre or unreasonable requests. You can read about some of them in the past COS Speeches (http://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/media_centre/press_room/pr/2013/201303/press_20130308.html ; http://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/media_centre/press_room/pr/2012/201203/press_20120306_02.html).

203314719715066_703965272983339,"I returned on Thursday from a five-day visit to Mexico. This was the first stand-alone visit by a Singapore FM to Mexico. I had a good series of meetings in Mexico City, including the second round of bilateral political consultations which I co-chaired with my Mexican counterpart, Secretary José Antonio Meade Kuribreña. 

We had good and wide-ranging discussion. This was in fact the fourth time that we have met in less than a year. In Mexico City, I also met Mexican Undersecretary of Industry and Commerce Jose Rogelio Garza, and spoke at Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on “Bridging the Pacific: the Singapore-Mexico Partnership"". I also had meetings with several Mexican businessmen. 

Singapore’s links with Mexico go back centuries. Few Singaporeans know that the Mexican Silver Dollar was used as the currency for trade in Southeast Asia between the 16th and 19th Centuries and that the monetary compensation which the British East India Company agreed to pay the Sultan of Johor for rights to utilise Singapore as a trading post was actually made in Mexican Silver Dollars. Many spices, fruits and food in Southeast Asian cuisine (chilli, sweet potato, tomatoes, corn to name a few) have their origins in Mexico, and were introduced into the region by Spanish traders.  

Today, our bilateral relations are growing strongly. There are over 40 Singapore companies present in Mexico today, including Keppel, SembCorp and Banyan Tree, and we are Mexico’s second largest foreign investor from the Asia-Pacific region, behind Japan. Mexico’s footprint in Singapore is also growing, and there are now some 70 Mexican companies based in Singapore including PEMEX and Grupo Modelo which distributes the Corona Beer. 

We mark the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Mexico and Singapore in 2015, and we will commemorate this milestone with a series of events, including the State Visit by President Tony Tan to Mexico. This will be an historic visit – the first by a Singapore President not only to Mexico, but to Latin America.  

Mexico is undertaking a historic restructuring in its energy sector, labour management, telecoms and education sector. The restructuring will help Mexico lift off from where it is today – already a top-20 economy in the world, and a strong, world class manufacturing centre. Mexico offers exciting opportunities for investors.

There are tremendous opportunities to grow the relationship further. Singapore and Mexico are key trading hubs for ASEAN and Latin America respectively, and we can be the key gateway to access our two regions. Singapore and Mexico are also committed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP) which will be a game changer once it is concluded, opening up even more opportunities for companies and people."

I gave another interview to BT recently, which was published last Saturday (May 17). In the latest interview, a lot of ground was covered - on the many changes that have been made to the legal system, and the importance of getting our international relations right.
 
I also discussed further proposed changes to the legal system. I told BT that my Ministry had set up a Committee to consider some aspects of the Penal Code, including the laws relating to homicide.  
 
I also spoke to BT about cases where death results after a rape, or where after a child has been assaulted.  My personal view ( which I shared in the interview) is that in such cases, the accused should  be required prove that he did not intend to cause death of the rape victim or child.  If the accused cannot prove that, then he should face the death penalty.

__________________________________________

Last week, I went to Nay Pi Taw (NPT), Myanmar on Friday for the ASEAN FMs meeting and came back on Saturday. Travelling to Nay Pi Taw was not easy. You could fly to Yangon and then take a four hour car ride. Or you could fly into Bangkok and catch a connecting flight to NPT. But you may have to wait 3-4 hours in Bangkok because of flight connections.

I spent a total of about 20 hours travelling to NPT and back.

During the ASEAN FMs meeting, we discussed a number of important issues. The troubling developments in the South China Sea (SCS) and the recent tensions were discussed.

I also raised the issue of haze. It is likely that the El Nino effect could be quite severe this year. That means that the haze could be worse in the second half of this year – unless preventative measures are taken. We encouraged Indonesia to ratify the ASEAN Transboundary Haze Treaty quickly. We also encouraged Indonesia to consider adopting the Haze Monitoring System (HMS). The HMS will help to pinpoint the culprits who are responsible for starting fires."

_____________________
 
Recently as I was driving along Cavenagh Road, I saw something which made me think a lot. 
A domestic helper was walking with a young girl in school uniform. The girl was probably 14, 15 or so. The domestic helper was carrying a heavy bag of grocery and a backpack which looked like the young girl's school bag. The young girl was carrying an umbrella. It had just stopped raining. As I passed the couple, I saw the young girl handing over the umbrella to the house help, and the house help taking it. The girl was then walking, arms completely free. The helper had her grocery bag in one hand, the umbrella in the other hand and the backpack on her back.

Questions went through my mind : to what extent do we as parents teach our children to treat others with compassion and kindness? In Singapore we are lucky that so many of our households have been able to employ domestic help. But do we teach our children to treat our helpers, with respect, compassion? The young girl made the house help carry everything, including the umbrella ( once it was no longer raining), while she had her hands completely free. Will she grow up, learning to treat others with respect, and be considerate ?

This education has to start with parents. We have to treat everyone with a spirit of compassion, kindness, and be considerate."

203314719715066_697123377000862,"Buddha's teachings are as relevant today, in our stressful and complex living environment, as when he first preached. In some countries, the teachings and practices of Buddhism, particularly on one’s attitude towards living a good, peaceful and fulfilling life has met with an increasingly popular following, even by those who are not practising Buddhists.

Buddha says that all wrong doing arises because of the mind. If the mind is transformed, can wrong-doing remain? It refers to the need to train and develop the mind and to free our minds from limits and negativity. I also like the verse “The thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared’’. Buddha showed us great compassion. We can embrace all living beings without discrimination. 

We sometimes lose our focus amidst the rush, at work, at home, dealing with people. Buddha's words help put things in the right perspective. We can become more focused on what’s important in life. The mind is the source of happiness and unhappiness and we should train it to focus on the positive, goodness and truth, and not dragged down by selfishness, ambitions and negative thoughts.

Wishing all Buddhists a Happy Vesak Day.

Desmond Lee (Minister of State at MND), and I have been discussing the issue of improving our stray animal management practices with AVA and the animal welfare groups (AWGs). We met up with several AWGs such as SOSD, SPCA and ACRES to discuss their concerns and possible solutions.

Last month, Desmond led a small group of officials, vets and representatives of AWGs, to Australia to get a better understanding of Australian practices, and visited their animal shelters.

AVA recently engaged international animal control expert, Brian Faulkner,  to help us  on acceptable animal trapping practices. Brian is an animal control consultant from the UK, who has dedicated his life to animal welfare and humane stray control.

Pastor Andrew from NHCS has worked with us in the community for nearly 10 years. New Hope operates shelters, in units offered to them by HDB among other services. Pastor Andrew and his people truly serve all in need, without regard to religion, race or language. He is very inspiring, and I count myself as very fortunate to have met and worked with him. At the opening, 3 other persons whom New Hope helped also shared their stories with us.

RAGENA faced some family setbacks. Her mother passed on and after a split with her husband, their HDB flat had to be sold. She had to live separately from her children. New Hope helped with a shelter, provided by HDB; HDB had allocated a number of units to be managed by New Hope, which can be used for such situations, for needy families. She also attends life-skill training and receives regular counselling from the staff. Ragena has overcome many of her challenges and looks forward to a new beginning, including applying for a new HDB flat.

MR LEE had a flat but sold it to help his brother financially. He then had difficulties finding a place to stay. New Hope helped him with a temporary shelter. With counselling and advice from New Hope, he was inspired and determined to work hard. He now lives in a new space with a friend and has applied for another HDB rental flat. He is working as a football referee, and is determined to make a better life for himself.

SITI SARAH is very talented. She performed an acoustic version of Katy Perry's ""The One That Got Away"" with her guitar on stage. She lived in a shelter provided by New Hope from 2009 to 2011 with her family. The staff worked with her parents to find a job and long-term accommodation.

She was in a hurry, and left the bag behind.  A day later she realised that she didn’t have her bag. She couldn’t remember where she had left it. She went to Challenger and searched. Couldn’t find it, and the staff didn’t know anything about it. She went to the Funan Centre Lost and Found and couldn’t find her bag either. Then she went to TCC – she didn’t think she had left the bag there, but went to look anyway. And there was Nazri, smiling at her – he was the one who had served her earlier. Nazri told her that he had found the bag, kept it safe, and was wondering when she would come back to collect it !

She  was very very relieved. All of us will come across wonderful, honest people like Nazri – he is a great guy.

According to a recent report by OECD,  36 million American adults have low skills. And these are not just older workers. In two of the three categories tested, numeracy and technological proficiency, young Americans who are on the cusp of entering the workforce — ages 16 to 24 —rank last, says Mr  Zakaria.
 
Quoting from French economist Thomas Piketty, Mr Zakaria notes that in the long term,  the main force in favour of resolving inequalities is education - or what he calls ""diffusion of knowledge and skills''.
 
Mr Zakaria also points out how  partisan politicking  has prevented good education policies from being implemented – even if a policy is good, it will be opposed for political reasons.  And this has allowed many other countries to overtake America."

Popular emcees Mr Wang Lei and Ms Lee Pei Fen shared information about the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) in a light-hearted and entertaining manner using Mandarin and dialects. They explained how the senior citizens’ medical needs will be taken care of. Residents were very appreciative of the PGP and the efforts we are making in explaining to them.
 
In the afternoon, we hosted a block party with residents from Blk 148, 149 and 150 organised by Zone 4 RC.

I went to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) for a dialogue with the staff on Friday, 25 April. I visited three wards (geriatrics, dementia and physiotherapy) to chat with the patients and caregivers before the dialogue session. 
 
I was struck by  85 year-old Mr Toh . His wife, Mdm Ng is 82 years old and has been hospitalised. Mr Toh, visits her twice a day, even though he himself is infirm, and has difficulty moving around – he lives in Yishun, and takes a bus to the hospital. His love, affection and care for his wife was quite touching to see. He is a sweet man, spends a lot of time with his wife, before going back home. I asked him permission to write this note, as I thought I should share his story of devotion and care.
 
The geriatric and dementia wards indicate the challenges facing us.
 
Nearly 1 million of our current citizen population will be aged over 65 before 2030. That's 40% of our population. We will have two working adults supporting one elderly person in 2030, down from six adults to one elderly today. This will have a significant social and economic impact on Singapore – on taxes, on our ability to provide for our people.
 
It is an issue that deserves attention and serious thought."

203314719715066_686616568051543,"SMU Law Students have done well again in the Jessups. This Moot competition is held in the US. Heartiest congrats to the team!

I am told that the competition is getting tougher and tougher every year (as is to be expected). Thus the SMU team’s performance is particularly noteworthy.

It is interesting that the young SMU Law School is doing so well – they have been chosen to represent Singapore, in the last two years. And in the competition itself, they have come in  2nd  on both attempts. This, despite the Law School having started only in 2007.

I wonder if this has to do with the fact that SMU students are Juris Doctor or whether SMU has devised innovative ways to prepare its students for what is a very competitive international competition.  Noteworthy that  Prof Chen Si Yuan, who trains the SMU students, was a Jessup Mooter from NUS. Whatever the reason, congrats are due to SMU Law School.

I am sometimes asked by students whether taking part in such Moot competitions helps in subsequent law practice. I share with them my own experience – I was in the 1984 team which went to Washington. I will say that all four of us in the team felt that we had benefitted from the experience – the training in terms of thinking, research, writing memorials, and presenting arguments clearly.

We had a great teacher in Prof Bob Beckman, who has trained generations of Jessup Mooters, including the current Chief Justice, Attorney-General, Judge of Appeal Justice VK Rajah, my Senior Minister of State for Law, Ms Indranee Rajah, as well as several other top SCs . And the experience of taking part in such a competition cannot simply be measured in terms of whether it makes you a better lawyer ( though I think it undoubtedly does).

Before I took public office, I used to go and judge some of the (internal) Singapore rounds of Jessup Moots. The standards by then were much much higher than our standards in the 80s. Now, I suspect, the standards will have qualitatively gone up again, several notches.

Attached is an ST article April14 reporting on SMU students’ performance at this year’s Jessups."

203314719715066_684135838299616,"Very often, the Spore education system gets compared with the Finnish education model. Finland (rightly) get much praise for doing well in educating their kids and topping global rankings for test results. 

A PISA ranking, which was released Dec 9,  provides some interesting perspectives. Singapore’s 15-year-old kids continued to do well in PISA tests, coming in second in the global ranking - after China for maths. Singapore also had the second highest proportion (12.3%) of students who are top performers in maths, science and reading. Finland, which used to rank among the top countries including leading the table for science and reading a decade ago, has fallen 22 points on its 2009 results with smaller declines (12 points and 9 ) in reading and science. Finland's scores are worsening faster than other countries with falling scores such as Canada and Denmark.

This is based on results for the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a worldwide study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  85,000 students worldwide took part in a computer-based problem-solving test. In another Pisa results published two weeks ago, Singapore students topped the global ranking on creative problem solving. Finland was ranked 10th.

Why this relative decline of Finland? According to The Economist (report attached) quoting the Finnbay news website, the golden days for the Finns are over. Leena Krokfors, an academic in Finland, blames declining motivation and a failure of math teachers and the curriculum to inspire enthusiasm.  Economist quotes some who think that aspects of the Finnish education system may be the reason for the weaker performance. The full Economist report is below. 

While I think the gloomy conclusions on the Finnish education system are overdone,  nevertheless the Economist article shows that there are no easy answers or solutions – in every system, in every country, there are issues.  

The lesson for us : our approach has yielded decent results, our children do well. But we have to continue to try and improve, and cater to children of different abilities, make sure they can all be helped to maximise their potential. Everyone can achieve in some way.

Tommy is of course well-known internationally for having guided the historic 3rd UN Conference on the Law of the Sea and the Rio Earth Summit to successful conclusion.  Tommy was also Singapore’s Chief Negotiator for the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, whose 10th anniversary we are celebrating this year.  He also chaired the negotiations that produced the ASEAN Charter.  In all of these occasions, Tommy has displayed the tremendous skills and typical grace of the consummate negotiator.

203314719715066_681399178573282,"As part of my visit last week to Sri Lanka, I made a short trip to Jaffna in the North of the island. It was clear that Jaffna has been making significant and positive progress since I last visited in May 2012. There was construction taking place, new coats of paint on walls, people were more upbeat and dressed better, more businesses have sprung up. There was much more of a buzz about the city and a palpable sense of energy and optimism. 

In Jaffna, I witnessed the inauguration of several projects to help the young people of Jaffna: SIF’s project to enhance English language proficiency and assessment; a youth corner at the Jaffna Library; and a mobile library which will benefit some 38 schools in Jaffna. NLB has also donated more than 10,000 books to the Jaffna library. We estimate that over 3,000 students will benefit from these projects. 

The brightness in the faces of the children, as they were exposed to new ideas, books, and opportunities, was a joy to behold. They were clearly excited about the new books and they were very eager to start using the new facilities at the library, and to interact with the Singapore volunteers as you can see from the photos.

But the project would not have taken off if Singaporeans had not stepped forward to volunteer and contribute their time, effort and energy. 

I have one request to make of friends: If we have more volunteers and more volunteer teachers, then we will be able to help even more children. Volunteers can be retired teachers, or teachers who are able to take some time off their busy schedules. Your assistance will greatly help the children. 

These are some comments from the Singapore volunteers: 

Dilip Kumar, Specialist Volunteer from NLB - ""It's a fulfilling & invigorating experience. The people of Jaffna are terribly sweet and accommodating.  I may have presented new programmes and skills to them but I learnt just as much if not more from their expansive life experiences.  The librarians & the students have a hunger to learn & with a little inspiration & interaction, I hope to ease their initial apprehension about speaking in English & create something really special at the Jaffna Public Library. The energy & conversation at the library would hopefully extend to the schools & create synergy that would inspire the larger community at Jaffna.""

Joanne Koh, Specialist Volunteer from NLB - ""An enriching volunteering experience for me.  The library is a place of inspiration for learning; capacity building and skills development are therefore important in boosting the competencies of the Jaffna librarians.  I am glad I can contribute in some way towards helping the Jaffna community.""

Jeganathan Thangavelu, English Language Specialist - ""The teachers are very appreciative of what we have to share with them and they were very motivated and eager to learn more.  It's been an inspiring volunteering experience for me.""

Renganathan Mariappan, English Language Specialist - ""It's heartening to get the kind of positive response from the teachers.  They were very interested in what we have to offer; there were plenty of questions asked demonstrating their desire to want to pick up more skills on how to motivate their students to converse in English."""

203314719715066_679175338795666,"I made a visit to Sri Lanka this week. An MFA Press Statement on my visit is below:

MFA Press Statement: Visit of Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Law K Shanmugam to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (2 to 5 April 2014)
 
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Law K Shanmugam made a visit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka from 2 to 5 April 2014. In Colombo, Minister Shanmugam called on the President of Sri Lanka, HE Mahinda Rajapaksa, and had discussions with his Sri Lankan counterpart Minister of External Affairs, Prof G L Peiris, and the Secretary of Defence and Urban Development, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
 
During his meetings, Minister Shanmugam discussed the positive progress in bilateral ties between Singapore and Sri Lanka, as well as various possible avenues to expand and deepen the existing bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Minister Shanmugam also signed a revised Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement with Minister Peiris.
 
Minister Shanmugam visited Jaffna and met with the Governor of the Northern Province G.A. Chandrasiri, the Chief Minister of the Northern Province C.V. Vigneswaran, and the Mayor of Jaffna Yogeswary Pathkunarajah. During the meetings, they updated Minister Shanmugam on recent developments in Jaffna. Chief Minister Vigneswaran spoke candidly about the challenges facing his administration. He said that the circumstances which the Administration found itself in, as well as the restrictions being imposed on it, were making it very difficult for his Administration to carry out its duties. 
 
In Jaffna, Minister witnessed the inauguration of several projects to help the young people of Jaffna. These included: (i) the Singapore International Foundation (SIF)’s project to enhance competency in the English language by training teachers and librarians to assist students better; (ii) a youth resource centre at the Jaffna Public Library where students can learn through interactive activities; and (iii) a mobile library which was donated by Singapore donors (i.e., the Modern Montessori International and the Singapore Ceylon Tamils’ Association).  Singapore’s National Library Board (NLB) also donated more than 10,000 books to the Jaffna Public Library.  It is expected that over 3,000 students in 38 schools in Jaffna will benefit from these projects.
 
During his visit to Jaffna, Minister Shanmugam also met the media. In response to queries on the reconciliation process, Minister Shanmugam said there were a number of facets to the issue, and highlighted two of the facets. First, was the question of finding an acceptable closure in respect to the events of the civil war which ended in 2009; and second, the redevelopment process that would be needed to help the people of Jaffna.
 
On the first issue, Minister Shanmugam said to the media that it was best for a closure to be achieved which was just and equitable, and acceptable to all the different communities, including the Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim communities. If no such closure was achieved, then a lasting reconciliation would be difficult. Singapore encourages Sri Lanka to work out a process which would seek to achieve such a closure. 
 
With regard to the second issue, Minister Shanmugam said that Singapore’s objective was to extend concrete assistance to the people of Jaffna. He recalled that during his previous visit to Jaffna in May 2012, what came through clearly was that the people wanted a better future for their children, and  they specifically asked for assistance in education and IT training. It is in this context that the various projects launched during Minister Shanmugam’s visit (viz. English language training, the mobile library and the youth resource centre) were identified and SIF was approached to spearhead the projects. Minister Shanmugam said that the programmes would have multiplier effects over the coming years, and if successful, could be built upon by Singapore and other countries.
 
Minister Shanmugam was also asked about the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Resolution on Sri Lanka. He said that there were a number of different viewpoints with regard to that Resolution. For example, among the three major countries with close links to Sri Lanka, the US had strongly sponsored the Resolution, India had abstained, while China had voted against it. Singapore was not a member of the UNHRC and did not vote on the Resolution.
 
Minister Shanmugam reiterated that it was important for Sri Lanka to find a process to arrive at a just and equitable closure to the events of the civil war which was acceptable to all the different communities.
 
Minister Shanmugam also reiterated that Singapore’s focus was to help the people of Sri Lanka, within our means and in our areas of expertise. It was in this context that the various projects were launched in Jaffna to help the children of Jaffna make a better future for themselves. Singapore will explore how it can do more in this regard.
 
The Minister also highlighted the additional ways in which Singapore was assisting Sri Lanka. For instance, some 2,000 civil servants from all over Sri Lanka have been trained under the Singapore Cooperation Programme in a broad range of fields from urban planning through to water management. SIF was also engaged in a programme to enhance healthcare education in Colombo.

203314719715066_671471122899421,"I visited two of our older residents last Friday. Mr Chan is 82 years-old and takes care of his 78 year-old wife who is ill. Mr Chan shared his concern about the medical needs of his wife, and the care-taker responsibilities if he falls ill.
 
MediaCorp Ch8 documented their story here http://youtu.be/uTrS8AwQAR8
 
I told him about the pioneer generation package. All citizens above the age of 65 will be helped. They will receive medical support for the rest of their lives. There will be compulsory insurance, and the govt will help in paying for the premiums. We have also arranged a community nurse from Khoo Teck Puat Hospital to visit them weekly. The couple will also participate in the EASE programme to install elderly-friendly improvements to their home. This will enhance the safety at home and they only need to pay 5% of the costs – the Government will pay for the rest.
 
Mr Chan is a very impressive person. He wants to be independent, told us that he was financially stable and preferred non-financial assistance. He hoped for elderly-care facilities where Mrs Chan could receive some form of physiotherapy. I assured him that we will refer him to one.
 
The visit reinforces my view that much more needs to be done to communicate the benefits to our elderly residents. The community play a vital role, but the Government too will explore all opportunities to reach out to our elderly.
Mr Chan told me that he has 5 sons."

One writer described her harrowing experience with a fellow colleague. After she rejected his advances, this colleague began spreading rumours about her at the workplace. This attracted unsavoury gossip and stares from other colleagues, causing the writer to feel very harassed for several years. Despite all that, the writer did not leave her job as she needed to support her family.
 
Another writer shared that she experienced harassment which caused her to fear for her safety as her harasser had a violent temper. 

A third writer told us that she was a victim of harassment and stalking 5 years ago and that her life has never been the same since. The distressing episodes continue to affect her till today. 

I attach the letters, with some details deleted, so that their identities will be protected. Unfortunately, the trauma which the writers went through has left an indelible deep mark in their lives."

203314719715066_666416273404906,"In Parliament today, I was asked whether Malaysia had the right to review the price of raw water sold to Singapore.  I spoke about this issue yesterday during MFA’s Committee of Supply debate. Today, I made the following points in my reply:

Our position on this issue is well known to Malaysia. We have stated this publicly, and also conveyed it to the Malaysian Government, including at the highest levels.  

Singapore’s position is that Malaysia has lost its right to review the water price.  The 1962 Water Agreement provided for the review after 25 years, and there was a right to review the price of water jointly in 1987. 

Malaysia chose not to review the price. Malaysian leaders have acknowledged that Malaysia benefits from the current arrangement, and explained that indeed that was why Malaysia made a carefully considered decision not to review the water price in 1987. It had good reasons for this.     

Malaysia benefits greatly from the current pricing arrangement.  Johor buys 16 million gallons per day of treated water back from us at 50 sen per 1000 gallons.  50 sen per 1000 gallons is only a fraction of the true cost to Singapore of treating the water, which includes building and maintaining the entire infrastructure of the water purification plants. 

Neither Malaysia nor Singapore can unilaterally change the price of raw water sold to Singapore, nor unilaterally change any of the terms of the 1962 Water Agreement.  

The 1962 Water Agreement was guaranteed by both Governments in the Separation Agreement in 1965, which was registered at the UN.  

Both countries have to honour the Water Agreement and the guarantee in the Separation Agreement.  Any breach of the Water Agreement would also be a breach of the Separation Agreement and of international law."

I spoke about the developments in Ukraine, as well as the situation vis-à-vis Indonesia, relating to Haze. 

I made the following points, and video clips on these points are available online:

Ukraine [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYS9qRhd1y4&feature=youtu.be]

• What is happening in the Ukraine impacts on all of us at several levels: 

• Potential impact on the World Economy and our economy.

• Other countries will see what patterns of behaviour are possible.  This is a situation of a standoff now between a big country and a small country.

• Several lessons for Singapore in real politics and international law.

• Have to assess Russian interests in Crimea: 

• Russia has always considered its interests in Crimea to be vital;

• Russian actions against the Ottoman Empire, in pursuance of those interests, led to the Crimean War over 150 years ago.  Russia lost that war.

• If one had stepped back and considered the matter, as Ukraine was going through its protests in the last several weeks, it would have been fairly obvious that there was a significant risk of Russia moving to protect what it will consider to be its vital interest.

• We do not know what was or was not considered by the different parties. 

• And we do not know what the P3 and EU plan to do next.  

• What is obvious now is that it is, unfortunately, Ukraine and its people who have to face the consequences 

• Singapore’s stand: 

(i) We strongly object to any unprovoked invasion of a sovereign country under any pretext or excuse.

• Russian troops should not be in Ukraine in breach of international law.

(ii) The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine must be respected. 

(iii) International law must be respected.  There can be no qualifications to this.

• Two key issues:

(i) First, Singapore has always emphasised, that big or small: 

• All countries must observe international law. 

• And we have consistently opposed invasions: 

- In East Timor, Cambodia – we have taken a clear stand, even when our views were contrary to those of far bigger powers, who were quite unhappy with us.

- Indonesia, Soviet Union were amongst those who were unhappy then.

• We take the same stand now.  

• There should not be any invasion of Ukraine. 

(ii) Second, the events in Ukraine hold four lessons for us:

• Russia had signed an agreement in 1994 with the US and the UK agreeing not to threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. 

• They also pledged never to use economic coercion to subjugate Ukraine to their own interest. 

• Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence was thus confirmed by a treaty. 

i. Lesson 1: when it comes to the crunch, treaties are only meaningful if you have the ability to enforce them. 

• If Ukraine cannot defend the treaty, and has no partners which will come to its aid - and I mean with deeds, and not just words, then the treaty by itself will not help Ukraine.

ii. Lesson 2: In international relations – Size matters.

• The disparity between big and small countries is a fact of life. 

• And a small country which cannot protect itself puts its sovereignty and its people at risk. Russia is vastly bigger than Ukraine, and its armed forces are much more powerful than  the Ukraine armed forces.

• Russia is a nuclear power. 

• Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons as part of the 1994 treaty.

iii. Lesson 3: something we have repeated many times: the Security Council cannot always act decisively to protect small countries.

iv. Lesson 4: When squeezed between two big powers/blocs, a smaller country like Ukraine can become a pawn.  

Indonesia - Haze [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2dHnpJJWtw&feature=youtu.be]

• Progress on this front has not been rapid. 

• I will highlight three points:

(i) First, ASEAN countries agreed to the ASEAN Sub-Regional Haze Monitoring System (HMS), which will allow us to better pinpoint those responsible for the haze.

• But we have not yet been able to implement the HMS, because the other parties have yet to agree to do so. 

• The credibility of ASEAN is at stake. 

(ii) Second, there was a media report on 4 March that mentioned that the majority of an Indonesian Parliamentary Commission was, in principle, supportive of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. 

• That is welcome news as the other ASEAN countries have ratified the Agreement. 

• Thus, once Indonesia agrees, the treaty can come into force. 

(iii) Third, we have had reasonably successful cooperation on the ground with Jambi Province. 

• Through a Letter of Intent (LOI) between Singapore and Indonesia, we provide assistance in technical capacity building and workshops, setting up of air and weather monitoring stations, among others. 

• This MOU lapsed in 2009. 

• We have suggested to Indonesia that we renew the LOI. 

• Our respective officials have met several times. 

• Jambi Province is keen for the LOI to be signed and for cooperation to continue. 

• This could help on the ground by providing technical assistance and capacity building capabilities to equip local farmers with alternative land-clearing methods, sustainable farming and zero-burning practices. 

• We are waiting for final approval from the relevant authorities in Jakarta, before the cooperation can be resumed."

The Governor General as well as others present felt that there was a good possibility that the international constraints on Iran could ease in the near future. He also told me that officials and delegates from several countries have been visiting, and are scheduled to visit Isfahan. As an example, he referred to recent visits by ministers from Sweden, Belgium, as well as other countries.

Isfahan is a place rich with history and culture, with magnificent buildings and is a proud heritage for all of mankind. I told the Governor General that we could encourage tourism between the countries, and suggested some ways in which this can be done."

In Tehran, I had a good meeting , which continued over lunch, with the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. 

I also called on President Hassan Rouhani, Speaker of the Islamic Consultative Assembly Ali Larijani, Senior Advisor to the Supreme Leader on International Affairs Ali Akbar Velayati, and the Mayor of Tehran, Dr Mohammad Ghalibaf.  During my meeting with the Minister Zarif we discussed a broad range of issues, including sanctions and the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 (on issues relating to Iran’s nuclear programme), developments in the Middle East as well as in Asia. Several issues were also discussed during my meetings with the other Iranian leaders. 

Progress has been made in the P5+1 negotiations, and I expressed the hope that a comprehensive agreement could be reached and which would address the concerns of the international community regarding Iran’s nuclear programme.  Such an agreement, when achieved, would be in the interests of Iran, the wider Middle East region and the international community. I reiterated to the Iranian leaders that Singapore recognised Iran’s right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy within the framework of its international obligations, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Singapore has friendly relations Iran, which have grown steadily over more than 40 years, and there is scope for both sides to enhance bilateral relations."

His Highness remarked on the close relationship between Qatar and Singapore. We discussed several bilateral and international issues. 

I also met Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Prime Minister and Minister of Interior as well as my foreign affairs counterpart, Dr Khalid Bin Mohammed Al Attiyah. The meetings were good. We discussed how the bilateral relationship between Qatar and Singapore has grown over the years, anchored by the Qatar-Singapore High Level Joint Committee (HLJC), as well as developments in region. 

I was last in Qatar in 2010, then as Minister for Home Affairs, and there have been dramatic changes in the Qatar landscape since then. Qatar will continue to grow and change, in particular as it gears up for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Qatar and Singapore share many similarities – a small land space, a small population, and an international outlook. We mark 30 years of diplomatic relations this year. 

There are many areas in which both sides can further develop. Singapore companies have already started to make their mark in Qatar, including Keppel Seghers, whose S$3.2 billion wastewater and solid waste treatment projects in Qatar are the largest of their kind in the Middle East region. 

This evening, I will fly to Iran where I will have meetings with President Hassan Rouhani, Speaker Ali Larijani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, as well as other leaders."

http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/singapore-explains-stance-ship-naming-welcomes-jakartas-overture-20140

In summary, I made these points:

(1) What happened in March 1965 -

- Indonesia was under President Sukarno
- Two marines wore civilian clothing; targeted a civilian building; killed and injured civilians.
- Part of a campaign of terror.
- Attack was illegal under international law - nothing subjective about it. 
- The two marines were tried in Court, found guilty and hanged in 1968. 

(2) What the event meant at that time between Singapore and Indonesia - 

- By 1968, and before the two men were hung, President Sukarno had lost power.
- Confrontation was stopped, President Suharto was in power.
- A new relationship was being forged.
- Indonesia asked for Usman, Harun and others to be released.
- We released 45 - two of the 45 had been sentenced to death for a bomb which exploded. 
– These two were pardoned for three reasons–
(i) the bilateral relationship;
(ii) the change in government;
(iii) no one had died in that explosion.

- Significant that this bombing occurred in April 1965, a month after the attack on MacDonald House.
- Yet we set them free.

- Usman and Harun - we could not pardon.
- Hard to answer to victims' families and to Singaporeans if we had set them free.
- Defining moment for Singapore's foreign policy.
- If we had agreed to release them - would have set precedent for our relationships with bigger countries:
That we should do what a bigger country asks us to do, even when we have been hurt.
- Would be a different concept of sovereignty.
- Decided that is not good for us.
- The men were hanged.

- Not easy decision.
- British forces were withdrawing in two years - Almost non-existent defence capability.
- But we stood firm, our sovereign decision. Indonesians were very upset; Our embassy in Jakarta was sacked.

- Within a few years, some closure.
- Both countries put aside the events of Konfrontasi. Relationship improved, now excellent, mutually beneficial.

(3) What the naming of the ship now means to us -

- Indonesia’s sovereign right to name war ships as it chooses.
- But sovereign decisions can impact on other countries.
- Here, Indonesia’s sovereign right intersected with a part of our mutual history, and mutual decision to put that history behind us. 
- Has to be sensitivity on both sides - why we asked Indonesia to reconsider naming of the warship.
- Very different signal when naming a warship - this will sail globally, carrying that message to every country.
- Difficult to proceed as if nothing had happened - why the TNI chiefs and officers did not attend the Airshow.

(4) What next -

- Welcomed FM Marty Natalegawa's constructive comments.
- Important for us to know that the marines were not being honoured for killing Singaporeans.
- Important to both understand and acknowledge that the naming of the ship impacts on our sensitivities."

_________________________________________________
 
Affordable healthcare is one of the top concerns among Singaporeans. This was clear from Our Singapore Conversation. Thus PM announced last year, during NDR, that Singapore will move towards having universal health care insurance. This will give Singaporeans  greater peace of mind on health care costs – particularly important as  our population ages. With universal insurance coverage, premium  has to go up. The elderly are likely to have less savings, and will need help in paying the premiums. 

PM Lee announced yesterday that Government will help our Pioneers, the senior citizens to pay the premiums. The Pioneer Generation Package unveiled by PM seeks to take care of elderly for the rest of their lives.
 
DPM Tharman Shamugaratnam will provide more details on the benefits in his Budget Statement. But very briefly, the package provides for following benefits

-       Medishield – more subsidies so that the Pioneer Generation can enjoy enhanced benefits of Medishield Life with significantly lower premiums.

-       Outpatient treatment – extra subsidies at specialist clinics, polyclinics an GP clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) on top of other subsidies which all citizens already enjoy

-       Medisave – annual top-ups to the Medisave accounts of the Pioneer Generation.

Those who have done well in life should always be looking out for others - especially the less well-off or needy. It is basic human decency. Instead Mr Casey showed contempt. Having money and a Porsche, does not automatically mean that one is superior. Character is important.

I am glad the community has come together
to condemn what he has said.

He has attempted to apologise to Singaporeans. But some feel that the manner of his apology showed a lack of sincerity. And I think there is some basis for thinking that.

At the same time, I hope that Singaporeans will not attack or flame his  family because of his actions. We, Singaporeans, can be bigger than that."

外交部长兼律政部长尚穆根与夫人西塔医生昨早连同基层领袖齐聚忠邦民众俱乐部，向65岁和以上的年长居民派发40元到200元不等的现金红包及礼包。其中，还包括两名百岁人瑞。

尚 穆根在受访时指出，与数年前相比，义顺集选区内的年长者人口不断增加，从800多人增长到目前超过1500人。他说：“随着人口逐渐老化，现在义顺集选区 的居民约有四分之一是年长居民，因此除了要加强医疗保健品质以及协助他们的日常生活所需，我也希望年长居民能更积极地参与社区活动，享受活跃乐龄生活。”

西塔医生在活动后受访问时说：“虽然每年出席庆祝活动的年长居民不断增加，但看见他们仍精神百倍、活力十足的模样，让人感到欣慰。”

A determined young girl, Megan Tan (10 years old), gave the key note address!!! I was very impressed with Megan’s speech.

Megan is a primary school student studying at Maha Bodhi School. She is already volunteering at ACRES – ACRES had to lower their volunteer age for her! She wrote her speech herself. I was told that Megan is a very shy girl. Thus it must have been difficult for her to stand in front of an international audience and give a speech. But she decided to make the speech because of her deep care and concern for animals .

She shared with us her journey, motivation and efforts in animal welfare advocacy which include designing and drawing creative covers for notebooks – she found sponsors for her notebooks, and will donate the proceeds to animal welfare causes! Her deep passion for animal welfare activism and determination to make a difference to the lives of animals, came through. I attach her speech (which was delivered with creative pictures at the conference). Well done, Megan!
 

_____________________________________________________

Megan's speech.


Good morning, Minister Shanmugam, Uncle Louis, and guests.
 
My name is Megan and I am 10 years old.  I am a student in Maha Bodhi Primary School.

I love drawing, watching videos, and my favourite game is Minecraft. My favourite hobby is reading, especially the Harry Potter series and the Heroes of Olympus series. And like most of my friends, I enjoy movies, especially The Hobbit. So you see, I am just an ordinary 10-year-old.
 
Another thing I really love are animals. They make our world a more fun, interesting, colourful and beautiful place. The world would be really boring without animals.
 
We can also learn a lot from animals. Many of the inventions in the world today are inspired by animals. For example, the streamlined shape of the Japanese bullet train, which enables the train to move very quickly and quietly, was actually inspired by the kingfisher’s beak. 
 
Living here in Singapore, it is easy to forget how much we depend on animals. Many people depend on animals for food. In many parts of the world, animals like horses, camels and donkeys are still used for transporting people and goods. Buffaloes still help farmers with their work in the fields. Closer to home, dogs, cats and hamsters keep us company and are friends to us.
 
Animals are also an important part of our ecosystem. For instance, we won’t have any fruits to eat if not for the honeybees and the bats that pollinate fruit trees. And although vultures look like filthy birds, they help eat carcasses and keep the environment clean.
 
Even though we depend so much on them, many animals are treated unfairly. When they get abused, they cannot defend themselves or tell us how they feel. So I think it is up to us to speak up for them.
 
I get very irritated when I see animals being treated badly. When I was 5, I watched a documentary about how people were cruel to animals. They kept animals in cages and killed them for their skin,    to make clothes, shoes and bags. Sometimes, these animals were even skinned alive! I felt really upset, so I drew this picture and stuck it outside the door of my house. I wanted people to know that cruelty did not make them more beautiful.
 
Recently, during a holiday in Australia, we visited a whale centre.    It was a museum where we could learn all about whales. Did you know that a newborn baby whale is already 5 metres long, and whales travel thousands of kilometres across the ocean every year?    I would love to see them in the wild one day!
 
From that visit, I also learnt that the Right Whale got its name because it used to be the ‘right ’ whale to hunt! Why was that so?    They moved slowly and since they had lots of blubber, they floated when they died, making it easy for whalers to collect their bodies.  Because of that, right whale numbers decreased rapidly. Now that they are a protected species, their numbers are increasing again.    But it was only because there were people who loved these animals, knew how important they were to the ecosystem, and educated others about it, that we managed to protect them.

I also found out that there are scientists who spend their lives studying these animals, to find out how to help them better.    This is one of the many examples of how we can make a difference.

I may only be 10 years old, but I have decided that I can make a difference too. Since I love drawing and painting, I want to use my artwork to help animals. With the help of my mom and dad, we got sponsorship from a generous company to create a series of animal-inspired notebooks. These eco-friendly notebooks are made with recycled paper.
 
I have drawn 4 different cover designs:
•   In this design, I wanted to show ‘man’s best friend’ and the very special bond we have with dogs.
•   This was inspired by a storybook I read, “The Island of Blue Dolphins”.    In the story, a girl became friends with a wild dog.
•   I watched a documentary about slow lorises. Many of them were taken from the wild, their teeth removed, and sold as pets.    It was wrong of those people to keep wild animals in their homes, and I was really annoyed by what I saw. So I created this painting to help send a message about these poor animals.
•  This is a border collie I met at a farm. Her name is Jess, and we had a great time playing together.
 
I hope my art can inspire people to be more considerate to our animal friends. All of the money raised from these notebooks will be donated to ACRES, so please help all the animals in need by buying a notebook.Thank you!
 
I would also like to say “Thank you!” to the following people for giving me an opportunity to make a difference:
•   Uncle Louis, Auntie Amy, and friends at ACRES, for the opportunity to speak up for the animals
•   The kind people at A’zone Corporation, for generously sponsoring the notebooks
•   My mom and dad, for their support and encouragement
 
Margaret Mead once said,  “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has”. Just one right action at a time, we can make a big difference and solve even the biggest problems.    We can make the world a better place for everyone.

Thank you!"

203314719715066_642361362477064,"There have been concerns expressed in the media recently about the ease of access to licensed moneylenders in the heartlands. I agree with the concern about not making credit too accessible. At the same time if legal access to credit is completely cut off, then borrowers will seek  loans from unlicensed moneylenders or other illegal sources. That, in fact, already happens frequently, when people are unable to borrow from licensed moneylenders or banks.
 
The basic point is this : if people need money, then they will try and find a way to borrow from someone.
 
What the law can do is to try and protect vulnerable borrowers. For example, current protections include : interest rate caps for those with annual income below $30,000, borrowing caps for unsecured loans and a minimum age of 18 years and above for borrowers. Moneylenders are also required to explain the terms of the loan to the borrowers, including all fees, charges, and interest rates. They are not allowed to advertise in mass media, and are prohibited from promoting their business through unsolicited communications.
 
These measures are on top of several criteria moneylenders have to meet before their licences are granted. The criteria includes ensuring that they are of good character to manage the business and the placement of a security deposit to ensure the proper conduct of the business. Moneylenders found to have committed offences will also have their licences suspended, not renewed or revoked .
 
Ministry of Law has also imposed a moratorium on new licenses since 2012 – meaning no new licenses have been issued since then.
 
The Ministry is currently considering additional measures to strengthen the moneylenders’ regulatory regime and to also complement the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s 12 months’ income limit on unsecured borrowings from financial institutions."

Those who penned wishes hoped for many things positive - good health, happiness and luck. Two persons hoped for ""Bad luck"", although I'm not so sure why. There were also heartwarming posts, some which read ""I would like to make my mother proud of me"" and ""happy old people"". I also observed a deep sense of pride our residents have for Chong Pang. Bryan Tan shared ""I grew up in Chong Pang. Thus I have seen it grow over the years. I am having my A' Levels this year and I wish Chong Pang and I, a successful year ahead."" 
 
There were other practical suggestions -  more cycling paths, parks, sheltered link-ways, keeping our food market. We will look into this. I am not so sure I can help with some students who hope to score certain marks at their PSLE exams but my message to them is that so long as you stay focused and study diligently, do your best.
 
I have shared before that Singaporeans are by nature, compassionate and positive. I think that has come through in this Expression Wall.

Our residents have taken ownership of the Wall, they have decorated; and want to know what we will do with it.

This Wall reflects the hopes and wishes of our residents and includes useful feedback as well. We hope to continue this initiative. We will think of what we can do with the expressions on the Wall – must find a way of keeping them.
 
Students from Yishun Secondary School, Yishun Town Secondary School and Yishun Junior College joined me in a dialogue to discuss issues close to their hearts. We spoke about education, careers, local and global challenges Singapore faces and our wishes and dreams for Chong Pang.

The students then posted their thoughts, hopes and wishes for Chong Pang on the Expression Wall.

203314719715066_628451297201404,"On Wednesday and Thursday night, I visited two foreign worker dorms at Kranji and at Nee Soon together with NMP R Dhinakaran and two senior union leaders, Mr M Ramasamy from the Sembawang Shipyard Union and Mr G Muthu Kumar from the Amalgamated Union of Public Daily Rated Workers. MP Vikram Nair joined in for the visit on Wednesday night. 

Other MPs, grassroot leaders, volunteers, NGOs and others have been engaging the workers, at these and other dorms as well. The workers needed assurance about their future. I made two main points to them: 

1. As long as they did not break the law, and continue to obey the law, there was no reason to worry. 

2. If they broke the law, we will take firm action. There will be no compromise, and we will be strict and enforce our laws to ensure that Singapore is safe and secure. 

The following points came out from my discussions with the Indian foreign workers, almost all of whom were Tamil:

1. the vast majority of them were ashamed by what happened, caused by the actions of a small minority. 

2. there were concerns about future employment opportunities in Singapore.

3. they were happy working in Singapore and wanted to continue working in Singapore – they had more opportunities and could even be sent to upgrade skills.

4. they were happy with their employers. There were no complaints about their living conditions. They knew that they could call MOM if they had any complaints – the MOM number to call was at the back of their Work Permit.

This is consistent with what the Indian workers have been telling MOM. The Indian High Commissioner has also publicly said that there was no discontent among the Indian workers when she visited the dorms. 

The number of crimes committed by foreign workers is small. Most are hardworking, here to earn a living, and know that if they commit an offense, they will be sent back. The foreign workers are critical to Singapore's growth, including our housing and public transport development plans. While we have to take firm action against those who have behaved badly, we also need to be fair to those who were not involved in the incident. 

MOM has been proactive in looking at the issues faced by foreign workers. It received some 3,700 employment-related complaints from foreign workers this year. Most were dealt with within a month. It needs to continue to look into issues relating to these workers, their living conditions and other such issues."

These allegations are quite untrue. It is a pity that such sensational allegations have been made without any reference to what actually happened. The deceased was not pushed out of the bus. He was led off the bus as it was full. He was in an intoxicated state and was causing trouble in the bus. At one stage he even dropped his pants in the bus. The initial investigations show that after he got off the bus, he ran alongside the bus unsteadily, fell under and was killed instantly as the bus turned a corner. This triggered the ensuing riot. The situation was contained by the police with 28 arrested for rioting and vandalism that day. The riot was an isolated accident arising from the unlawful actions of an unruly mob reacting to a fatal traffic accident.

He was led off the bus as it was full. He was in an intoxicated state and was causing trouble in the bus. At one stage he even dropped his pants in the bus. The initial investigations show that after he got off the bus, he ran alongside the bus unsteadily, fell under and was killed instantly as the bus turned a corner. This triggered the ensuing riot.  The situation was contained by the police with 28 arrested for rioting and vandalism that day. The riot was an isolated accident arising from the unlawful actions of an unruly mob reacting to a fatal traffic accident.  PM Lee has announced the convening of a Committee of Inquiry (COI) to look into the incident. We will get to the root of this. 

A letter has been sent by our High Commissioner to India, to Sun TV. A copy of that letter is enclosed."

I met up with Fandi in Yishun recently, at his Fandi Ahmad Academy training session where he and other coaches are doing a great job nurturing young kids into future soccer stars. We talked about our childhoods, our growing up years. We also spoke about how we can work together to help underprivileged kids in Yishun through soccer. Fandi used to live in Yishun and his mother still lives here. When we met at the stadium, it was very clear he was still the super star that everyone was rushing to get autographs. Very proud of him.
 
Congratulations to Fandi again. I am sure with his experience, his passion for the game and the support from Singaporeans, he will do a great job."

We have decided to give direct assistance and support in criminal cases to defendants. This is a significant shift in policy and philosophy from our previous position. 
 
There will be four tiers of assistance, and the government will increase its funding. More people will be eligible to get help. This is in line with the other changes being made as our society matures and changes. But we will need partnership from lawyers. Details will be worked out."

203314719715066_623984660981401,"I visited Manama, Bahrain from 25 to 27 Nov, to attend the ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Ministerial Meeting, and to make a bilateral visit to Bahrain.
 
At the ASEAN-GCC meeting, we had a good discussion on how to further enhance ties between ASEAN and the GCC. Both regions stand to benefit from greater cooperation with each other in areas such as food security, education, and capacity building. Singapore has offered to host a workshop to explore potential areas of cooperation between ASEAN and the GCC in the lead-up to the 4th ASEAN-GCC Ministerial Meeting in Myanmar. 
 
During my bilateral visit to Bahrain, I had very good meetings with the Crown Prince and First DPM, HRH Shaikh Salman Bin Hamad Al Khalifa, and with the Prime Minister, HRH Shaikh Khalifa Bin Salman Al Khalifa, and was hosted to dinner by my foreign affairs counterpart, HE Shaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Bin Mohammed Al Khalifa. Singapore’s ties with Bahrain go back a long way and have always been very warm. Older Singaporeans would remember the days when Singapore Airlines used to stop-over in Manama en-route to other destinations back in the 1970s.
 
Singapore and Bahrain are both small island states – and so we face very similar challenges, and also share a similar outlook and world view, including the need for closer cooperation between the Gulf region and ASEAN. Singapore also has an FTA with the GCC (the first FTA signed by the GCC with a non-Middle East country), and which came into force in September 2013. Approximately 99% of Singaporean domestic exports to the GCC will now qualify for tariff free concessions. Companies from Singapore, Bahrain and the wider GCC, should explore how they can benefit more from this FTA.

Went home, had a shower, and then went for a coffee with my wife, to wake me up, before going into the office.
 
While we were having our coffee this morning, we noticed a dog, trying to cross the road. Appeared unsteady, walked back and forth halfway across the road. Thankfully the vehicles stopped and let the dog walk back and forth.
 
My wife went to pick it up  (she is much better than I am at doing this – new dogs are calm when she approaches them). The dog allowed my wife to pick her up. Eyesight seemed to be not great, and seemed old, unwashed. Poor thing.
 
I went to the office, and my wife took her to the vet. The dog seems to be at least 10 yrs old. Had a big surgery done recently in the abdomen. Vet is not sure why the surgery was done – but seems to be all clear now. She has late stage cataracts. No microchip, no collar. Been on the streets for maybe about one week. She has a lovely temperament.
 
I spoke with Louis of Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES). Broadcast has been sent that she has been found. Hopefully owner will be found. If owner is not found, then we will need help to look after her – hopefully someone will come forward to help. Meanwhile Dr Siew of Save Our Street Dogs (SOS) has agreed to help.

Isabelle was born with Nager Syndrome, a rare condition that mainly affects the development of the face, hands and arms. Nager syndrome does not affect a person's intelligence, although speech development may be delayed due to hearing impairment. 
 
She went to the Singapore School for the Deaf and Balestier Hill Secondary School before graduating from ITE in Accounting. 
 
Now she is enrolled in LASALLE, studying a Diploma in Fine Arts and I have been told that she is excelling in her class. She is a talented artist, and her lecturers and peers are both awed and inspired by her drive and determination to succeed. 
 
Isabelle, despite being born with serious physical disabilities, is a true profile in courage and hope. She has not let her physical condition limit her hopes and aspirations. She gave a truly moving and beautiful speech, which I have enclosed. Her parents are very loving, caring and deeply supportive of her. Isabelle, her mum and cousin, sang together during the short ceremony. The song was beautiful to listen to, and it was beautiful to watch the family together.
 
LASALLE puts in a lot of extra effort into making Isabelle's experience and education positive and fruitful. They help transcribe some weekly lectures which are run on pre-recorded videos and disseminated to students via a portal. The school has to rush the editing of the video records in time for a party to transcribe so that Isabelle can read them to understand the tutorials.
 
I understand that MOE, for its part, has been reaching out to the special needs community to explore how to strengthen support for students who progress on to institutes of higher learning. Looking forward to that.

Wishing Isabelle and her family the best. She is a true profile in courage. Felt very moved by her."

I shared with the audience, and media, that the Malay community has made very good progress in the last 10 years. More than half the community now live in 4-room flats or larger. Our Malay students score very well in international tests, and, 90% of Malay students in P1 succeed in furthering their post-secondary education. 28% of our PMETs are also from the Malay community, up from 23% about 12 years ago. These achievements are worth sharing, and celebrating.
 
At the same time, there continues to be some social and economic issues that we must focus on and deal with. This requires a partnership between the Government (playing a key role), Malay community leaders, the Malay community, and the rest of Singaporean society. It is my belief, that such a partnership will be powerful. The community has shown how they are committed to progress and I believe they will continue to do so, together with all the partners involved.
 
The Government has given much support to the Malay-Muslim community and will continue to do so to ensure the progress of the community. Some unique features include a Minister in charge of Malay-Muslim affairs, the Mosque Building Fund, the use of Edusave in Madrasahs and others.
 
I added that, frequently, other communities do approach MPs and Ministers to ask for similar support. We would ask them not to ask for equality and explain that there are good reasons why the Government has provided the additional support. This Government, in my opinion, is completely committed to helping our fellow Malay Singaporeans compete and do well, in Singapore and internationally.
 
I am confident with the support and various aid channels available, the community can achieve further progress."

We had asked the Philippine Government what it needed, and these contributions were responding directly to the critical needs of the people of the Philippines. 

I am happy to see that the people of Singapore have rallied together in support of our friends and neighbours in the Philippines and have given generously. NGOs like the Red Cross, Mercy Relief and others have been working hard to raise pledges and contributions. I'm sure that the people of Singapore and the Government of Singapore, will continue to support in further ways.  We will see how the situation develops, what else is needed, and we will do what we can.

203314719715066_618080554905145,"I attended the IPS Conference on Harassment on Monday, where we discussed the current state of our laws addressing various forms of harassment. We focused on three areas: sexual and workplace harassment, harassment of children as well as cyber harassment. A survey by REACH showed that an overwhelming majority of Singaporeans wanted clear legislation in these areas. Conference participants were of the same opinion as well.
 
The issue of bullying among children is not new, but cyber bullying has increasingly become a worrisome trend that we have to look at. Microsoft conducted a global study last year on bullying among youth aged eight to 17, and found that Singapore had the second-highest rate of online bullying among the 25 countries surveyed, with 83 per cent of Singapore youth saying that they have been bullied online, offline or in both areas. Children are psychologically and physically less able to deal with harassment than adults, and it is our responsibility to better protect them from becoming the victims of bullying. We have seen instances where youths who had been taunted mercilessly, took their own lives in despair. Even newborn babies are not spared. There was a case earlier this year where cyber bullies called the baby of a blogger who had given birth prematurely “an alien” who should be euthanized.
 
At the IPS conference, AWARE made a presentation asking that sexual harassment (whose victims are mainly women) be dealt with more strongly. Corinna Lim from AWARE gave me a petition on this as well.
 
We discussed how the law can structured such that resorting to a criminal complaint or a civil action can be the last resort, and how, as far as possible, for less egregious conduct, we can encourage self help, with minimal legal and other costs. The legislative framework will have to support such an approach.
 
The Ministry of Law had previously been thinking about taking a minimalist approach and tweaking existing legislation. But the majority of the participants in the conference (who are experts in the field and who have been dealing with the issues for some time), strongly suggested a standalone legislation, for a number of reasons. One of them was that such a standalone legislation will have much greater impact in setting norms. We will look closely at these reasons. We aim to be in a position to table legislation early next year."
203314719715066_617310871648780,"I attended the WeCare@ Nee Soon-Ready for School event on Sunday at Chong Pang CC. Three hundred and seventy kindergarten students from low-income families received bursaries from the North West CDC to help prepare them for primary school. The National Library Board came to provide the children with an early literacy starter kit to pique their interest in reading. Young volunteers also helped out at the event. 
 
 Pre-school and primary school education is very important for a child’s development. It is the child’s formative years and a time where the state and family must place emphasis on to help them. The Government will continue to fund in part or whole and to bring different partners together to help such low income families. 

Our approach in helping Singaporeans is  based on needs – we have many layers of help for different people, depending on their situations. Much better than having one single  income criteria."

203314719715066_615805355132665,"Last week, The Business Times published an editorial on the need to strike a balance between alternative land uses and maintaining access to golf both as a sport and a lifestyle choice.
 
There is a place for golf courses in Singapore. There are Singaporeans who golf, and those who gather at golf clubs for recreation and for business. Having golf facilities also makes us a better location for business investment as well.
 
In the past, many golf courses were built over land which could not be developed for high intensity use. We are now able to make better use of some of these land. In the coming years, some golf course land will be redeveloped, to put to higher intensity uses, to meet Singapore’s land use needs.
 
Golf clubs are on leasehold land. Many of them are on 30-year leases that expire in 2021. Our approach is to let the leases expire if the land is needed for another purpose. Unlike in the past, we will not be able to find large tracts of land for new golf courses. So over time, the land allocated to golf courses will be reduced.
 
Golf clubs will be told in advance whether their leases can be extended. We plan to make an announcement early next year on our approach to lease extension for golf courses, and to let clubs whose leases will expire within the next 10 years know whether their leases can be extended.

203314719715066_608439209202613,"Last month there were two articles in the Chinese media analysing Singapore’s foreign policy: a commentary in the Beijing News on 14 September 2013 titled “What Did Lee Hsien Loong Really Say in His Speech?” and a Global Times article on 27 September 2013 titled “Singapore – 50 Years of Pitting a Small Country against Big Countries”.  While I have a slightly different perspective on our foreign policy imperatives, I found it  interesting that both these newspapers have sought to examine in some detail our foreign policy framework.  I have set out a summary of what they have said.
 
The Global Times identified Singapore's foreign policy as fundamentally motivated by pragmatism, and shaped by its geopolitical vulnerability and lack of geographical strategic depth.  It said that this was manifested in Singapore’s “balancing strategy” to survive in the space between its neighbours and major powers. 
 
The Global Times noted that Singapore faced a severe and complex regional environment when it first gained independence.  Malaysia, Indonesia and other countries had adopted anti-China policies.  Some of them viewed Singapore as the trojan horse of China in Southeast Asia.  To avoid suspicions from neighbouring countries, Singapore, despite its “cultural affinity” (with China) only established diplomatic relations with China in 1990 after Indonesia had done so in 1989.  
 
The Beijing News article cited Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s references to Singapore’s racial and cultural differences, economic rivalry and small territorial disputes with neighbours that greatly dwarf Singapore in land area and population.  It states that as a small “Southeast Asian Chinese” country in a “sea of Muslim countries”, Singapore decided that its security and development lay in becoming the bridgehead of the US’ global security strategy, in exchange for the US’ sale of modern weaponry – to prevent Singapore's potential enemies from acting rashly.  And this strategy complemented Singapore’s geographical advantage of trade routes with the continuation of the world’s free trade system. 
 
The Beijing News article also stated that many Chinese feel that Singapore as a predominantly ethnic Chinese country, sharing the same language and race with China, should unquestionably be on good terms with China and support China’s position on international issues.  The article stated that these views neglected two fundamental points: first, Singapore is a completely sovereign country; and second, Singapore has its own interests which are very different from those of China.  The Global Times noted that China’s rise is both an “opportunity” and a “difficult problem” for Singapore.  Since 2007, Singapore’s trade with China has far surpassed that with the US, and China has become a far more important trading partner of Singapore.  At the same time, Singapore supports the US’ continued presence in Southeast Asia and does not wish to see bad relations between the US and China.  Singapore hopes to keep all stakeholders actively involved in regional affairs. To Singapore leaders, it is better to maintain its own security through regional competition among several major powers than to hand over its fate to one big country.   
 
On the South China Sea (SCS) issue, the Global Times noted that Singapore’s position is neutral and closely related to its own interests. Singapore is more concerned with freedom of navigation in the SCS as it would affect Singapore’s economic survival.  At the 2011 ASEAN Regional Forum, Singapore FM Shanmugam clearly stated that restraining all parties’ behaviour in the SCS was an ASEAN issue whereas sovereignty disputes was an issue between claimant states."

I also attended the launch of Prince Mohamed's new book, ""Association"", on Monday morning. This is Prince Mohamed's fourth book, and uses traditional Southeast Asian village games like gasing, sepak takraw and silat as metaphors to deal with key episodes in ASEAN history, and reflects on Prince Mohamed's personal memories and observations about ASEAN. 

Prince Mohamed was in Singapore for the 15th Singapore-Brunei Exchange Visit (SBEV) from 27 to 28 October 2013. The SBEV is series of exchanges that has been hosted alternately by Singapore and Brunei since 1990, and promotes interactions between political leaders and senior civil servants of both countries to enhance mutual understanding and rapport through informal interactions.  

Our relations with Brunei have always been close and personal, and Prince Mohamed and I agreed that it was important for the younger generation of political leaders and officials to meet and interact more often to continue this close relationship. Singapore and Brunei have been cooperating in many areas, and there are frequent high-level interactions and discussions.

203314719715066_607713635941837,"This morning I spoke to lawyers from around Asia, at the LawAsia Conference. I shared with them two key new initiatives that my Ministry will be looking at to strengthen Singapore's position as the leading legal centre in Asia : (1) ensure that Singapore provides first rate mediation services for international commercial disputes; (2) look at the possibility of setting up the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC).
 
International Mediation
 
We have been very successful in making Singapore a leading international arbitration centre, as a result of a number of steps taken in the last few years. Singapore is now the third most preferred seat of arbitration in the world, and is the premier centre in Asia. Key ingredients of our success include our being a neutral third party venue, our sound legal infrastructure and open environment. We will continue to innovate and concentrate our efforts in the arbitration space as the caseload as well as value of arbitration disputes rises. Even though we have an open environment, Singapore lawyers were involved in at least 75% of the international arbitrations.
 
I believe that we can replicate our success in the arbitration sector, and use similar strategies to build Singapore into a leading international mediation centre ("" ICM ""). My Ministry has formed a Working Group on ICM. The Working Group will explore the establishment of a new, independently-run mediation centre. They will consult leading international mediators, on the setting up of this centre. They will also recommend on the  necessary changes in legislation to create the right environment for ICM to take off in Singapore.
 
SICC
 
Singapore's Judiciary has a strong reputation internationally, and we have a strong Common Law tradition. People trust Singapore. In Asia, there are currently no international commercial courts like those  in London and Dubai that parties can turn to should they wish to take up commercial litigation.
 
I have set up a Committee chaired by MinLaw Senior Minister of State Indranee Rajah and Justice of Appeal V K Rajah to look into the possibility of establishing the SICC, which we believe can become a premier forum for court-based commercial dispute resolution in Asia. The SICC, if it is established, can help deal with disputes which will arise, in the context of increasing cross-border commercial activity and the increasing complexity of commercial transactions."

Headline: Lawyers to settle matter: Shanmugam
 
By Maryam Mokhtar

THE issue of Tammy, the ""aggressive"" seven-month-old mongrel put down by her owners, is now being dealt with by lawyers, Law Minister K. Shanmugam said yesterday.

After weighing in on the controversy last week, he said that it ""should be for them to look at and advise the parties"".

Speaking to reporters at an active ageing carnival in Yishun, Mr Shanmugam said many people had written posts on his Facebook page about the issue.

""People know that I'm a sympathiser in terms of animal rights,"" he said.

""They sent a petition to me, lots of people have been writing to me, and I just set out the facts.""

In a post last Wednesday, the minister said that animal welfare volunteer Ada Ong, 35, who found Tammy a home with adopter Alison McElwee, ""should get a lawyer to pursue the matter"".

He was responding to online criticism over Ms McElwee's decision to have Tammy put down earlier this month.

Explaining his post yesterday, Mr Shanmugam said: ""Now, I am a lawyer, I have some views. I gave her my views. Of course, I don't want to go in public to say what my views were. Looking at the facts that she gave me, I felt that I should ask her to see a lawyer.""

He added: ""Right is right, wrong is wrong. Now that we have asked lawyers to look at it, I should not comment.

""But when I see something that is happening that I feel needs to be dealt with, I do my best to go in and help.""

A veterinarian at The Animal Clinic agreed to euthanise the dog after it allegedly bit Ms McElwee and her children and ""was aggressive"" during examinations.

But professional dog trainer Ricky Yeo, who worked with Tammy for three sessions between July and August, said he had not detected ""any signs of aggression during the training sessions"".

Mr Shanmugam was speaking to reporters at Nee Soon GRC's Active Ageing Carnival yesterday. It was also attended by fellow Nee Soon GRC MPs Lim Wee Kiak, Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Lee Bee Wah and Patrick Tay.

More than 2,000 residents attended the event, involving a mass workout, brisk walking and dance performances.

There were also booths promoting interest groups, health and fitness tips and games.

The JMC is a regular meeting co-chaired by the two foreign ministers of India and Singapore, and a useful platform for both sides to take-stock of the progress in the bilateral relationship and explore new avenues for cooperation. Overall, our bilateral relations at all levels and in all fields - from economic to culture through to defence, are excellent. Our bilateral trade is worth some US$24 billion, and just under a million Indian visitors came to Singapore as tourists last year. 
 
I decided to hold the JMC this year at the Pinnacle@Duxton - this was the first bilateral meeting ever held there and it was a useful opportunity to share a little bit of our public housing experience.  Minister Khurshid and I had a very good meeting, and we discussed a broad range of issues and further areas of cooperation, including the Delhi-Mumbai corridor that’s coming up and how Singapore companies could participate.

Hi,

I am a resident of blk xxx, Yishun Ave 5. My unit is  xxxxx. I had called a few times to TC and EMS on the invasion of red ants outside the lift lobby of my unit. A lady, Jennifer from EMS was extremely helpful and responsible in following up with me. I had called several times this morning as the ants have started to crawl over to my neighbour's unit.

Please take immediate action to rid the ants once and for all. Attached is a photo taken this morning at 9am after the pest control came at 7am.

The situation started a few days ago  with a few ants, and we had sprayed insecticide but it was ineffective.

I have also killed a spider that is abt half the size of a sparrow's body, at my kitchen toilet,  jumping in from the toilet window. Its dead body is still lying in the toilet.

We are very concerned as to how the red ants which usually do not climb from the grass patches at ground floor to 12th floor. And the spider which is more common in grassy places, find its way to the 12th floor.

I appreciate that the TC will take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of my family and that of my neighbour.  Please take immediate action and not wait till the situation becomes worse.

There was a month that I missed out paying conservancy fees and a demand letter threatening legal actions was received. If you expect prompt payment, I would like to expect the same prompt action from the TC to eradicate the ant issue.

Thank you very much for your help. I look forward to an ants free situation soon.

Best regards

203314719715066_593931910653343,"I spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly 68th General Debate in New York. Here is the full text : 


 
SECURING OUR COLLECTIVE FUTURE THROUGH POVERTY ERADICATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
 
 
Mr President,
Secretary-General Ban,
Dear Colleagues,
 
1        Allow me to warmly congratulate Your Excellency Mr John Ashe on your election as President of the 68th General Assembly, and wish you success during your term.
 
 
Mr President,
 
 
2        Over the last decade, the world has experienced a string of crises. Development has slowed. Confidence in the global economic system has been shaken. There are signs of recovery but growth remains anaemic and uneven. Unemployment is high in many countries, particularly among the young. This has exacerbated problems like increasing poverty levels, widening income gaps, social instability and a decline in public trust in governments and institutions. Extreme poverty remains a major concern in many parts of the world.
 
 
3        Violence and conflict are as great a threat to global stability as poverty.  The international community must respond firmly to such threats. In this regard, Singapore welcomes the unanimous adoption of UNSC Resolution 2118 on the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria.  We strongly condemn the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, which constitutes a violation of international law.  We remain deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Syria, and hope that Geneva II will be convened quickly to find a political solution to end the conflict and violence.   We also offer condolences to the government and people of Kenya over the brutal attacks in Westgate Mall – a painful reminder of the need to remain vigilant against terror.  All countries must unite against violence and terror in order to create an environment in which sustainable development can be pursued.
 
 
4        The global eco-system is also under stress from the transnational effects of human developmental activities. Human progress has come at the expense of environmental degradation and climate change. Deforestation, desertification of land and transboundary pollution of the sea, land and air, degrade our quality of life and threaten human civilisation.
 
 
THE IMPORTANCE OF POVERTY ERADICATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 
5        We cannot go on with business as usual. We need to re-think, re-tool our economies and societies, and place poverty eradication and sustainability at the centre of our developmental agenda. The President’s choice of “The Post-2015 Development Agenda: Setting the Stage” as the theme for this year’s General Assembly is therefore particularly timely.
 
 
6        The 1987 Bruntland Commission of the UN defined sustainable development as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. This should remain our guiding principle as we negotiate the Post-2015 Development Agenda.
 
 
7        The UN has a critical role in the evolution of this Post-2015 Development Agenda. Only the UN, with its universal membership and access to global data, has the standing to establish a new global development agenda that is inclusive, effective and adaptable. The UN has adopted an inclusive and multi-stakeholder approach to gather the views of member states and harness the energy from civic society. Several mechanisms, including the High Level Political Forum, the Open-ended Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, in which Singapore is participating actively, and the Working Group on Sustainable Development Financing, have been set up. We strongly encourage the UN to demonstrate leadership and weave these strands of discussion into a single, clear framework.  This will allow member states to focus their attention and prioritise their resources to meet the critical challenges.
 
 
SINGAPORE’S APPROACH TOWARDS DEVELOPMENT
 
8        Singapore understands very well the importance of poverty eradication and sustainable development in securing a country’s future. When we became independent in 1965, we faced several challenges. To uplift our population, which only had a small number of skilled workers and graduates, the government focused on education and skills development. To create jobs and alleviate poverty, we also gradually moved our industries up the value chain towards higher-skilled, innovation-focused sectors. Given Singapore’s land and resource constraints, sustainable development was a necessity, not just a slogan. At 700km2, Singapore is slightly bigger than Manhattan but smaller than the five boroughs of New York. To ensure that our city state remained liveable, we had to ensure that our policies on housing, infrastructure, transport and the environment were well-integrated into a long-term and holistic vision.
 
 
9        Over several decades, we have managed to pursue growth whilst preserving a good living environment. For instance, despite being densely populated and highly urbanised, our greening efforts have resulted in more than 50% of Singapore being covered by vegetation. The Singapore Botanic Gardens, founded in the 19th Century, is the only city botanic garden in the world to include a tract of original, primary rainforest.  And despite our rapid development, we have managed to preserve much of our biodiversity; one of our nature reserves, Bukit Timah, contains more plant species than the entire North American continent.
 
 
10      We have also developed creative solutions to overcome some of our resource constraints. Take the example of water. Singapore now imports slightly more than 40% of our water needs. To meet our drinking and industrial needs, we use a variety of methods, including collecting water through reservoirs, desalination of seawater, and cutting-edge membrane technology to reclaim waste water into high-grade, ultra-clean water, which we call NEWater. When Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon visited Singapore in March last year, he was impressed enough by our water management to make a toast with NEWater, rather than wine, calling NEWater, and I quote, “something far more valuable – the elixir of life”.
 
 
PRIORITY AREAS FOR POST-2015 DEVELOPMENT AGENDA
 
11      Let me now turn to the Post-2015 Development Agenda and suggest three priority areas.
 
 
12      First, we should learn from the example of the Millennium Development Goals. We should avoid being prescriptive.  As each country is unique, countries should be allowed to exercise flexibility in which goals they choose to prioritise and how they will achieve them. The new global development roadmap should have poverty eradication and sustainable development at its centre and should converge around a single clear set of practical and quantifiable goals. We should keep to this outcome-based approach, and not forget that the core purpose of the Post-2015 Development Agenda is to improve the lives of people. Today, 1.2 billion people still live in extreme poverty. That is a staggering figure.
 
 
13      Second, we should emphasise urban management and the intertwined issues of water and sanitation. According to UN Habitat, more than half of the world's population live in urban areas. By 2050, 7 out of 10 people will live in urban areas. Many cities are already under strain. More than 2.5 billion people lack access to basic sanitation and another 800 million do not have safe drinking water. 2,000 children die every day from diarrhoea. The crisis will be exacerbated as more people move to crowded cities where the infrastructure cannot grow fast enough to support them. Singapore tabled a resolution in July which was adopted by the General Assembly to designate 19 November as World Toilet Day. We hope that this will encourage countries to take a close look at how the nexus of urbanization, water and sanitation can be better managed.
 
 
14      Third, it is important for the views and concerns of small states to be incorporated in the Post-2015 Development Agenda. Small states form more than half of the UN’s membership. Many, especially Small Island Developing States (or SIDS), are among the more vulnerable members of the UN family.  Singapore identifies closely with our fellow SIDS countries’ urgent concerns.  The Third SIDS Conference in 2014 will be an important milestone, and Singapore has participated actively in all the preparatory meetings so far.  At last year’s inaugural Conference on Small States, which was organized by the Forum of Small States (or FOSS), Secretary-General Ban agreed that small and vulnerable states deserve special attention. Singapore will continue to work with the members of FOSS to share the perspectives of small states and ensure that our views are factored into the evolution of the new global development roadmap.
 
 
SHARING SINGAPORE’S DEVELOPMENTAL EXPERIENCE
 
15      Although we are a small country, we will continue to play our part in assisting other countries in poverty eradication and furthering the agenda for sustainable development. We established the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) in 1992 to share our developmental experience with our friends - both our successes, and our failures.  We believe that technical assistance and capacity building is more effective in creating the right conditions for growth.
 
 
16      More than 80,000 government officials from 170 countries have received training under the SCP in diverse areas like sustainable urban development, water management and human resource development. To support our engagement in the Post-2015 Development Agenda, we will develop and customise new programmes on sustainable development and climate change that meet the needs of SIDS and least developed countries.
 
 
17      Singapore has also been working with other governments to promote sustainable development internationally. In 2007, Singapore and China embarked on a joint project to develop the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, which is envisioned to be a city that will be “socially harmonious, environmentally-friendly and resource-efficient”. This will become a model for sustainable urbanisation in China. By 2020, the Eco-City is intended to be a low-carbon green living environment about half the size of Manhattan which will house around 350,000 people. Singapore will continue to share our experience in sustainable urbanisation, through Singapore-led events such as the biennial Singapore International Water Week and the World Cities Summit.
 
 
18      The only way to secure our collective future is through poverty eradication and sustainable development. The next two years will be critical for the world as we embark on an ambitious journey to map out the Post-2015 Development Agenda. The UN must play a leadership role, and we are fully committed to, and will work closely with member states, to achieve this."

I had good discussions with them. It was good to hear their views on global trends and challenges on a broad range of issues ranging from the commercial landscape, legal services industry, arbitration, in-house legal functions among others.

I was hosted to dinner by my Canadian counterpart, John Baird, and also met with Senator Victor Oh and MPs Brad Butt and John Carmichael as well as the President of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency and Chair of the Arctic Council’s Senior Arctic Officials Patrick Borbey.

My visit was in part to express Singapore's appreciation for Canada’s support of our successful application for Observership in the Arctic Council. We worked very hard to become Observers in the Council. 

We wanted to become Observers for a number of reasons. We are a country heavily reliant on shipping. The opening of the Arctic route would be a major development in the shipping sector. Thus it would be important for us to closely observe developments in the opening up of the Arctic route. We are also a low-lying, small island. Melting of polar ice could have implications for us. 

We have emphasised that as Observers, we will provide useful inputs into a broad range of maritime issues, including rules on shipping, dealing with oil spills (we have expertise in this area, and would be relevant for the Arctic area) and issues of biodiversity. 

I also discussed ways to strengthen ASEAN-Canada cooperation, as Singapore is the current country coordinator of the ASEAN-Canada Dialogue Relations. We have a long-standing relationship with Canada, and the Arctic Council and ASEAN highlight how we have always worked well together in areas of common interest."

203314719715066_587755037937697,"I made a three-day official visit to Peru from 11-13 Sept, after my visit to Strasbourg earlier in the week. It has been an very good visit, with good outcomes for both singapore and Peru. I called on the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala. I also met with the Prime Minister, Juan Jimenez Mayor, as well as the Foreign Minsiter, Eda Rivas, the Minister of Economy and Finance, Miguel Castilla, the Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism, Magali Silva, the President of the Congress, Fredy Otarola, and the President of the Congress Foreign Affairs Committee, Martin Belaunde Moreyra.

After my discussions with the Peruvian Ministers and the President, both sides have made a commitment to restart and complete negotiations on an Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) soon. We also agreed on the importance of bringing into effect an air services agreement (ASA). 

Our economic relations with Peru have been growing, particularly since our free trade agreement came into force in 2009. Of the 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Peru is our third-largest investment destination, with our investment at 2011 worth over $680 million. Singapore-based companies have established a presence in Peru and include Olam, CrimsonLogic, ST Telemedia, Boustead Singapore, PIL and APL. 

The DTA and ASA will complement our FTA with Peru, and help to boost business opportunities and people-to-people links between Singapore and Peru. There is scope for both countries to do much more. Singapore companies will benefit greatly from closer links with Peru, which can act as a gateway for business opportunities in Latin America. Likewise, Peruvian companies which are exploring business opportunties in Asia can use Singapore as a springboard into the region.

The primary purpose of the meetings was to ask the MEPs to support the EU-Singapore FTA that has been negotiated. I met MEPs from a cross-section of political groups in the European Parliament. 

We have deep and long-standing cooperation with the EU. Our economic links are particularly strong. For instance, Singapore is the EU's second largest Asian investor after Japan. Our total foreign direct investment stock in the EU was worth S$47 billion in 2011. The EU is also Singapore's largest foreign investor, with an FDI stock worth more than S$192 billion. There are also 9,300 EU companies and some 42,000 EU Nationals in Singapore.

An FTA between Singapore and the EU will benefit Singaporeans as well as the EU. It will increase trade and investment.

We received good support from our FTA from the MEPs. I hope the FTA can be ratified soon. 

I left Strasbourg on Tuesday, after the last meeting ended at about 4.30 pm."

China’s dialogue partnership with ASEAN is probably one of the strongest of our dialogue partnerships. ASEAN is China’s third largest trading partner and China is ASEAN’s largest trading partner. We discussed enhancing the ASEAN-China FTA,  increasing transport connectivity, about an infrastructure fund to build up ASEAN and other initiatives - China, Singapore, ASEAN as a whole, will all benefit.
 
We also discussed issues relating to the South China Sea disputes. We need to find a framework to try and manage those disputes. Official talks on the Code of Conduct next month is a step in the right direction."

203314719715066_580617561984778,"David Rothkopf, CEO and Editor-at-Large of Foreign Policy magazine, recently wrote this article ""America needs to learn from Asia or get used to following it''.

In the piece, Rothkopf painted a stark picture of how American policymakers are now falling behind in terms of 
creativity and vision to their Asian counterparts. On his tour of several key countries in the region, the American editor said his Asian friends mentioned repeatedly about the political dysfunction and distraction in Washington and wondered whether or not it is still possible for America to lead as she once did.
The Americans leaders are too caught up with domestic political opponents to consider longer term challenges and solutions.

Interestingly, Rothkopf who wrote his piece from Singapore said this about us :

""As a small island economy, it feels the constant need to reassess and reinvent itself in ways that more self-sufficient economies do not. And some of its recent innovations are particularly striking. For example, the country has just concluded an unprecedented ""National Conversation,"" a series of some 600 local meetings in which politicians did something very uncharacteristic for their professional counterparts in the United States -- they listened. These were not staged town-hall meetings but workshops in which local citizens not only grappled with complex policy issues but worked to find solutions the government might actually put to use...Still, it's hard to imagine taking this kind of approach in a country like the United States and not just because of our size. How many Americans know or care enough about core issues of public policy to come together to tackle the big questions we face? How many politicians and executive branch officials would take the time to really hear what they were saying? We often talk about participatory democracy, but can we really envision such innovative participatory policymaking happening in America today?''

It is important we take the key messages directly to the people, right at their door step. We need to make sure our fellow Singaporeans, know the points, and how they can benefit from it. I have therefore started going “roadshows’’ in our constituency to explain the policies and the benefits to them.
 
We also get to listen to their honest feedback and constructive suggestions. Last weekend, I did four such NDR dialogues in various void decks and multi-purpose halls in our Chong Pang HDB vicinity. I found the meetings useful, the residents gave good feedback and recommendations. Over the next few weeks, we will continue to talk to our residents at various locations in the constituency.

KTP Hospital currently serves patients with acute care needs. When ready in 2015, the new 428-bed YCH will provide intermediate care for convalescing patients who do not require the intensive care services of an acute-care hospital. It will also specialise in elderly care with the set up of the Geriatric Education and Research Institute (GERI) that will help us better prepare for the challenges of an ageing population.

Healthcare remains a top priority in our Government's pledge to build a better Singapore. Currently in Singapore, we have about six working adults looking after one elderly. By 2030, it is estimated that ratio will drop to two to one. In Chong Pang constituency, we have already reached four to one, a major challenge which we must meet with every resource we have and yet maintain our tax and economic competitiveness.

 In his NDR speech last week, PM announced the landmark universal healthcare insurance where everyone in Singapore will be covered, regardless of age, and covered for life. Those with pre- exisitng conditions will also be covered. The Pioneer Generation will get help to pay for the premiums. Those in need of help will also receive financial support.

We will work with the community and help our fellow citizens meet their healthcare challenges."

203314719715066_576600422386492,"PM's National Day Rally Speech last night was a major turning point in our history. We will now take a different path, compared with the one we have taken until now. Major changes in healthcare, housing, education, and the way Singapore will develop in the future: 
 
Healthcare - PM announced universal healthcare insurance. Everyone will be covered, regardless of age, and covered for life. Those with pre- exisitng conditions will also be covered. As one person said to me, in one bold stroke, PM has completely changed the landscape. That person commented that in the US, this is still being debated, and fought over bitterly, and it shows what is possible in Singapore. Premiums will have to go up, as a lot of people who are older, or who have pre existing illnesses, are now going to be insured. The Pioneer Generation will get help to pay for the premiums. And others who need help will also be helped.
 
Housing - will be affordable to all. Most of the payments can be met by CPF. PM showed how a 4-room flat, with a price of $285,000 will be easily affordable to a couple earning $4,000 per month, with a 25 year mortgage loan. They will only pay $67 per month in cash. Many 4-room flats will cost less than $285,000. Housing is a key policy, and a key guarantee that this government gives to all Singaporeans. We will make sure it is available and affordable.
 
Education - PM announced changes to P1 registration, PSLE scoring, secondary school admissions, and the way our system works. We are trying to change some underlying philosophies behind our education system.
 
The Future - exciting changes once the RSAF airport in Paya Lebar moves to Changi, and the port moves out of Tanjong Pagar. The young people I spoke with last night and this morning are particularly excited about these plans. They can see a lot of space opening up, tremendous potential. Nearly 2,000 hectares of prime space from increased development potential for a big area around the Paya Lebar airbase area and the container ports.

Singapore will be transformed."
203314719715066_575144595865408,"Last week, I spoke at the Singapore Corporate Awards organised by The Business Times and the Singapore Exchange.

In my speech, I touched on two key issues concerning inequality – gender diversity on corporate boards and social inequality. Given the low level of women representation at key management positions, I urged promoting greater gender diversity in boards and management. Despite our high education level, women directors made up only 7.3% of the boards of SGX-listed companies.
 
As for social equity, I urged those who have done well in life to do more for the less privileged so as to create equal opportunities for all and promote a fairer meritocracy. The Government will do its part to promote a fairer society such as providing quality preschool for the less well off and transfers in healthcare, workers' training, homes, education and others. But everyone must chip in if we are to achieve a sustainable successful and fair society."

______________________

PM has said that the government will also play a bigger role to build a fair and just society. We will tackle the cost of living, including healthcare costs, especially for the elderly. We will do more to enable every Singaporean to succeed, through education and lifelong learning. We will help those from families with less get off to a good start in life, beginning from pre-school. We will foster a more equal society, by helping every family afford their own HDB flat, and giving low income workers a better deal through Workfare.In Singapore, everyone will always have a stake in this country, and ample chances to make good in life.

But remember: Each one of us must still do our best, and be self-reliant and resourceful. Because Singapore can only succeed if each one of us contributes his part. At the same time, all this is only possible if we are one united people, and not divided by race, social class, or political faction.

That is the way to build a better Singapore – together."

Last Saturday, we had a two-day “HOME for National Day’’ shopping event. This event was organised by One Dream Initiative, headed by Peter Ong, working with the Chong Pang community. Over 3,000 Singaporeans from lower income families came from all over the island and had a free private shopping experience at our club. 

Coming from the 87 constituencies, the shoppers were ushered into the CC hall which was converted into a “shopping centre’’ complete with refreshment areas, dressing rooms, mannequins, mirrors and photograph booths. Each shopper was given the chance to pick a few free items such brand new clothes, accessories, handbags and shoes kindly donated by a retail franchise. They were also surprised by the organisers with a S$100 Hong Bao each.

I was particularly heartened by how so many different parties in our community – young and old - got together in such a short time to produce something so meaningful for the less privileged in our community. All in, over 3,000 volunteers from NGOs, grassroot organisations, schools, private and public organisations helped to make this nation-wide mobilisation possible.

Bihar has recorded impressive growth rates under him, although he knows that more remains to be done. There is visible economic activity, and the place is culturally vibrant.

India is now building a new Nalanda University. It is a signature project and will bring our two regions closer.  Singapore is supporting this initiative by raising funds to build a library for the new university.  Bihar has much potential as a tourism destination.  Buddhist pilgrims in particular will be very interested in visiting Bihar.
 
I also met the Indian Foreign Minister, Salman Khurshid , and gave a speech at the inaugural lecture of the ASEAN-India Centre at the Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS)."

 In my speech, I noted that women only represented 7 per cent of the listed boards in Singapore. While we did better than some of the other countries in the region, this was nothing to shout about. We have to do something about that low participation. We need a major shift in mindset, at all levels.

203314719715066_560329484013586,"Now and then I think about the various kind, positive people, acts, behaviours I come across in life. The latest trigger for thinking about this was the Metta Convention - the fact that a group of people from different parts of the world gathered in Singapore last week to contemplate, focus on how to nurture positivity and kindness for world peace.  

There are acts of kindness happening all around us almost all the time.  Sometimes the acts are so astounding that people are taken aback, post them on Youtube. A lot of time acts of kindness go unpublicized. The powerful driving force of being a human helps us cut across differences and reach out to another person in need; sometimes a complete stranger. And all that just because he is another person belonging to  the human race.
 
In my constituency, I often observe such kindness. People helping people, shop keepers helping customers, Community Club staff going out of their way to help residents, elderly individuals looking out for each other, people volunteering their time and effort for the benefit of others.  The list goes on and on.  

Fairly recently many of us witnessed an outpouring of kindness and generosity from Chong Pang residents and Singaporeans, in general, towards a family of a sole breadwinner in sudden and unexpected need. A significant number of people and groups reached out to a car accident victim’s family to show their genuine care and compassion. They provided emotional/moral support, physical support, and unsolicited, and generous financial support within a short two weeks.  

Acts of kindness happen all around us just about all the time.  If you would care to, please share with us acts of kindness you have noticed in your life."

Qualifying senior citizens will get up to 90% subsidy. It was a successful project, many appreciated it.  

Project is done in partnership with Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities, which does very good work. The Chong Pang Social Service Hub is a place with many volunteers, and is run by Thye Hua Kwan - where we bring together many services in one place for senior citizens. The senior citizens use the place to network, form community bonds, help each other. 

They also get health screening done by nurses from Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (which is also our partner in this project). There are facilities for the senior citizens to keep fit, and also mentally alert, use computers and so on.  Chong Pang has more senior citizens than many other constituencies.

The Sermon on the Mount of course is well known, and i have always found  it powerful, and very meaningful. The relevance of the Sermon to modern life struck me very strongly , when someone explained to me how the phrases should be understood in context.

In my speech at the Metta convention, one of the points I made was : if one looks at the essential teachings in the major religions, as to how a person should conduct himself-herself, and behave, there are some striking similarities."

The ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting (yesterday) agreed with the approach, and acknowledged the importance of coming up with concrete steps to deal with the haze. We agreed to task our senior officials to review existing and recommend new cooperation measures to prevent the haze, and to report on the progress of these efforts to the Leaders at the next ASEAN Summit.  

On Saturday the three of us also agreed that Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, would establish a Trilateral Cooperative Process (TCP) whereby officials and experts from our three countries would report its progress on tackling the haze issue to our three Leaders via the FMs at each ASEAN Summit.  The reporting to the Leaders is important to ensure that the measures we put in place are being implemented on the ground.

The haze problem will not be solved overnight, but these are all positive first steps and has given us a framework to move ahead.

I had suggested this informal meeting between the three of us ahead of the main meeting of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers today. My main objective in suggesting the informal meeting was to try and reach some consensus between the three of us given that our three countries were the most affected by the haze.

We had a good and frank discussion. We agreed on a way forward in how to deal with the haze. It is likely that a good statement would be issued at the meeting of the foreign ministers. It is good that we have taken this first step to agree that concrete steps need to be taken to prevent recurrence. Of course, hereafter, implementation is key – and that has its own set of challenges.

The internalisation of Buddhist principles and applying it to daily lives is worth thinking about , for those of us who can accept Buddhist principles. 

The answer is simple, but not easy to put in practice.

If we can control our inner self and mind, if we can give up our attachments, our desires, do our duty without contamination of desire, and be calm and serene within ourselves - then, Buddhists believe that we will be better people, and much can be achieved, for the benefit of society. 

I have for some time now been quite fascinated by Buddhist philosophy."
203314719715066_555565437823324,"Together with the GRC team, I launched our Yishun Remaking of Heartland programme this afternoon. The plans will inject exuberance and excitement to our town, and make Yishun even more vibrant,  with more amenities. 

HDB has just launched the sale of site for a new integrated development. Besides housing residences and commercial retail spaces, it will include a new air-conditioned bus interchange, and the first Community Club to be located in a commercial mall when the existing void-deck Nee Soon Central CC relocates to the mall. When completed, Yishun residents can enjoy an array of shopping, dining, leisure and entertainment facilities. 

This new development will add further buzz and vibrancy to the Yishun Town Centre which has already undergone a major transformation through the provision of new and enhanced facilities:   To bring even greater convenience for Yishun residents, there will be  a new fully air-conditioned bus interchange to replace the existing one.   

A dedicated 15.5 km cycling path in Yishun to facilitate cycling and bring about greater convenience and safety to cyclists and pedestrians is underway. As part of the ongoing road enhancement works, a new road linking Yishun Avenue 6 and the dam at Lower Seletar Reservoir will be built, and part of Yishun Avenue 1 and Seletar West Link, widened. These road works which are scheduled for completion in 2015, will lighten the traffic along Yishun Avenue 2 and Lentor Avenue.

The first and largest outdoor heritage corner in Singapore, Heritage Garden@Yishun, will be located right in Yishun town. Lower Seletar Reservoir is a popular destination for fishing and water sports, so we will build the Family Bay and Rowers' Bay where you can watch the water activities from the terraced amphitheatre.

The various plans are on exhibition at the hardcourt next to Yishun MRT Station till this Sunday. Do visit the exhibition to understand more about the exciting developments that will be coming up soon. Alternatively, you may also view the updates online at http://heartland.hdb.gov.sg/yishunexhibition5.html.

Our home cannot be just about new developments and more upgrading alone, it is also about the community and its people. Together with our grassroots leaders, let’s work to forge strong neighbourly ties and friendships, and foster the kind of harmonious and vibrant environment that we would find endearing to live in."
203314719715066_555555987824269,I gave an interview to BBC on the haze. It was aired Friday morning.
203314719715066_555121797867688,"I have been asked about Ms Kirsten Han's post at spuddings.net.  Unfortunately the picture Ms Han has painted is quite untrue. To give her the benefit of doubt, she was not part of the conversation and may not therefore have had the full picture.
 
I spoke with Remy Choo whom I know and whom I have engaged with. I discuss issues with Remy - I have met him in my office, have met him for dinner, and have had phone conversations with him on various topics. Yesterday, I spoke with Remy about an article that had appeared, and told him the facts. He told me that he himself had thought that the article was actionable and contained a lot of unverifiable allegations. I agreed and told him that the article was libellious  - both of us as lawyers agreed on that point.
 
We then went on to discuss a possible meeting between some of his friends and myself. This was part of my exercise to reach out to people and discuss issues. Remy said he will try and arrange such a meeting.
 
Remy sent me an email today which pretty much confirms his views that the article is libellious, and saying that he would like to be an ""honest and forthright dialogue partner"" even if we disagree on issues where we disagree strongly.
 
My conversation with Remy was like all our usual conversations, where we shared views frankly with each other. I am surprised to see that conversation appearing in print, twisted to give quite an untrue picture."
203314719715066_555115237868344,"1. The media has asked me questions on my past directorships in Asia Food & Properties Ltd (“AFP”) and Golden Agri-Resources Ltd (""GAR"") (controlled by the Sinar Mas Group, “SMG”). These questions have been raised because one senior Indonesian official had said last week, that SMG, (which has some companies in Singapore), was among those who were burning in Indonesia, and causing the haze. 

2. There are two aspects to consider:-
 
(1)    are companies in Singapore involved in the burning in Indonesia?; and

(2)    the facts relating to my past directorships in AFP and GAR.

 
I.  Are companies in Singapore involved in the burning?
---------------------------------------------------------------

3. Senior Indonesian officials have issued contradictory statements on this point. One senior official said last week that Singapore linked companies were involved in the burning. But two other senior Indonesian officials have contradicted him and said that there was no basis for saying this.  Indonesia has acknowledged that its officials have been contradicting each other on this point, and that what is needed is a proper investigation.  SMG, as well as other companies, have also denied the allegations.  SMG has invited observers to visit its plantations to see for themselves the situation on the ground.

4. Singapore has formally asked Indonesia, through a Diplomatic Note, for evidence of any Singapore linked company involvement in the burning.  If and when such evidence is received, it will be handed over to the Attorney General to consider what action can be taken.
 

II. My past directorships in AFP and GAR
----------------------------------------------

5. In June 1996, the SGX asked me and two others (Mr Wong Kok Siew and Mr Ho Tian Yee) to become independent directors, of a listed company called Amcol, because Amcol was in serious trouble. Most of Amcol’s then directors were told to step down.  Amcol had over 11,000 shareholders, many of them Singaporeans who had invested using their CPF. The three of us were asked to go in and see how the investing public shareholders of Amcol could be helped.  Price Waterhouse valued each Amcol share at 1 cent and Amcol went into Judicial Management  (“JM”).

6. We handled the affairs of Amcol, together with the JMs.  A white knight, SMG, was eventually found for Amcol. SMG took over Amcol in 1997, using AFP.

7. AFP was then listed, and I became a director of AFP.  Based on the listing price, the original Amcol shareholders who had kept their shares got a substantial benefit – as opposed to Amcol going bankrupt and being wound up.  I did not charge or receive any fees for this work – the work was done to help the public, who were Amcol shareholders.

8. GAR was listed in 1999 as a subsidiary of AFP and I was appointed a director of GAR. 

9. When AFP was listed in 1997, I wanted to step down, as the work SGX had asked me to do, (to help Amcol shareholders), was completed.  However, SMG asked me to stay on for a period, to give confidence to shareholders, given that the company had gone through difficult times.  I agreed to SMG’s request.

10. In 2001, I stepped down from both the AFP and GAR Boards, as the transition was over and SMG had found new directors.

11. Throughout this period, I did not own any shares in Amcol, AFP or GAR.  I did my duty on behalf of shareholders as requested by SGX.  And I have never owned any shares in any of these companies.  As director of AFP and GAR, I received director’s fees, similar to other directors.

12. I have also been asked about APP Ltd.  APP was listed in the NYSE.  I had no dealings whatsoever with APP.

203314719715066_554374244609110,"I received some heartwarming stories from PA staff on the work of PA, grassroot leaders and volunteers at Nee Soon East and Canberra.  This is what they sent me : 

Nee Soon East’s YEC and RC Youth Chapters’ “雪中送炭”

Nee Soon East Youth (from the Residents’ Committees Youth Chapter and Youth Executive Committee) had done a meaningful service to the community on 23 June 2013 (Sunday) giving out the N95 masks to the needy residents (on ComCare and seniors aged 55 and above).

 This is their first collaboration outreaching to the community in times of needs, which is in line with a Chinese saying “雪中送炭” which means giving out resources in difficult times. Other than giving out masks to those needy on the list, these youths also presented masks to some elderly whom they spotted on the road side as they believe that we should not only restrict to giving mask to those on our lists but should also give to those genuinely in need. A total of 122 masks were given out for such outreach. 

Though it is their first collaboration, they did it in a very orderly manner with an action plan briefing and to do the ground work and then last but not least after service they had a debrief session by the coordinators. Overall this is a successful event. 

Some residents commented that though the PSI level has gone down but they are not sure if the haze will return. They are grateful to have received the masks.  

Quotes from Volunteers: 

“We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give” said Eric Woon (Nee Soon East YEC Chairman)

 “Distributing the mask to the needy in time of needs is indeed “ 雪中送炭” because we would not know when will the haze hit us again, given the PSI in Maur (Malaysia) hit a record high of 700” said Tan Kok Hui (Nee Soon East RCYC Coordinator)

 “Feel glad that the youths are spending their time doing something meaningful to the community in times of needs; rather than staying at home playing computer games.” John Tan (Helper) 

“Residents feel comfort and taken care of to receive the mask from the GRLs in such time of Crisis” Doreen Tan (Nee Soon East YEC Volunteers)  

 “Proud of the youths for their commitment to the community and their efficiency in carrying out the task in times of needs.  Kudos to all GRLs and staff for their swift actions and support rendered to outreach to the community” Audrey Lian (Nee Soon East Youth Staff).


Safe Zone in Canberra Zone 1 RC 

The Canberra CC & RCs opened its doors from 9am to 10pm over the last weekend to distribute masks to the needy and elderly residents in the constituency. The RCs are manned by the GRLs and volunteers who gave up their personal time to serve residents in need of this man-made crisis.

With direction given by Grassroots Adviser Dr Lim Wee Kiak  and support of Canberra CCC, GRLs worked together in shifts to provide the education to residents who walked into the RC to make enquires on the mask distribution exercise.  


 Mr Joe Ang, 44 years chairman of Canberra Zone 1 RC said ; 

“In times of need, we need to work together as a team of able-individuals to reach out to residents who are vulnerable or elderly who may not know what is happening. Keeping the RC open is one of the simple things we can do within the GRO. By allocating shifts, it enables the members to be able to contribute in a small way to better serve the bigger picture. At the end of the day, we are able to do something to help our residents and fellow Singaporeans together with the GRLs and PA Staff.”"

I also did a walkabout in the markets and coffeeshops in Chong Pang and Nee Soon South. Good to see people buzz around. 
 
Also, visited senior citizens residing in Blk 701B and distributed masks to them as part of the outreach to the vulnerable in the current haze condition. I then visited our mask distribution centre at the CC to thank the PA staff who have worked hard in the last few days in helping us to cope with the haze situation. Many of them have worked round the clock to help create centres where people can come to rest, and prepare for mask distribution. After that I visited Nee Soon South for a walkabout. 

I have been very heartened watching how Singaporeans have come together to help each other during this period, particularly those in essential services who have to work in the open and volunteers who selflessly come out to help others. Kudos to the army, PA staff, grassroot volunteers and others who come forward. 
 
We have also witnessed a lot of kindness around - like the volunteers from the Lions Befrienders who braved the haze to reach out to elderly living alone and companies and individuals who kindly donated masks to the public on top of what the Government is already doing.
 
We are in this together. All my colleagues and their dedicated teams were out this weekend to help distribute masks, explain how to use them, educate the public on the PSI readings and the haze situation."

http://www.razor.tv/site/servlet/segment/main/news/92004.html"
203314719715066_552747958105072,"Spoke to the media this morning about our diplomatic efforts in dealing with the haze problem. I made the following points:

(1) Our primary duty remains safeguarding the health and security of Singaporeans.  We cannot allow the situation to continue and do nothing and say nothing. Minister for The Environment and Water Resources Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and CEO of the National Environment Agency Andrew Tan have made separate trips to Jakarta to meet Indonesian counterparts and officials to set out in concrete terms the steps that we want to be taken. 

(2) In international law, countries have a duty to control actions within their own boundaries when such actions have international implications outside of their country. International laws such as the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development adopted in 1992 imposes obligations on countries to make sure that whatever is done within their boundaries is such that it has no impact, including an environmental impact, outside. 

(3) Next week, the ASEAN ministerial meetings are taking place in Brunei and we will discuss the haze issue with ASEAN colleagues. This problem is not unique to Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia, but it is a regional one. To stress the importance of the issue and how serious the Singapore Government is treating it, I will be accompanied by 2nd Minister for Foreign Affairs Grace Fu, who is also the 2nd Minister for The Environment and Water Resources. Depending on what steps are taken, we have to see concrete results in terms of the impact on us. We will have to decide in what other fora this has to be discussed. Raising the issue at other fora comes with implications, consequences.

(4) We will offer no refuge if the actions of companies have indeed been illegal in Indonesia and affected Singapore. There are however, serious issues of international law that need to be considered along with issues of jurisdiction as well as evidence. I have asked the Attorney-General to look into it, and we will do what we can.  

(5) The companies identified by Indonesia are operating within Indonesia.  So we would like to see strong, firm, effective action taken against them in Indonesia, because that is where they are operating.

(6) We have offered assistance and will continue to offer assistance at all levels in whatever way we can - aircraft, technical assistance, manpower, etc... Our offer has yet to be taken up. Since 1991, we have been giving assistance on training, air-quality monitoring and other equipment.  In 2005 we offered assistance of our aircraft and that was accepted then.  But this time, that offer has not yet been accepted.  

(7) ASEAN has the Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution.  All countries have signed it, but Indonesia has yet to ratify it.  

(8) Let’s be clear about the issue: this is not just slash-and-burn.  This is not an act of nature by itself.  These are actions by companies for commercial profit.  In 1997, we also had a severe impact and studies suggest that CO2 emission from the peat-fires contributed to a substantial part of the global CO2 emission in that year.  So this problem has an impact not only on Indonesia, not just on the region, but it has a global environmental impact.  Therefore, we have urged Indonesia to take decisive action.

People have asked about the difference between the N95 masks and the other thinner masks, and when they should be used. Here's a summary of the info in the various advisories:

- The effective mask is the N95 mask. It's designed to be sealed against the face. However for that same reason, it can be uncomfortable worn over a long period of time. 
- It is not necessary to wear the N95 mask indoors unless there is a medical reason to do so. Be guided by the doctor on the medical aspects.

- It is not necessary to wear the N95 mask for short outdoor exposure unless there is a medical reason to do so. Be guided by the doctor on the medical aspects.

- Use the N95 mask when there is prolonged exposure outdoors. 

- The lighter surgical masks do not filter out the haze particles. Some may feel better using them. There is no harm to use them, but it should be remembered that they would not be useful for prolonged exposure.

- The best protection is to remain indoors as far as possible. Air-conditioning helps, if available, as air-conditioners have air filtration systems. 

- The N95 mask is not certified for children, so do not use it for children. Best protection for children is to stay indoors as far as possible.

- Pregnant women should not keep the masks on for too long as they limit air-intake. Again, best protection for pregnant women would be to stay indoors as far as possible.

A special scheme will be put in place by MOH to help Singaporeans aged 18 and below or aged 65 and above, Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) card holders, Public Assistance and Medical Fee Exemption Card holders who suffer from respiratory problems and conjunctivitis because of the haze. They can see their GP and pay S$10, with the balance of the medical bill covered by MOH.

Many have given suggestions,and I thank them for that. I should perhaps make clear two points : there are two aspects to the problem - (1)  external  ; and (2) internal.  In my post I was dealing with the external : the fact that  the burning is taking place within the sovereign territory of Indonesia, and that means there are limits to what we can do under international law. That does not mean we can do nothing within Singapore. Of course not. Many people have raised questions on health care, masks, cloud seeding for rain, working out doors, what can we do to the companies which are causing this problem  - these are all valid questions. All of these relate to what we can do within Singapore, the internal aspect. Plans on the  steps to be taken within Singapore, are in place. Announcements have been made and some of the questions which have been raised, have been dealt with.The Haze Task force will make further announcements, and set out what needs to be done, depending on the conditions, as they vary. All the relevant Ministries, agencies, are on board - including Health, Environment and Manpower. PM will also chair a press conference later this afternoon."

I suppose for some people like Mr Sin, every occasion is an opportunity to make a political attack - doesn't seem to matter whether there is rationality in the comments.

I will ask Mr Sin - what more do you think we can and should do ? Look at the map, see where we are. Every country is sovereign and we cant intervene in the actions in other countries. The burning is taking place in Indonesia. What do you think Singapore can do about that? Singapore has raised it with Indonesian Ministers, and over several years, we have offered technical assistance, expressed our deep distress at what is happening, and have also raised the issue internationally. The problem recurs, nevertheless. The reality of international law, international relations must be recognised. That is what we have been saying - in every field, our size and geography means that we are often price takers, not price makers - whether it is economics,  geo politics, or the environment. But despite that we have done well, much better than bigger countries with more resources - because we have managed to deal with most situations by anticipating them. But the haze situation is quite outside our control.If Mr Sin or anyone else thinks we can do more about the haze that is caused by burning in Indonesia, perhaps they can tell us - but I suppose, for some, the temptation to direct expletives and use this occasion to attack the Govt and the PAP is too great .

Joint Statement By the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources
       
        Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Law K Shanmugam today telephoned Indonesian Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Marty Natalegawa to express Singapore's concern about the worsening haze situation.  Separately, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Dr Vivian Balakrishnan spoke to the Indonesian Environment Minister Prof Dr Balthasar Kambuaya to register our strong concerns.
 
        The Singa­pore Ministers highlighted that Singapore’s PSI had breached 150 the day before, and had entered into the unhealthy zone.  They emphasized the urgency of the situation while also reaffirming Singapore’s commitment to help Indonesia fight the fires in Sumatra. 
 
        Minister Balakrishnan requested that Indonesia share relevant information to improve monitoring of hotspots and land clearing activities. This had been agreed between Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand in October 2012.  Both Minister Shanmugam and Minister Balakrishnan referred to the claim by an Indonesian Forestry Ministry official in the media that Malaysian and Singapore palm oil companies that had invested in Indonesia may be responsible for starting the fires in Riau. They asked Indonesia to share the names of errant companies involved in illegal burning, though primary responsibility to take legal and enforcement actions against these companies lies with Indonesia as they have clearly violated Indonesian laws within Indonesian jurisdiction.
 
        Minister Balakrishnan also reiterated that Singapore is ready to continue collaborating with Indonesia at the provincial level to mitigate the haze problem, as agreed by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the recently held Singapore-Indonesia Leaders’ Retreat in April 2013.
 
        Ministers Marty and Balthasar offered their assurances that Indonesia would address the haze problem. Minister Shanmugam and Minister Marty agreed that bilateral and regional cooperation could be further strengthened to tackle the haze problem, and that Indonesian Environment and Forestry officials could discuss with their Singapore counterparts ways to better cooperate and deal with the haze issue.

What Anthony has achieved is remarkable and worth celebrating.  As fellow Singaporeans, we should share in each other’s achievements and be proud.

This new law school will focus on training lawyers to serve the needs of the community in domestic areas such as criminal and family law. I think this is a good  idea, and MinLaw will be studying this proposal carefully together with MOE. The law school will also offer conversion courses for those with external and non-scheduled degrees to qualify for admission to the Singapore Bar.

Other recommendations include increasing SMU’s annual intake of law undergraduates from 120 to 180 over three years. We will also recognise double degrees offered by scheduled universities, subject to the meeting of specific criteria. The full list of recommendations can be found in the Committee’s report here - http://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/dam/minlaw/corp/News/4th%20Committee%20Report.pdf .

Our bilateral relations with the UAE, both at the federal and at the individual emirate levels, are growing strongly. The UAE and Singapore are similar in several ways: small population, small size, international outlook, financial and transportation hubs etc...

The IWPP is one of many projects which Singapore companies are involved with in Oman. Last year, ST Engineering secured a S$880 million contract to design and build patrol vessels for the Royal Navy of Oman. 

These are all win-win projects for our companies and for Oman, and illustrate what can be achieved between two trusted partners. Oman officials have told me many times that they like doing business with Singapore because of our high standards of financial integrity and probity."

203314719715066_531251343588067,"Regarding the stray dog incident in Hougang
---------------------------------------------------

Please see AVA's posting on its Facebook page (below). AVA, in fact, worked with an animal welfare group (AWG), Noah's Ark, and asked Noah's Ark to catch the dog. But those efforts were unsuccessful. The allegations that a spiked rope was used by the contractor are untrue. The dog was wandering in the vicinity of a child care centre, and there had been several complaints. AVA had to act.

AVA is working with AWGs to try and have the dog rehomed.
All of us have a responsibility - there are parents of children with genuine concerns, there are people who get scared by stray dogs, and want the government to do something. If AVA does nothing, then it will be failing in its duty. In this case, AVA asked an AWG to help first. When AVA acts through its contractors, people need to verify the facts before making allegations. Making false allegations sensationalises the situation, but is not a responsible thing to do; and will ultimately impact on how AVA can perform its role and duties."

They also took pictures of my dogs Dayna, Bernard and Zorro who were ( somewhat !) well behaved during the session. The team at PETS Magazine did a great job of making us look good - with considerable help from the dogs and cats in the pictures!

203314719715066_530057393707462,"Many of you have written to me or attended the Chong Pang Animal Welfare Forums I’ve hosted over the past 2 years, to share your concerns with me about animal welfare issues. Many of us have discussed your concerns with MND, AVA and the Animal Welfare Legislation Review Committee (AWLRC) and have been working closely with several animal welfare groups to implement changes. 

The government has responded positively to your concerns. Today, MND announced that they have accepted all 24 recommendations (listed below) from the AWLRC including amending the Animals and Birds Act (ABA) with increased fines and jail terms, community service and prohibition orders.

This is something many of you have called for and once the Bill is passed in Parliament, it will be a significant step forward for the animal welfare movement in Singapore. There are many more issues we need to address and we will continue to work on them, and I look forward to your constructive feedback at our next Chong Pang Animal Welfare Forum.

Recommendations from AWLRC: 

1. Amend the ABA to require the owner or person in charge of the animal to comply with a duty of care for the animal. 

2. Amend the ABA to clearly define that duty of care by the owner or person in charge of the animal is meeting the needs of the animal and what constitutes the animal’s needs.

3. Amend the ABA to enable codes of animal welfare to be adopted by the government to set standards for animal welfare in Singapore. 

4. Further build awareness and understanding of animal behaviour in anyone who deals with animals. 

5. Amend the ABA to provide powers for the government to specify restricted acts to be performed on animals. 

6. Amend the ABA to make attempts to cause or subject an animal to cruelty an offence. 

7. Amend the ABA to provide powers for the government to issue directives to persons to improve the care of an animal. 

8. Amend the ABA to provide a tiered penalty structure with increased fines and jail terms, community service and prohibition orders, as well as a distinct penalty structure for corporate bodies. 

9. Implement initiatives to encourage witnesses of suspected animal welfare and cruelty cases to come forward to assist in the investigation and to testify in court. This should include publicising the type of evidence witnesses can provide. 

10. Actively raise the profile of successfully prosecuted animal welfare and cruelty cases to act as a deterrent. 

11. Amend the ABA to require operators and staff of all other pet-related businesses in addition to pet shops and pet farms to undergo appropriate training on animal care and handling. In line with this, the current training curriculum should be reviewed and updated.

12. Set a minimum age of 16 years old for buying a pet and include this requirement as a condition of licensing for pet shops and pet farms selling pets. 

13. Include presale screening as a condition of licensing for pet shops and pet farms selling pets. 

14. Increase publicity on pet shop grades, conditions of pet shop licensing and best practises, and publish cases of recalcitrant pet shop offenders to help pet buyers make informed decisions when buying pets. 

15. License commercial pet breeding activities. This means breeding activities outside of pet farms to also be regulated. 

16. License pet boarding facilities providing overnight or longer stay for pets. 

17. Implement industry-led accreditation schemes for pet groomers, pet farms and breeders, as well as pet shops. The accreditation guidelines would be above and beyond regulatory requirements. 

18. Increase stakeholder collaboration on RPO education of pet owners and would-be pet buyers. 

19. Further develop and extend mediation-cum-engagement programmes through multi-stakeholder collaboration for implementation in various areas and constituencies to help resolve animal-related local disputes. 

20. Enhance awareness and educate the public on their proper behaviours towards animals to minimise misunderstanding between pet owners and the community, and better manage animal-human conflicts. 

21. Raise awareness through multi-stakeholder collaboration on other recommendations in this report (e.g. requirement for duty of care, codes of animal welfare when formulated, new requirements relating to pet businesses, list of licensed pet boarding facilities, etc). 

22. Where feasible and appropriate, Residents’ Committees could consider setting up neighbourhood watch groups on animal-related matters, as well as organise animal welfare-related awareness activities. 

23. Align the definition of “animals” in the Road Traffic Act with the definition in the ABA. 

24. Establish a multi-stakeholder collaboration committee on animal welfare, comprising representatives from the government, industry, community, animal welfare groups and the veterinary profession. The terms of reference of this committee will be to build up mutual understanding on animal welfare through sharing of views and to strengthen multi-stakeholder collaboration to promote animal welfare in Singapore.

We sometimes meet in unusual places. A few months ago Minister Carr was passing through Singapore on a Saturday. I was spending the day in the constituency, and thus could only see him in Yishun. We thus met for lunch in my constituency, and he really enjoyed the curry meal.

ST's article is below.

To S'pore - for bright ideas and a good curry
Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr enjoys rapport with Shanmugam
 
By David McMahon
 
NEXT time you see a tall, professorial Australian mopping perspiration from his brow as he eats a Singaporean curry, look closer.

If he is seated at the same table as Mr K. Shanmugam, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Law, chances are that the bespectacled visitor is Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr.
It is not just the local cuisine that holds an attraction for him. He says he is always energised by the intellectual quality of Singapore's think-tanks.

During a brief stopover last Friday, on his way back from China, he spoke to The Straits Times about a variety of subjects.
Asked about the threat of North Korea and China's role in easing the crisis, his reply was far from one-dimensional.

""We feel solidarity with our partners, South Korea and Japan. We understand their deep anxieties. We believe China's role has been constructive and we urge all nations, especially those in Asia, to support the sanctions against North Korea. It is a gravely disturbing situation. Like Singapore, we all have a stake in it.

""Singapore has set out quite self-consciously to make itself an intellectual centre. It aspires to be a brainy nation.

""This is the country that set out to give itself centres of expertise in strategic thinking.

""I had a breakfast with some of your think-tankers this morning at the High Commission and they were just full of ideas.""

So what sort of reading material does Mr Carr, a man in pursuit of ideas and deeper understanding, carry on his long flights? Among his selection, he says, is a book brought out by United States scholars with the observations of former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew ""on China and other matters"".

In his frank opinion: ""Every paragraph is arresting and underlined.""

So I interrupt him. He actually underlines as he reads? Yes, he admits, as he checks to see whether he has the book in his briefcase to show me. He then confesses that he even folds down the top edge of some pages so he can return to certain passages of importance.

""There is a lot of value in there,"" he says of the book.
He points out that in 1988, the island republic's first prime minister told him that the perceptions of Australia being known for its ""vast spaces"" and ""sheep running over the landscape"" do not apply here.

 ""He said you can't make that assumption about the city-state. It explains, I think, the concentrated strategic focus you get here.""
Singapore holds many layers of attraction for Mr Carr. ""The reason I stop over in Singapore as I criss-cross the region is to bring myself up to date and see what the think-tanks are saying, and what my colleague, Foreign Minister Shanmugam, is saying.""

The two men met on Mr Carr's first overseas visit as Foreign Minister in March last year and obviously struck up such a rapport that the veteran Australian politician said: ""I made the point of stopping over, even for four hours, in early December.""
The two men met at the Orchid Country Club, where he says that the curry he ate was ""so delicious"".

Curries hold a special attraction. He confesses that he had a curry the night before our interview and ate a green chilli that he mistook for a green bean. He says with a chuckle: ""My mouth was anaesthetised"", and that the only relief he found was in a glass of hastily proffered full-cream milk.

I ask if he had any regrets about his revelation last week, shortly after the death of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, that she had warned him about curbing Asian immigration in an ""unabashedly racist"" manner after she left office.

Given a second chance to express his opinion, would he describe her in the same words? He does not flinch at the question. ""Of course I would. If you're a public figure and a world historical figure, you will have people examine your strengths and weaknesses. She had attitudes on race that came out of the pre-World War II empire. She almost jumped on me, saying that we couldn't allow Asian migrants to take over Australia (during a conversation) in the great hall of Westminster.

""I'm not going to airbrush out the views she expressed and that I politely term as quaint. Asian immigration to Australia has been an astonishing success story and has energised Australia.""
Our allotted time has long since ticked over but I am given the chance to ask one more question. So I choose to ask where he thinks the beleaguered Australian Labor Party will be, 12 months from now. ""We will be in government,"" he declares, ""having astonished all the naysayers and pessimists who are predicting demise.""

She led Britain through some very trying times. Britain in the 70s was in a difficult financial situation and had to be helped by the IMF. She restored economic vitality to the country, and undertook many measures to free up enterprise. She changed Britain."
203314719715066_624833850867255,"Three months after the horrific death of the rape victim in New Delhi, India recently passed sweeping reforms to further protect women in the country. According to a New York Times report below, the bill, which amends India’s criminal laws, hopes to deter and punish sexual offenders,  including men who stalk and harass women. Among the changes, the bill expands the definition of rape, substantially increases the punishment for sex crimes like gang rape, introduces the death penalty for repeat offenders and criminalizes activities like disrobing and voyeurism.


Here are some of the bill’s crucial changes (lifted from New York Times (http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/what-indias-anti-rape-bill-actually-says )
 
– Women’s rights advocates and victims of sexual offenses have long accused a male-dominated police force of refusing to register complaints by women, and even facilitating a monetary settlement or brokering a marriage between victims of rape and the accused.
The bill lays down punishment for police officers who fail to record the initial complaint, known as the first information report, of a woman who alleges she was attacked with acid, assaulted by a man who intended to molest her or “outrage her modesty,” stripped naked or raped. Such officers can receive jail terms of six months to two years.

– The bill creates a separate offense to address acid attacks, common in South Asian countries, especially by men who are spurned by women they express an interest in.
Under the bill, those convicted of throwing acid on a woman, causing “permanent or partial damage or deformity,” or maiming or disfiguring her, will be punished with prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life and a fine.
With an eye to the rehabilitation of the victim, the bill says the fine should be paid to the woman as compensation.

– The bill defines sexual harassment, which includes “physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures,” a demand for sexual favors and showing pornography to a woman who does not want to see it. Those convicted of harassment can receive prison sentences of up to three years.
Making “sexually colored” remarks is also included in the definition of sexual harassment, for which the bill prescribes a prison sentence of up to a year.

– The bill criminalizes the forced stripping of women, or disrobing, in public spaces or in private confines, with a minimum jail term of three years and a maximum of seven. Under the current law, disrobing a woman is not a separate offense.

– One of the more controversial provisions in the bill is the section on voyeurism, which seeks to punish men who watch or photograph women who are conducting a “private act,” such as bathing, using the toilet or having sex.
The bill lays down a punishment of three to seven years in prison for those convicted of voyeurism more than once.
Voyeurism is not a separate offense under the current law.

– The bill creates another new, and much-debated, offense: stalking. This provision deals with men who follow a woman and establish contact with her or attempt to do so “to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest” by the woman.
E-stalking, or monitoring of a woman’s activities online, such as browsing or checking of e-mail, has also been made punishable.
A man convicted of stalking once can be sentenced to a term of up to three years, and if convicted again can receive a sentence of up to five years.

– The bill expands the definition of rape to include not just penovaginal intercourse but the insertion of an object or any other body part into a woman’s vagina, urethra or anus, and oral sex.
This responds to a longstanding demand of women’s rights groups. The issue of rape by different means was highlighted in the Delhi gang-rape case, where an iron rod was inserted into the young woman’s body.
Prison sentences for rape can range from seven years to life. The current law allows courts to hand down a sentence of less than seven years for “adequate and special reasons,” a provision omitted in the bill.

– The bill raises the age of consent for sex to 18. This means that intercourse with a woman under 18 is statutory rape and courts conducting rape trials cannot consider whether the woman consented to having sex. It also, in effect, criminalizes consensual sex with women under 18, a subject of much controversy.

– The bill does not make marital rape an offense, ignoring a longstanding demand of women’s rights advocates.

– The bill takes a tough stand on rape by public servants. Under the current law, when a rape is committed by a police officer or prison staff, those convicted can be punished with sentences ranging from 10 years to life.
The bill clarifies that imprisonment for life means the convict must remain in prison till the end of his natural life.
The bill also allows women to bring a complaint of rape against members of the armed forces.

– When a rape leaves a woman dead or in a “persistent vegetative state,” the bill demands a minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum punishment of death. This is the first time that the death penalty is being prescribed for sexual offenses in India, which, unlike nearly all European nations, retains the death sentence, but uses it only in the “rarest of rare cases.”

– The bill increases the minimum punishment for gang rape from 10 years imprisonment to 20 years, and the maximum punishment to life imprisonment.

– The bill provides for life imprisonment or death for repeat offenders convicted of rape and gang rape.

– The bill makes procedural changes to address concerns that women are uncomfortable or intimidated by male police officers, or are treated with insensitivity when they approach police stations to register complaints of sex crimes.
The bill requires that all initial reports involving sexual harassment, disrobing, voyeurism, stalking, rape and gang rape be taken by women officers only.

– In order to ensure speedy trial, the bill requires that rape trials be completed “as far as possible” within two months from the time the police file charges against the accused."

Some of the key points that I made in my speech: The external environment for 2013 will continue to be challenging because fragile international economic and financial situation will persist.
 
Will be important for ASEAN to regain unity and credibility by realising community-building targets by 31 December 2015, remaining relevant and effective, and retaining its central role in the regional architecture, particularly in the East Asia Summit (EAS).  Brunei’s Chairmanship this year will be crucial. Singapore strongly supports Brunei and will work closely together with others to ensure its Chairmanship will be a success.
 
Also spoke about the US-China relationship as the defining relationship for the region and the world. It is in the region’s interest to keep both US and China engaged in our region in a collaborative manner, accommodating each other’s and the region’s interest to enhance peace and stability in the region.
 
Minister Grace Fu, SMS Masagos Zulkifli and SPS Sam Tan also spoke about our engagement with Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as our Singapore Cooperation Programme, and our consular assistance to Singaporeans in their speeches during the COS.

203314719715066_558556650843727,"Nobel winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has written a piece in the New York Times on lessons that the US can learn from Singapore and Scandinavian countries on how to manage inequality. In the piece, Stiglitz described Singapore of having the distinction of having prioritized social and economic equity while achieving high rates of growth over past 30 years – “an example par excellence that inequality is not just a matter of social justice but of economic performance’’. He noted there were many things that Singapore did to become one of the Asia’s economic tigers and curbing inequalities was one of them. The government, he said, made sure wages at the bottom were not beaten down to the exploitative levels they could have been.
 
In the article, Stiglitz pointed that there are at least four distinctive aspects of the Singapore model and “they are more applicable to the US than a sceptical American observer might imagine’’. First, Stiglitz noted individuals were compelled to take responsibility for their own needs, pointing to Singaporeans’ CPF savings and high home ownership. Second, Singaporean leaders realised they had to break the pernicious, self-sustaining cycle of inequality that has characterized so much of the West. Not only did those at the top pay their share of the public investments, they were asked to contribute even more to helping the neediest, Stiglitz said. Third, the government intervened in distribution of pre-tax income to help those at the bottom, rather than, as in the US, those at the top. The government, he noted, weighed in gently on the bargaining between workers and firms, tilting the balance toward the group with less economic power. Fourth, Stiglitz said Singapore realised that the key to future success was heavy investment in education and more recently, scientific research. National advancement, he noted, would mean that all citizens – not just the children of the rich - would need access to the best education for which they were qualified. Stiglitz also singled out the republic’s efforts on the environment, making sure the city retains its green spaces even if that means putting them on the tops of building.  The country also instituted housing programmes to help its aging population.
 
Stiglitz said economic forces are global and the fact that there are such differences in outcomes ( both levels of inequality and opportunity ) suggests that what matters is how local forces – most notably, politics – shape these global economic forces. Singapore and Scandinavia have shown that they can be shaped in ways to ensure growth with equity."

I met with the new Secretary of State John Kerry, and we had a good discussion on a broad range of issues. We reviewed the close and multi-faceted Singapore-US bilateral relationship, as well as cooperation in regional and global engagements. We also talked about the importance of a stable and collaborative US-China relationship, and that this would be in the long-term interest of both governments. Had also discussed similar issues with Deputy National Security Adviser Michael Froman and Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, and other senior administration officials.   I also met my American MinLaw counterpart, Attorney-General Eric Holder, and we had a good exchange of views on legal issues, and discussed ways to strengthen bilateral legal cooperation.   Had good meetings also with few members of congress, including Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Bob Menendez and Ranking Member Bob Corker, Ranking Member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs Elliot Engel, and Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific Steve Chabot. I also had a meeting with Senator John McCain, as well as with Senator Max Baucus with whom I discussed the on-going investigations into the Shane Todd case.   Our relations with the US are very warm and long-standing, and we have a good relationship at all levels. The US' continued engagement with the region is important not just for Singapore, but for the region as a whole. Initiatives like the Trans-Pacific Partnership for instance would bring huge benefits to all sides."

We reformed how the mandatory death penalty is applied by giving the court discretion in selected situations in drug trafficking and murder cases, expanded legal aid coverage for the lower income group, and took steps to further strengthen  our legal services and arbitration sector.
 
One of the areas of focus for MinLaw in 2013 was  the review of the bankruptcy and insolvency regime. We have started looking into our discharge policies, to see if we can have a differentiated regime applied for the different groups of bankrupts. In doing so, we will try to balance between bankrupts’ interests and creditors’ interests, while being mindful of the issue of moral hazard.
 
Community disputes is another area. We will work with MND, MHA and MCCY to develop a suitable framework for this.

A successful Malay community is vital and essential for Singapore. The Government must continue to give its support to ensure the community's continued success. I will be having a discussion on the issues and challenges facing Singapore and the Malay community at a dialogue session organised by the Centre for Research on Islamic and Malay Affairs (RIMA), in collaboration with its parent organisation, the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP), at its Community in Review (CIR) seminar at Orchard Hotel tomorrow morning."

I took part in the dialogue together with my fellow Nee Soon GRC Grassroots Advisers. About 300 women turned up for the event, participated actively  in the dialogue, raised important topics such as single mothers, maids’ levy, foreigners at work and other national issues.

We also spoke of the need to look at the factors that are holding women back from doing  better in the corporate sector to see what can be done about that. While the labour force participation rate for women in Singapore is good, the board representation of women is very low here, at about 7 per cent.  The representation of women in executive committees in Singapore companies is also low, at 15 per cent. 

Women have done well in the professional sectors such as law and medicine, but their performance in the corporate sector has been held back by several factors. Need to deal with these."
203314719715066_510079945705207,"On Sunday, I launched the Chong Pang Social Service Hub (CPSSH) at Blk 131, Yishun St 11. This is an important community collaboration for the benefit of the elderly. 

Today in Singapore, we have about 6 working persons supporting 1 elderly. If we do nothing and at current replacement rate, this support ratio could plunge to just 2 persons looking after 1 by 2030. This has very serious implications for us all, especially our younger people - they will be the working population which primarily supports the aged population. Together, we will face many challenges : increased demand for healthcare services, family and social issues. Will be difficult to retain taxes at the current low levels. And if we are not careful, with a reduced working population, economic vibrancy could be affected - which means impact on jobs, incomes. In Chong Pang today, we have 1 in 4 persons who are elderly. At the national level, we have 11 in every 100.

 The Government will increase spending on healthcare services and elderly care. But we need to also promote active ageing and provide easy access to basic healthcare and wellness services for our seniors.  It is with that in mind that we set up the CPSSH with the collaboration of Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities and the Chong Pang grassroot organisations. The integrated service centre came about because of the collective effort of government agencies, charity workers, caregivers, elderly, the medical community, grassroots leaders, volunteers.

With the hub, our seniors can enjoy activities such as brain games, IT training, gym exercise, health monitoring checks and periodic health screening. Families and the elderly can use the Call Centre as a listening ear, or to understand and seek assistance in applying for different financial aids and schemes. It is also the first such centre in Singapore to provide free meals to the elderly and needy. The hub is also working with the neighbouring Khoo Teck Puat hospital to train care-givers who can help at the hub, as well as, provide subsidized step-down care referrals to the hospital where necessary. In many ways, it is the community chipping in to help each other.

 At the launch of the Hub, we also have two young volunteers who came in to help with the mural. Gisele is a student from School of the Arts and together with her friend, Kenneth, they kindly put in a few weeks of their time to design and paint the wall mural for the wellness centre. We are recruiting and training volunteers as care-givers who can serve at the wellness centre. We hope more will come forward to serve the Hub. 

At the launch on Sunday, I was heartened by the tremendous turnout, not just the elderly and their families but also well wishers and volunteers who came forward to help. That’s the kind of gracious and selfless community spirit we should all be proud of."

Dear Minister,

1. A recent news report in The Straits Times and on your personal Facebook page caught our attention. It was about a meeting you had with “some activists from Sayoni, a Singapore-based platform for lesbian, bisexual and transsexual Asian women.” This has garnered high-profile publicity for the group. This could be read as high-level endorsement of their agenda. We are deeply concerned. We have been concerned ever since October 2007 when Section 377A of the Penal Code was debated in Parliament.

2. Hence, this letter on behalf of a Team of Senior Pastors representing LoveSingapore. We are an informal relational network of some 100 churches with a membership of at least 40,000 Christians. We love our nation. We share a common passion to be a blessing to Singapore, and to see her flourish and be a positive force of influence in the world from generation to generation. 

3. We humbly request a meeting to dialogue with you, Minister. We want to share our views and position.

4. We sincerely respect our Government for her track record of being pro-Family. We recall the assuring words of Prime Minister Lee in Parliament on 23rd October 2007: “Singapore is basically a conservative society. The family is the basic building block of our society. It has been so and, by policy, we have reinforced this and we want to keep it so. And by “family” in Singapore, we mean one man one woman, marrying, having children and bringing up children within that framework of a stable family unit.”

5. Today, we see a looming threat to this basic building block of our conservative society by homosexual activists seeking to repeal Section 377A of the Penal Code through a court petition challenging its constitutionality.

6.  Thank you for considering our request for a meeting. Please feel free to call me at xxx ….We look forward to hearing from you. 

May God bless you.

Lawrence Khong
Senior Pastor, Faith Community Baptist Church   
Committee Chairman, LoveSingapore Network of Churches
 
 
 
 Dear Mr Shanmugam, 
 
I am writing to you to express my deep concern at an issue that I see will come to affect Singapore in a very negative way - that is, the repeal of 377a. The government has been encouraging Singaporeans to voice out and share their viewpoints and I highly respect leadership who is sincere in wanting to listen to the people's heart. Hence, I wish to voice out my stand that I strongly disapprove of repealing this law and I hope that you would hear me out, and also express my concerns to the relevant parties in affecting change. As the Minister of Law, I hope that you will be able to guard what is healthy and good for Singapore in terms of our laws.
 
I do not believe in repealing 377a because I think that it will bring a shift in the value system in Singapore. Singapore is still by and large a conservative nation and I see this very positively! We have strong beliefs in a healthy and wholesome family. I see this in the government’s support and efforts to promote growing families, for healthy parenting, for children and parents to have better bonds e.g. Dad's for life activities which help fathers to be more involved in their children's lives. All these in totality demonstrate to me that the government wants Singaporeans to highly value the family unit, and in particular, a family that is headed by a father and a mother. I know that the government has not always made decisions that everyone supported or viewed as good, but I continue to support because the government has shown that they want to continue to promote healthy values that would allow our society and the next generation to grow up in a wholesome and healthy way.
 
Making the change to the law does affect the lives of the group that is lobbying for it, but they are not the majority. It may make their lives more convenient and pleasant, but at what cost to our society? I'm not saying that the minority are not important citizens, but decisions that affect society cannot be based upon what pleases or displeases them, but rather what is truly beneficial for our nation, because these laws reflect what our society will live by (adhere and be instructed by) and live towards (values that we aspire towards) as a standard and as a value. 
 
By allowing this law to change, the government is being incongruent with its longstanding message about supporting healthy families, and is inconsistent with its communication to Singaporeans about wanting us to grow our families, what with the low birth rate and all. It will communicate that the government is expressing approval about the homosexual lifestyle and accepting it as a healthy alternative to the currently defined healthy family unit (father, mother, children). The nation is made up of families. Therefore, the state of families will define the state of the nation and how the nation will progress (or regress) because in these family units contain the next generation. I believe that the government should only endorse what would strengthen the traditional family unity (father, mother, children) and really support each member (father and mother) to be strong in parenting and values, so that they will raise children who will continue to be the backbone of this country. The change of this law will eventually attack and break down this family unit as I had defined. 
 
The argument for allowing it so that different people may express freely who they are, is at best an emotional argument. We have many different laws to keep people from freely expressing in a way that is harmful to themselves and others. Take for example, we have laws against people from engaging in sex with those below 16 of age for good reason, and these laws should not be taken away simply because some say that it is simply an expression of their love for each other. If the argument of human rights holds for all cases to allow everything a person desires, then these laws should also be changed! And a homosexual lifestyle, objectively, does put one at a significantly higher risk for sexually transmitted diseases. My thoughts are that just because something is an expression of personal desire for an individual does not mean that it is necessarily beneficial and should be allowed or approved of.
 
The argument that it is alright because it is a personal choice and therefore not a concern of others is also not particularly logical as well. There are many many examples where the law encroaches upon the ""personal freedom"" of an individual, like for example, it is unlawful to attempt/commit suicide. It is illegal to take and possess drugs even if one claims that it is for personal use and not for selling.
 
Laws of a nation may not please everyone in that nation, but that is not its purpose. It is to reflect the collective moral standard of the nation and to set a certain standard that as citizens, we want to live by and live up to. It governs the way citizens are to engage in right living, even though not every person agrees with that particular way. Those who want to attempt suicide, want to legally pursue sexual activity with minors or use drugs certainly would not feel that the law is fair to them and that they don't have the personal freedom that they wish to have, but the law is here for good purpose. People are always inclined to define what's best and right by their own desires, but the law should remain true to a high moral standard and define what is best and right for the society as a whole in moving forward. 

The law will inevitably restraint some for the greater good as it causes people to act or don't act in a way that reflects the values of the nation. People openly litter in many other nations and enjoy their freedom in doing so without much penalty, but it is the strong anti-littering laws of this nation that allow us (and me) to enjoy my freedom of a clean country. By the strong anti-littering laws, I know that Singapore is a place that values personal ownership of the country's well-being and of course, cleanliness.  
 
I am not against homosexuals as people. I know friends and also family who engage in that lifestyle and I love and appreciate them as individuals. I have also seen how their families break up over their lifestyle and over the kind of values that come from this lifestyle. I also know people who are not homosexuals who have engaged in lifestyles who are unlawful (e.g. drug taking). In the same way that I do not approve of the unlawful (and unhealthy) lifestyle of those who are not homosexuals, so do I not approve of the homosexual activities of homosexuals as in 377a. But nonetheless, I will not appreciate them as individuals any less compared to any other person.

Ministry Heng Swee Keat said, ""We are at a critical junction in Singapore’s development – the challenges today and those in the future are real and will affect how Singapore grows as a nation. How can we, as a country realise our vision of Singapore as a 'Home with Hope and Heart'?""
 
The challenges are real and I know there is a pressure to follow after the patterns of other nations that have changed this law. However, these nations have been affected negatively as a result, and changing this law in Singapore at this juncture will affect Singapore’s growth negatively as a nation. I want to realize the vision of Singapore as a Home with Hope and Heart and I believe that it starts off by strengthening the wholesome growth of the family unit and safeguarding that by not allowing anything else to threaten or break it.
 
My group and family would love to meet with you if you are open to talk more on this.
 
Thank you for reading my letter. I hope that you can help to express my concerns and make my voice heard.
 
Yours Sincerely,

This, of course, depends on whether the developer accepts responsibility. If he doesn’t, then we will have to look at legal solutions. I have also asked for a dialogue with BCA, NC members and the developer, in two weeks, to address the concerns faced by the residents. Attached are some photos of the units which I visited and the damages we observed."

Residents had voted for a change of colour scheme. But an energetic and passionate resident asked if we can reconsider because most people didn’t vote (only 10% voted). She wanted to see if she could canvass people to agree to keep to the current colour scheme. Based on residents voting we had awarded the contract, but I agreed to conduct another round of voting to see if more residents express a view. Residents also took the opportunity to share me other municipal issues.

KEYNOTE SPEECH BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND MINISTER FOR LAW K SHANMUGAM AT THE COMMEMORATIVE EVENT FOR THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SINGAPORE COOPERATION PROGRAMME (SCP), THURSDAY, 29 NOVEMBER 2012, AT 6.15 PM, MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Mr S R Nathan
Members of the Diplomatic Corps
Colleagues

Very good evening and welcome. Today, we mark the 20th Anniversary of the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP). Thank you all for joining us to celebrate this special occasion.

OUTLINE

Tonight, I will say a few words about what the SCP does and how it has become a key part of our diplomacy. I will also explain why the SCP is important to Singapore and to friends of Singapore around the world.

WHAT THE SCP IS

We established the SCP in 1992. We had reached a certain level of development and wanted to give something back to the international community.

From the onset, we decided financial aid was not the way we would go or finance infrastructure projects. We understood from our own experience that technical assistance is equally or more effective in creating the right conditions for growth. 

Accordingly, the SCP provides training and experience sharing in areas where Singapore is strong, such as Public Administration, Economic Development, Port Management, Civil Aviation and Water Management.

We train officials from several countries, equip them with skills and knowledge which would help them make a real impact in changing their people’s lives for the better. We also invite foreign officials to visit Singapore to see first-hand our ports, our infrastructure, our gardens, our systems. We share Singapore’s development experiences – our successes as well as mistakes we have made along the way.

The SCP is very well received by Singapore’s friends and partners. Over the past two decades, SCP has trained over 80,000 officials from 170 countries.

PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE SCP

The philosophy behind the SCP is threefold. First, most simply, giving back to the international community is the right thing to do. We believe that all peoples have a right to social and economic development.

Singapore has benefitted in significant ways from technical assistance. When we attained self-rule in 1959, our government turned to the UNDP to develop an economic plan for Singapore. The UNDP led a survey headed by Dutch economist Dr Albert Winsemius. Dr Winsemius later became the Singapore government’s Chief Economic Advisor. Among his early suggestions was the creation of a one-stop investor agency – what we now know as the EDB – the key to our success that has brought several billions every year. He advised that Singapore establish a financial hub.

In our first decades we sought and received technical expertise in almost every sector. We benefitted from the advice of experts:

- from the FAO, the ILO, the ITU, and the WHO 
- from UNESCO, UNIDO, and UNCTAD, 
- and also from the ADB and the World Bank

During the 1980s, as we sought to raise industrial productivity, we received substantial technical assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

Even as Singapore has grown to become an advanced economy, we have not forgotten the help that we had received in the past. We see it as our duty to, in turn, make our contribution to help others in the international community reap the benefits of economic development. So we started the SCP – through which we share our expertise and experiences.

The second reason for the SCP is that it is in our enlightened self-interest.
That is to say helping other countries also helps Singapore. We are a small state and a price-taker in international relations. We cannot prosper in a turbulent and unstable environment. It is in our interest that our region is well-governed, prosperous, equipped to capitalise on globalisation, and attractive to international investment. Likewise, Singapore benefits when countries all around the world are well-equipped to deal with challenges such as financial crises, terrorism and pandemics. These threats are magnified by the inter-connectedness of our world today.

The SCP helps our neighbours, and also benefits Singapore. For example, a good part of the SCP is aimed at strengthening ASEAN. We have focused on subjects such as trade liberalisation and customs management so as to support ASEAN Community Building. Under the Initiative for ASEAN Integration, we have committed S$170 million to narrow the development gap. We have trained more than 50,000 officials from ASEAN. These resources will be spent on enhancing human resource and governance capacities of ASEAN countries. To reach more people, we have established training centres in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.

An ASEAN that is economically integrated, strong, and coherent can better attract investments, create jobs, manage regional challenges, and be a platform to engage larger powers.

The third reason for the SCP is that it helps Singapore build friendships. On a personal level, the SCP alumni I meet overseas - senior officials - have pleasant memories of Singapore and of Singaporeans. Laotian DPM Thoungloun Sisoulith is an SCP alumni. Many have shared with me how SCP training had helped them in their work and opened their minds to new ideas.

On a country-to-country level, many appreciate Singapore’s consistent support in training and technical assistance. For a small country like us, it is important to have this international network of friends. They put us in a better position to defend our interests at the United Nations, and at other international organisations. In such forums, Singapore’s influence depends not only on our abilities and what we bring to the table, but also on the goodwill and trust that other countries have in us.

WAY FORWARD – SMARTER ASSISTANCE

The SCP has been successful because Singapore has been successful. Our experience stands as a powerful example, because we have shown that a small country without natural resources can survive and thrive as long as it has good leadership, political stability, rule of law, well-run and forward-looking institutions, as well as sustained investments in its people. And also pragmatism, a willingness to learn from others, to constantly adapt good practices to local conditions.

We have limited resources and cannot meet all requests for assistance. At the same time, for the reasons I have earlier explained, we want to do more and can do more. We will provide smarter assistance. We will:

- concentrate our efforts in areas where we can make the greatest positive impact;
- use feedback to improve existing programmes and to customise new programmes;
- develop new courses and new capabilities;
- experiment with new tools such as Public-Private Partnerships;
- revitalise our network of partnerships with aid agencies, International Organisations, and other developed countries; and
- work even more closely with our “domestic” agencies in a Whole-Of-Government manner to tap their know-how and expertise to train foreign officials, even as they remain focused on providing services to Singaporeans as their first priority.

We have already started on this. In January this year, to support Myanmar’s efforts in reform, we put together an enhanced technical assistance package tailored to Myanmar’s present needs. In February, I signed an MOU with Hillary Clinton to establish the Singapore-US Third Country Training Programme, primarily in support of ASEAN’s community-building efforts.

We have also developed a new programme on sustainable development and climate change targeted at small island states and the least developed countries.
We are collaborating with the Chinese government on ways to share experiences on social management.

S R NATHAN FELLOWSHIP

Apart from these initiatives, we have also been preparing a new fellowship programme. Under the SCP, we frequently customise visits to Singapore for foreign officials to observe how we deal with issues and challenges of interest to them. In the process, they get to know us better, and understand us better.

Tonight, it is my pleasure to announce that MFA will be launching a new high-level Fellowship. This will help us to establish deeper links with leaders and opinion-shapers such as cabinet ministers, parliamentarians, mayors, journalists and academics from around the world. We will invite them to Singapore to exchange ideas, experiences and perspectives on current and long-term challenges.

We are naming this new high-level Fellowship the “S R Nathan Fellowship” to honour former President Nathan’s tremendous contributions to Singapore and to Singapore's foreign policy. Mr Nathan has helped Singapore make many friends during his long tenure with MFA and during his 2-term presidency. There is no better person whose achievements and spirit we would like to associate with this new and prestigious Fellowship.

We hope that this Fellowship will expand Singapore’s network of friends and advocates around the world.

Once again, I would like to thank Mr Nathan for joining us this evening,
for his many years of public service, and for having kindly consented to lend his name to this Fellowship.

Conclusion

Before I conclude, I wish to pay tribute to the many officers in the background who play important roles in the success of the SCP.

They include:

- Our partners from the various Singapore agencies and universities who have not only shared their professional expertise but have also taken time to tell SCP participants more about Singapore and our way of life;

- Our team of liaison officers who are the first and last people SCP participants see in Singapore. Thank you for making SCP participants feel at home; and

- Last but not least, the past and current staff in MFA’s Technical Cooperation Directorate. They have toiled behind the scenes to take care of logistical arrangements, to ensure the quality of content and curriculum, and to satisfy themselves that SCP participants are well looked after during their stay in Singapore.

All of you can be proud of what the SCP has achieved.

More and more people are going for ART. The issue of legal parenthood is particularly acute in cases of ART mix-ups. Our paramount aim is to protect the best interests of the child, and to ensure no child is left parentless. To achieve this, MinLaw proposes that the gestational mother and her husband who consented to the ART treatment be treated as the legal parents of the child. 

MinLaw welcomes views on what the best approach should be to determine the legal parentage of children conceived through ART.

The Taoist festival is also, in a way, a multi-racial, multi-religious affair. The nine-day festival has become very much a part of the Chong Pang culture and heritage.
 
For me, the experience of going through the colourful rituals and 
procession is electric, and moving. The organisers made  
generous efforts to extend their celebrations to others in the community, including hosting charity
dinners and free goodie bags for the elderly, visiting Indian temples and entertaining residents with free concerts.
 
I am particularly thankful that the organisers of the Kew Ong Ya Festival - which has a history dating back over 2,000 years - allow me to participate in their major ceremonies and rituals every year.

The organising committee had put up  a meaningful event which comprised a series of wellness programmes. Many agencies and community partners such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Agency of Integrated Care, Realm of Tranquility, Clarity Singapore and Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society were also involved in the event.

While I had fun attending the activities, I also delivered some important messages to the participants. I believe promoting active ageing in the community is a key priority for Singapore as our population ages. We want to encourage our senior citizens to embrace active ageing and keep themselves physically, mentally and socially engaged.

Later speaking to the media, I made the point that we need to seriously think ahead on the challenges that we will soon confront on the issue of ageing as our economy enters a slower growth phase. We need to honestly and effectively communicate these issues to our population. There are implications in terms of healthcare costs and the burden on our entire support system.

According to official projections, we may only have two working people supporting a retired person by 2030, down from eight to one today. With that scenario, we need to ensure that our senior citizens remain healthy, have good diets, exercise and have positive emotional well-being. We need to provide the right outreach, the education, the medical care and the space as well as organise the activities for them. We all have to play our part in meeting these enormous challenges."

Some of them were at the dinner - players like Tan Lian Ann, Leslie Leow, Chan Peng Kong and several others. The story of chess in Spore is an interesting one - during the teen years, our players play very well, and some perform very credibly in international tournaments. For example, i was told - Tan Lian Ann did extremely well in 1968, when he beat a world top ten GM ( I havent verified this myself, but this is what I was told). He also did well in other international tournaments. But then our players dont go on to become world class GMs - because of the need to put studies and career first, and chess is not supported in Spore the way it is in some ( mostly ex communist) countries. Pity , as I think with some changes, ( we dont have to, and cant go as far as those countries), we can produce some truly outstanding players."

In New York, Sandy has caused severe floods in large parts of the city, bringing public transport to a halt. It has even interrupted the presidential campaign! 

Let's hope our friends and loved ones in the US, including Singaporeans living there, are safe and able to stay clear of danger. Our hearts go out to the Americans and hope they are able to meet this natural disaster with minimum damage."
203314719715066_451850948194774,"Last weekend was yet another packed and enjoyable one. And meaningful one too.  

I was particularly heartened by the good work by so many people in the community straddling across government agencies, grassroot organisations, NGOs, healthcare institutions, volunteers and residents of Chong Pang coming together to help one another. 

First, I joined about a thousand residents in Chong Pang for our morning brisk-walking exercise. This is an event held every last Sunday of the month. Not only does it promote a healthy lifestyle, the mass exercise serves as a good platform to bring residents together for some fun and bonding.  

Then we had the “Think Well, Live Well’’ outreach event, which was organised by Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society. THKM and my grassroots, together with govt agencies, are going to launch a new initiative in Chong Pang -  the Chong Pang Social Service Hub, that will provide a comprehensive range of elderly care and social services to our community in Chong Pang. 

In its proposed permanent facility, the hub plans to offer a Wellness Centre with additional services such as drop-in centre, wellness programmes, free lunches for needy residents, cybercafé, caregiver training and even a call centre to connect elderly in need of help or company. It also offers nursing staff in collaboration with the Khoo Teck Puat hospital. Some of the activities will give our elderly a positive sense of accomplishment as they step forward to help others.   Residents and volunteers have also been supportive in the project. 

As I said on Sunday, we need to adapt pragmatically to an aging population. Inevitably, the need for social and healthcare services will increase. We must ensure that these services remain accessible and affordable and of good quality. With adequate supporting structure and the blessing of our caring residents, our population can age gracefully. And happily."
203314719715066_450515138328355,"I spent Wednesday and Thursday in Indonesia, and arrived back in Singapore late last night.  My first meeting was with Indonesian FM, Marty Natalagewa in Yogyakarta. 

Getting to Yogya from Singapore requires us to take the 7.40 am flight to Jakarta and then catch a connecting flight - was quite tiring, as the previous night we also had the celebration for the Nine Emperors, with a sending off at the seaside, and finished past midnight. A direct flight to Yogyakarta would have been easier. I believe there will be  strong demand if there was a direct flight.

I had a good series of meetings with Pak Marty.  We first had a privatefour-eye meeting. Then we had a working lunch with our respective delegations.  We took the opportunity to have in depth discussions on bilateral relations, and on the areas in which we could deepen our cooperation.  There is tremendous potential in tourism, in trade and investment, in air transport.  Our relationship with Indonesia is multifaceted, strong, and very very substantive.  It is also mutually beneficial - this is the basis of our cooperation. 

On Thursday, I travelled to Jakarta, where I called on President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. I had a private meeting with the President and Pak Marty.  In the afternoon we met GOLKAR Chairman Abulrizal Bakrie, GERINDRA Patron Prabowo Subianto.  We caught the evening flight back to Singapore, and arrived in Changi close to midnight.

Singapore's relationship with Indonesia is very important.  Our mutual ties are deep - in trade, in investment, in people-to-people exchanges, and in many other areas.  Pak Marty and I meet regularly, not only in Singapore and in Indonesia, but also on the sidelines of various international fora.  For example, we met in New York during the recent General Assembly in September."

MND and Chong Pang support this project. The project hopes to carry out a trial on responsible cat ownership at 123 HDB blocks in Chong Pang. Residents in the selected Chong Pang blocks will be allowed to own one pet cat per flat. They can adopt a cat from the CWS, SPCA or existing community cats / strays that residents have been taking care of.

In this project, pet owners will have to play their part by being good neighbours and ensuring their pets do not create nuisances to their neighbours, given our high-density living environment. There is a code which they have to sign up to. Before launching this project, we did a survey and I was heartened to know that 97% of Chong Pang residents are supportive of co-existing with community cats if the cats are sterilized and responsibly managed.

I believe how we treat the issue of animal welfare will be reflective of how compassionate a society we are.

This year’s recipient of the award Dr Kumaran Rasappan is a true inspiration. A medical doctor at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), Dr Kumaran is also best remembered as the person who scaled Mount Everest and raised funds for Tan Tock Seng Hospital Community Charity Fund. 

Despite his tight work commitment, Dr Kumaran, only 28, has managed to spend considerable time giving motivational talks at the prison school to help inmates overcome their personal problems and improve their studies. He has also given such talks to primary, secondary and JC students and at SINDA's step tuition centres where students from low income families attend classes.

I was most impressed with Dr Kumaran’s humility and generosity. At the ceremony, Dr Kumaran nominated the TTSH Community Charity Fund as the beneficiary to receive the $10,000 which is attached to the award. This, he said, was part of his climbing and post-climbing fund raising effort called 'No Mountain Too High', which is for the needy patients of TTSH. 

Into its second year, the tabla! Community Champion Award is given to a person from our Indian community with a distinguished record of working with the less fortunate in Singapore - an unsung hero who selflessly devotes time and effort in addition to his or her job. I hope Dr Kumaran’s mountaineering feat and selfless contribution to society will serve as a source of inspiration to other young Singaporeans to come forward and help the less fortunate in our community. - Pictures used with permission from Tamil Murasu"
203314719715066_447747251938477,"We passed some changes to the Civil Law Act early this week. This will allow more assets of the deceased to be claimed by those who have equitable and moral claims to them.

my paper

Headline: More assets of dead can be claimed

Changes were made to the Civil Law Act passed in Parliament yesterday.

Joy Fang

Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that ""it is only fair that such property can go to someone with an equitable or moral claim.""

SINGAPORE - More assets, belonging to those who die without any legal heirs or next of kin, may soon be given to those who have a ""moral claim"" to the deceased's property.

This was made possible with changes to the Civil Law Act passed in Parliament yesterday.

The amendments mean that non-estate properties - such as Central Provident Fund savings where no nomination has been made, Edusave and Post- Secondary Education Fund monies, and monies placed in a Child Development Account - may be distributed.

Currently, the Law Minister has the discretion to transfer only assets of the deceased's estate, which refers to all of the property owned by the deceased.

Moral claimants are people whom the deceased may have been reasonably expected to leave his or her assets to because of a close relationship, or because they have cared extensively for them.

Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that ""it is only fair that such property can go to someone with an equitable or moral claim, rather than the Government"".

The changes do not affect the disposal of property according to Muslim law, which continues to fall under the Administration of Muslim Law Act.

The implementation date of the changes will be announced at a later time.

Nominated Member of Parliament Ramasamy Dhinakaran praised the amendments as being ""timely"" in the face of declining birth rates, as that would mean a future in which ""many may grow old without next of kin or clear heirs to their properties"".

However, he was worried about the authenticity of some claims that could emerge, and suggested imposing penalties to deter wrongful claims.

In response, Mr Shanmugam said there will be safeguards against false claims.

Any claim will be processed only six months after a person's death, to allow time for the entitled next of kin to step forward.

While a court order is not needed, claimants will be required to submit supporting documents, such as receipts of hospital or funeral expenses, as well as a statutory declaration or affidavit which must state the basis of the claim, Mr Shanmugam noted.

""Making a false statutory declaration or filing a false affidavit are serious offences. I think these are safeguards which will minimise the likelihood of false claims being made,"" he said.

Marine Parade GRC MP Fatimah Lateef asked for more details on the methods of sale of the deceased's estate property and how the payment will be made.

Mr Shanmugam clarified that the minister's principal role is to decide who has a moral or equitable claim.

Administration of the estate is usually done by the claimant or other private parties, and it is for the administrator to decide on matters such as whether to sell the estate property, when to do so and how, as well as the manner in which it is distributed, he said."

203314719715066_446283688751500,"I had visited Canberra in early September together with Minister Lim Hng Kiang and Minister Ng Eng Hen to attend the 7th meeting of the Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Committee, or SAJMC.  This is a regular meeting between the Singaporean and Australian Ministers in charge of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence.  It is an important platform that allows high-level discussions of the key of our relations with Australia, as well as broader strategic issues in the region.  From the Australian side, we were joined this year by Minister for Foreign Affairs Bob Carr, Minister for Trade and Competitiveness Craig Emerson and Minister for Defence Stephen Smith.
 
I had a number of meetings.  First I had a private meeting with Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr. Then we had a ""closed"" session with only the six ministers present.  We had excellent, frank discussions, running well past the time that had been allocated.  We then had an ""open"" session with officials from both sides present.  Finally, we had a joint press conference, with each minister taking his turn to speak. 
 
It is important for Singapore to maintain our relations with Australia.  Our two countries have strong ties.  Two-way trade and investment are in the tens of billions.  Many Singaporeans study, work and live in Australia.  A good number of our national servicemen have gone there for training exercises.  At many levels, our officials maintain strong working relationships with their Australian counterparts.
 
Equally important is the common strategic vision that Singapore and Australia share on issues of mutual concern.  Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr wrote in an article he wrote in the Australian Financial Review on 11 October:
 
"" In talks with Singaporean Foreign Minister Shanmugam last month, I was struck by our common outlook on geopolitics. Our talks went into overtime because we had much to discuss. Take for example the South China Sea, where our viewpoints are virtually identical. Prime Minister Lee explained in his speech to the Central Party School in September that Singapore is “not a claimant country, takes no sides in any of the territorial disputes nor can we judge the merits of the various claims. However, Singapore does have certain critical interests at stake”. Australia and Singapore want to see free navigation, a de-escalation of tensions and a settlement based on international law including, but not limited to, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.""
 
PM, who visited Australia last week, described Singapore and Australia as ""kindred souls"".  PM Julia Gillard said that she ""cannot not imagine an Australia which does not call Singapore a friend, nor a prime minister of Singapore who did not feel welcome in our capital.""
 
The strength and value of a platform such as the Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Committee lies in such goodwill and common understanding."

We had artists, filmmakers, and street dancers representing the creative community. We had youth volunteers from various causes, ranging from youth empowerment, animal rights, environmental movements and VWOs.  We also had youth activists from various religious and ethnic groups.     They were all part of organisations which I had engaged previously.   This forum allowed me to catch up with some of the young people to take our conversations further.  Singapore's future belongs to our young and it is important they stay engaged in the governance process. Our next 20 years would be very different from the last.  Our young people have to decide for themselves, on a fresh canvass, what future they want to paint for Singapore.    At the forum, they were vocal, uninhibited, and asked interesting questions. We also spent many hours, talking about diverse topics including meritocracy, foreign talent, LGBT issues, housing, ISA and taxes. I did my best to absorb their perspectives, to explain the policy rationales, as well as the trade-offs on the issues discussed.

Her comments and conduct are shameful and completely unacceptable. This confirms what I had long suspected and said : there are deep fault lines in our society, based on race/religion. The emergence of the Internet and social media such as blogging and facebook frees some people to say what is really in their hearts. Her comments reflect a deep seated racist attitude coupled with contempt for those who are less well off, or who wish to spend less.  I had said, in 2002, in Parliament, that we should look deep into our hearts and ask what the attitudes of non Malays are towards our Malay brothers and sisters. We will be a truly civilised society only when we deep in our hearts accept everyone as equal. I enclose a copy of the speech. I am glad that NTUC took swift action to terminate her employment. This should send a message that such conduct will not be tolerated.
 
Excerpt from my speech in 2002. - 
""I think, it was ingrained in the psyche of many, though not all, non-Muslim Singaporeans that somehow our Muslim Singaporeans were less competitive, and less able. These feelings and reactions were reinforced by the relative insularity of the lives which many Singaporeans lead. Those who were involved  in community work and had to reach across racial lines could overcome such reactions. But not many had such opportunities. Our Muslim Singaporeans, of course, picked up on those feelings. And our Muslim Singapore society stood feeling that it was not adequately respected by sections of Singaporean society. I would add that these are only my personal views, and others may well disagree. We cannot prove or disprove these things. We can only look straight into our hearts and minds.''"
203314719715066_442458985800637,"Today I visited Mr Tan Cheng Chu, the gentleman whose plight has been circulating around the Internet on a video - he has a terminal illness and his main companions are his two dogs. Ms Beulah from SOSD ( Save Our Street Dogs) as well Louis Ng, from Acres, were also there.   The problem is that a neighbour has been complaining to the HDB about the dogs. As a result of the complaints, HDB was left with no choice but to enforce the rules - which meant Mr Tan has been asked to give up one of his two dogs, since the HDB rules allow only one dog to be kept in a HDB flat.   Listening to Mr Tan, and playing with his dogs, one thought kept going through my mind again and again  - what sort of person will complain about Mr Tan keeping the dogs in such a situation ? The dogs were friendly, adorable, and obedient. The neighbour apparently could not stand the sound of scratching and the dogs playing with a ball.   A bit of compassion and sympathy will go a long way but some amongst us can only think of ourselves, and can't even consider the wishes of Mr Tan, who is very ill.   I told Mr Tan that I will speak with his MP, Dr Maliki Osman, so that Dr Maliki can take up the matter with HDB and the complainant. HDB is bound by its rules, though, given the circumstances, HDB has not enforced the rules for more than a year, despite the  consistent complaints. HDB is, of course, in a very difficult position. I have spoken with Dr Maliki and asked him if Dr Maliki can approach the complainant and mediate, to see if the complainant can withdraw his objections. SOSD is willing to help mediate in the dispute as well. Hopefully we will get a sensible outcome.   This is a situation which many MPs come across frequently. There are many rules on how various activities have to be conducted. But such rules cannot foresee every situation. And, depending on the situation, sometimes there has to be discretion exercised on how the rules should actually be applied. But frequently we will get one or two residents who will insist that the rules be enforced strictly, though the vast majority are ok with the situation. Often the complainers will be behaving unreasonably - but strictly speaking , they will  be entitled to complain, and they will do so, repeatedly.

""Came across this book review in the Weekend Wall Street Journal, by Sadanand Dhume, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Entitled “Sins of Their Founders”, the piece reviews a book on the civil war in Sri Lanka. The civil war started in 1983, but as Dhume pointed out its roots go back to the country’s independence in 1948. Instead of embracing an inclusive view of citizenship, Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) marginalised the Tamil minority. The Tamil revolt was led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, a brutal guerrilla leader. The bloody conflict killed tens of thousands, and set the country back many years. Now that it is over, I hope Sri Lanka can enjoy lasting peace and stability.

Dhume noted that Singapore took a different path, with a different result. We are fortunate that right from the birth of our nation, our founders upheld multi-racialism and equal opportunity as the fundamental basis for our society. Thus we have maintained harmony between the different races and religions all these years. But we must never take this harmony as given, and must continue to work hard together to uphold and strengthen it.'' – LHL

Straits Times: S'pore, China clearer on each other's position
 
Shanmugam points to deep, frank talks
 
By Goh Sui Noi Senior Writer
 
SINGAPORE and China have had deep and frank talks on the South China Sea territorial disputes and now better understand each other's position, Foreign Minister K. Shanmugam said yesterday.
 
He noted that during Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's visit to China last week, Mr Lee had long discussions with Chinese leaders. These were followed by bilateral consultations between Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Fu Ying and Mr Shanmugam in Singapore on Saturday.
 
""I think the visit, as well as the bilateral consultations, has allowed us to get a better perspective on China's position and for China to get a better perspective on our position,"" he said in an interview with local media.
 
He said that Singapore has not taken sides in the overlapping claims that China has with four Asean states, namely, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, over waters rich in fishing and energy resources.
 
""We have always said the claims are for the claimant states to settle, Asean should be neutral, and certainly Singapore has always been and continues to be neutral on the claims,"" he said.
 
Asean's role, he said, was in ""the broader setting of a framework which would allow for a peaceful resolution of these claims"". He gave by way of example Asean having a role in formulating the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea - to prevent escalation of disputes in the waters.
 
Ms Fu, in her interview with Singapore media, said Asean's role was in ensuring peace and stability in the region and that it should stay neutral.
 
Singapore and China's discussions have taken place as tension in the region escalated in recent months, including a naval stand- off between China and the Philippines.
 
Temperatures have also risen further north between China and Japan over the disputed Diaoyu islands - Senkaku to the Japanese - with the Chinese angry over Tokyo's decision to buy the islands from their private owners.
 
Mr Shanmugam said yesterday while Singapore was not a claimant state in the South China Sea, ""we have every interest in wanting the disputes to be resolved in as peaceful a way as possible"".
 
He noted that China recognises that peace and stability are essential for it to continue to develop, so it wants these as much as anyone else. China and Singapore have agreed to work closely on these matters, he said. - Reproduced with permission from The Straits Times.
 


Business Times : Neutrality urged in South China Sea row
Shanmugam outlines Asean's role on the issue
 
SINGAPORE and Asean should be neutral when it comes to seeking a resolution between claimants in the South China Sea dispute, said Foreign Affairs Minister K Shanmugam yesterday.
 
Outlining Asean's role on the issue, Mr Shanmugam said this did not entail all 10 member states getting directly involved in the resolution process.
""Singapore has always taken the position and that goes for Asean speaking with one voice, that as far as the claims are concerned, they ought to be resolved amongst and between the claimant states,"" he said.
 
Instead, he said Asean can construct a framework that will allow for a peaceful settlement of the claims.
 
""Asean's role, as Singapore has articulated and others have articulated, is not to deal with the claims themselves but in the broader setting up of the framework which would allow for a peaceful resolution of these claims. For example, Asean had a role in formulating the Declaration of Conduct (DOC). (As for) the implementation guidelines on the DOC and likewise the Code of Conduct that we hope will be negotiated, Asean will have a role (to play in this). So that is the context that we have said Asean has a role, not in the specific delineation or settlement of the claims between the claimant states.""
Mr Shanmugam's remarks come amid media reports suggesting that Singapore's view was that the non-claimant states in Asean should play a more direct role in the resolution.
 
""We have always been clear that Asean's role, Asean as a whole, the 10 states' role, is in dealing with the framework. And that is the principle that has been accepted because Asean is a party to the DOC. Asean came out with the implementation guidelines. So that's really a non-contentious principle,"" he said.
 
Media reports had quoted China's Vice-Foreign Affairs Minister Fu Ying as saying that Asean should not have a role in negotiating on behalf of its members who were claimant states. This may have given rise to the impression that both China and Singapore had differing views on whether Asean should have a role, when this was actually not the case.
 
""We had several long and frank discussions in China during PM's visit. That was followed by bilateral consultations where the Vice-Minister had discussions with me as well as both my Permanent Secretaries and I think that the visit as well as the bilateral consultations has allowed us to get a better perspective on China's position and for China to get a better perspective on our position.""
 
Mr Shanmugam added: ""Madam Fu Ying made the same point. In fact, she made two points. One, that Prime Minister Lee had very deep and frank discussions with the Chinese leaders and likewise, during the bilaterals, she had very deep and frank discussions with me as well as my Permanent Secretaries. Those are her words, and I echo them completely. She also said, and I think this is very important, that this has given China a better perspective on Singapore's position. Likewise, it has also given us a better perspective on China's position."" - Reproduced with permission from The Business Times.
 
 
南中国海主权问题 亚细安不会介入
尚穆根：应由个别声索国自行磋商
（2012-09-12）

　　近日南中国海主权争议被媒体广泛报道，一些报道让人觉得新加坡和中国在南中国海议题上有相当大的意见分歧。但尚穆根指出，事实并非如此。
郑景祥　报道

　　南中国海主权争议应该由个别声索国自行磋商，亚细安不会介入，也不会支持任何一方，亚细安所扮演的角色就是制定一个能够协助南中国海争议和平解决的框架，减低情况失控的风险。
　　外交部长兼律政部长尚穆根昨天在外交部和记者会面，阐述我国的上述立场。
　　近日南中国海主权争议被媒体广泛报道，一些报道让人觉得新加坡和中国在南中国海议题上有相当大的意见分歧。但尚穆根指出，事实并非如此。
　　他说：“李显龙总理在中国访问的时候，与中国领导有好几场深入和坦率的讨论。随后举行的新中两国外交部双边磋商，中国外交部副部长傅莹和我以及两位常任秘书也交换了意见。这次总理访问和双边磋商让我们更了解中国的立场，另一方面也让中国更清楚我国的立场。”
　　当记者追问磋商内容的时候，尚穆根透露确实有一些实质的结果，但并不适宜公开讨论这些细节。
　　事实上，傅莹在接受《联合早报》访问的时候，也有类似的回应。她说：“这些谈话的深度和坦诚给我留下了深刻印象。不难看出，我们两国在当前很多重大议题上有着共同的诉求和共识。”
尚穆根表示，亚细安里面除了部分声索国，也有非声索国。所以亚细安主张制定一个框架，让声索过程在和平的情况下进行。就像2002年签署的《南中国海各方行为宣言》那样，亚细安希望设立一个框架让各国遵守，因此亚细安的作用从来不是确切地介入解决声索国的争议。尚穆根所谓的框架就是指“南中国海行为准则”。
　　他说：“之前的《南中国海各方行为宣言》设定了大原则让各国遵守。南中国海行为准则尝试引入更多较深入的细节，例如声索各方应该以什么方式接触，以及引发纠纷时应该怎么应对等。”
　　目前，南中国海行为准则的协商还没有正式启动。尚穆根说，亚细安的立场是要尽快展开行为准则的协商。他透露，我国已经向中方官员传达了这个看法。他认为中国有在听，而我国也会继续努力。
　　“中国虽然也同意制定南中国海行为准则，但是今年7月亚细安外长会议的时候，中国认为时机还不成熟。我们已经请它重新考虑，因为这是至关重要的。”
　　尚穆根认为主权争议一般不容易解决，声索过程旷日费时，这段期间声索国彼此要怎么对待是行为准则尝试应对的问题。
　　但中国认为一些亚细安国家之前违背了《宣言》的精神，要怎么让它相信南中国海行为准则？
　　尚穆根说：“我们向中国表达了立场。虽然一些事件的发生，中国和其他声索国各有自己的看法，但重要的是接下来要怎么应对。我们向中国及其他国家表明，行为准则是对大家都有利的，因为它将说明了哪些行为是可以被接受，哪些是不被允许的。”
　　尚穆根认为，希望和平解决南中国海的争议，不只是亚细安的意愿，也是中国的意愿。因为中国知道和平稳定对它的持续发展是很重要的。

203314719715066_433856829994186,"Came back to singapore on Friday night from China, where I had accompanied  PM. Went to Canberra on Sunday for a joint meeting of ministers. Came back late last night. Our relationship with Australia is very good. The meeting between the 6 Ministers went very well.  Canberra is a beautiful city and the weather was very good. But unfortunately we only stayed for about 6 hours yesterday morning, attending the meetings and then left for Singapore.
 
This afternoon I met Mr James Leach, Chairman of the US National Endowment for the Humanities.  We spoke about the cultural diplomacy, about how competition in this area would be a good thing for everyone.  Leach is visiting under the auspices of the Singapore International Foundation."
203314719715066_432308510149018,"In Chengdu, we visited the Sichuan Singapore Hi Tech Innovation Park. Our businesses are heavily invested in Chengdu as well as in the Park. We visited together with local senior officials. This was important gesture for our businesses.We also had lunch with senior Chinese business men who have either invested in Singapore or are thinking of investing in Spore. Many of them are in high tech industries, and are thinking of making Spore their business hub for this region. If they do invest it will mean more jobs ( good jobs) for Sporeans and helps Spore. One of them asked me in worried tones about xenophobia in Spore. He wanted to know if business climate in Spore was still conducive for investment. It is clear that a fair number of business people, who could set up businesses in Spore, are beginning to think along these lines."
203314719715066_431715723541630,"I left for China, with PM, on Sunday, 2 Sep.   We went to Chengdu first. We visited Yingxiu town, which is near the place which was the epi centre of the May 2008 earthquake which led to devastating losses. At that time Sporeans gave very generously for the relief efforts. We went to look at the reconstruction. It was a way of showing our solidarity with the people of China, for what they went through.I was very moved by the account given by one little girl. As she recounted what happened, she cried. She was out in the playing field and heard a huge noise. She wanted to run back to the school, but fortunately a teacher who was running out told her and other children to stay out. The school building collapsed. One of her friends fell as the children were all running out, and was trampled to death. She cried when she recalled that. The school has been rebuilt with funds from Spore. The photos show one school which has been preserved in its destroyed state ( with a clock showing the time of the earthquake - 2.28 ; Yingxiu town before the earthquake and after it has now been reconstructed.  While the disaster was devastating, it was astonishing to see how quickly the reconstruction has been done. It shows the spirit, the will and the capabilities of the people of China and its government ."

203314719715066_429726000407269,"During my block visit this week, and in my MPS this week, a common, recurrent issue was raised by 2 residents.  What is done in one HDB flat impacts on other flats  -   cooking , noise, kids playing and so on. This week one lady raised the issue of singing/music from her neighbour's flat - the singing and drumming kept her awake. These sorts of issues have been around for a long time, though my sense is also that people are less willing to put up with such conduct now, compared with some years ago.At present there is no satisfactory legal solution to deal with these problems. Most of such conduct is social nuisance, but not  criminal, and there is not much the police can do. So residents who call the police end up feeling frustrated - because the police can only take action if it is criminal conduct. The second approach is for the residents to go to the civil courts - which is not really feasible either. We need to consider new ways of dealing with  conduct which is social nuisance - because the tolerance ofr such conduct is much less now. We probably need a legal framework, which sets out what we should avoid doing, when we live close to each other  - because it unreasonably impacts on our neighbours - we need to develop new norms. The key is of course to identify what is unreasonable, because   complainants can also be unreasonable. And there should be sanctions for such conduct which are easy to enforce."

203314719715066_429086667137869,"The recent case where a contractor dumped his foreign worker by the roadside and left him to die was shocking. The FW needed treatment . He was unconscious. His body was dropped off in Changi by the contractor and another person.the contractor says that the FW was illegal and didn't want to be brought to hospital after suffering a work injury. To me the question is : how should we treat fellow human beings - do we care for their lives? The conduct here was contrary to basic notions of decency,apart from being criminal. It shows a callous disregard for others."
203314719715066_429031433810059,"I go to a Old Town coffeeshop in Bt Timah,  on  weekends,  to have a coffee for an hour or so, with my wife.  I put aside all thought of my work. This hour with my wife allows me to feel re charged, refreshed. A couple of weekends ago, when we were having our weekly 'date', a group of children came to take a photo with us. They were all cousins. It was very nice to see them spending time with each other on a weekend. They were full of enthusisasm and energy, as kids usually are. It was fun."
203314719715066_429232003781604,"PM made a truly inspiring speech last night. A speech full of passion, and foresight. Among the key areas that PM touched on are :
 
1. PreSchool - this area needs more government support and it is good that it is going to get more attention. I ma a passionate beliver in providing our young children with the best possible PreSchool education;
 
2. HDB flats for singles - PM seems to be signalling that there can be some movement on this;
 
3. more support for parents to have children, including possibly paternity leave ;
 
4. more university places for Singaporeans - places to increase by 3000 per year whichmeans 40% of each cohort can go to Universities;
 
5. the need for us to recognise that some things being said, against foreigners,  online, anonymously, are repulsive and xenophobic ,and does not really represent the best spirit of Spore. The majority of Sporeans are tolerant, decent  and open hearted. The small minority ,which is highly negative, and hiding behind anonymity, and spewing vitriol, should not be allowed to set the tone for the debate."
203314719715066_428335813879621,"Many friends have asked about Zorro, the puppy that we adopted earlier this year.  Zorro became well known because ST carried the news! 

Zorro has been with us for about 5 months now.  He is 8 months old now and has had all his immunization shots, sterilization was completed 6 weeks ago, and his vet says he is a very healthy dog with a very healthy appetite (7.5 cups of food a day!!).  Personality-wise, he is an extremely sweet, energetic, intelligent and playful puppy.  We enjoy him very much.   

Due to his early puppyhood experiences – i.e. witness to the traumatic ill-treatment and abuse of his siblings and possibly himself, separated from his mother, needing to scavenge for food, etc. – he seems to be a very fearful and uncertain little puppy that startles easily at the slightest of sounds like soft beeping noises, the rustle of leaves, abandons his food when he hears things or sees strangers, etc.   

It is a defensive sort of behaviour rather than an offensive aggressive behaviour.  He anticipates trouble so in a defensive manoeuvre he starts growling, barking and gestures to bite humans and dogs....but never bites despite the numerous opportunities to do so.  

So, we checked with a couple of dog behaviour experts and the recommendation was that Zorro undergo an intensive behaviour training program that includes lots of exposure to and socialization with other dogs, various humans handling him on a daily basis so as to help him learn and understand from experience people and dogs don’t mean any harm and there is nothing to fear.  Hopefully this will serve as a corrective experience for him and will help him feel less anxious and defensive.  So he is under the care of Cohen at Mutts N Mittens farm for 6 weeks.  We recently paid him a visit.  Photos are attached.   

If you go through the photos, you will see a remarkable similarity to human behaviour, particularly how he responded to Twiggy, a sleek and pretty female in Cohen’s care!"

203314719715066_427649010614968,"Thanks to everyone for your comments and emails, in response to my post on driving habits in Spore. The FB post received over 360 comments. Obviously touched some raw nerves. Some have asked what car was my wife driving, and have made some suggestions along the lines of women drivers not being very good. She was driving a VW Touran  - a practical car , that transports our family and dogs - a car which no one on the road will give a second look at, except that occassionally it gets mistaken for a taxi, and ppl try and hail it down. On that day ( when I wrote about our experiences) she was either on the slow lane or the middle lane, as far as I can recall. She doesn’t usually get onto the fast lane. For those who believe that female drivers are not very good - it is time you stopped visiting this FB. My wife has been driving for 23 yrs, and has never gotten a ticket, and is a very careful, steady driver.
People have also asked me about my driving experiences. So here goes : I have driven for over 20 yrs. For many years, I used to live in Changi. I think my home was about 20+ km away from my office and 20+ km away from my constituency. I used to drive about 30,000 km per annum. My driving was almost exclusively on expressways - used the ECP to get to office and the TPE to get to my constituency. I wouldn’t consider myself a perfect or even a good driver, in terms of technical skills. But I put a premium on being courteous - to let pedestrians and other vehicles pass, to let others filter, acknowledge when others give way, and so on.
 
Traffic and accidents have been on my mind in the last 2 weeks, more than usually so. On 10 Aug ,I posted about the freak accident that took place in Chong Pang ( where a car reversed onto the walkway, went along for several metres and injured several people, some seriously) and the vicitms whom I visited in hospital.
 
Last Friday I visited another old lady in KTP, vicitm of another accident in my area. On the day of the accident, as per her usual routine, she went for an early morning walk at about 6 am. She crossed the road at a road crossing, and according to her sons the green man was in her favour. After she had crossed half the road, a car hit into her and apparently had dragged her a bit. She is a small person, in her 70s, and her son wrote to me about the accident and his mother's condition. The way the email was written, describing her condition in the hospital made me fear the worst. I visited her on last Friday. She had had several procedures done to her, and was cheerful , full of vitality, despite her injuries. I was happy to see her in such good spirit. She was still stitched up everywhere.
 
Two days ago I met a lady Ambassador ( from another country) at a function. She talked about driving in spore. She comes from a country where ppl are quite aggressive. She said that in her country, the men will shout at her , on the roads, and tell her that she should be in the kitchen and not behind the wheels. She said that that does not happen in Spore. But the driving here , according to her, was  worse. She added that it was lucky the other drivers could not hear what she usually  says about their driving, when incidents happen - because her windows were  up (!).
 
I have had many others ( both Singaporeans and non singaporeans) say similar things to me - both in person and by email, and of course through their comments on FB.
 
My wife and I  usually go for a weekend coffee at Chun Tin Road. We have been regularly shocked  by the fairly brazen conduct of some  drivers- cars turning into a one way street ( against the flow of traffic) from the main road, in order to make a 3 point turn and then reversing onto the main street, ( and it is a fairly busy street), cars turning from a T junction, into a main street,  without giving allowance or way to cars on either side on the main street and so on. When we were able to, we have given the vehicle numbers to TP.
Over the years, we seem to have become less courteous, and it does say something about ourselves. How well we treat others , ( including other living things),  defines us, as a society. My interest in various groups, including animal welfare groups, stems from this basic belief.
 
Time we considered seriously , what to do about our driving habits ?"
203314719715066_427327330647136,"I have received several comments, questions, raised through emails as well as posts on my 2 posts on racial issues. Will try and deal with the questions that have been raised.  A number of people have asked why I did the post, what does it say about Spore , are Indians being targeted and so on.  I made the posting to make the point that  these sentiments exist and how they sometimes get expressed. The resulting (overwhelming)  support for multi racialism, and against prejudice, has in my view been helpful  - it reiterates our common value that such prejudicial views are not accpetable. That helps strengthen  norms, values, and makes us an even stronger multi racial society . Others who want to say such things, will be a little bit more constrained. There are 2 more points I want to make. First- for those who think these comments are directed at only the Indians or that  Indians are themselves free of prejudice -  pls read the prejudicial comments left on my FB by some ( who appear to be Indians) about non Indians - comments which should never have been made. I believe that there are ppl  , ( a small number) within all our racial groups, who hold prejudiced views about ppl of other races. These sentiments are not restricted to any one racial group nor are they exclusively directed at only at any  one racial group. But I also belive that  an increasing majority of our society believe in racial harmony and will object to prejudice."
203314719715066_426537194059483,"A number of ppl have asked for more details on my post on gentleman who complained to me about Indians. He is an elderly person ( I refer to his grandchildren in th post ). He is born n bred here. I blv all th ppl he is complaining about are also Sporeans. He sent th complaint via email. some have asked or implied - whether he is referring to me , dont think so (!) . Have helped him previously, so he started off his email by thanking me for th previous help. He ended off his email by telling me that if the problems are not taken care of, he will know which way to vote in th next elections."
203314719715066_426361950743674,"I received a complaint from one of my residents, a few weeks ago.  He is Singaporean.  He was upset that he had to ""tolerate"" his Indian neighbours.  The resident protested at having to ""smell thier Indian sweaty smell and unwashed bodies"".  He described the Indian family as living in squalor and complained about their poor social status.  He then listed other Indians whom he found unpleasant - the Indian man smoking in the lift, the Indian woman with her dog, and his daughter's Indian neighbour who walks around in a sarong, and said that he didn't want his grandson growing up looking at Indian men in sarong.  

The complaint about smoking in the lift is understandable.

The rest of the complaints taken together however, are quite disturbing.  The resident actually sent me an email setting this out.  The resident appears to see his neighbour's race as being the problem and the overt prejudice is quite troubling.  Most Singaporeans would not agree with his perspective.  We need to make sure that things stay positive between people of different races."

During the 2 way trip, there were 3 incidents. First, as our lane was blocked for work, my wife  tried to pull into the next lane, after indicating. A van which was well behind then deliberately moved much much faster, and to make sure we couldnt pull into the lane. Second I saw a SUV zip in and out, almost causing an accident - without bothering to indicate. Third, a lorry simply came into our lane, without indication and without giving enough allowance - almost an accident. The driver simply didnt care because of the lorry's size. I wonder if it is the case that we are simply noticing this more, or if indeed our driving habits have become worse."

On corruption, I made the point that corruption and vice have existed in all societies, from time immemorial, and is referred to even in the holy books. We are not immune from such behaviour. There will always be people who are corrupt, everywhere, including Singapore. This has always been so and will continue to be so. But we are different compared with most other countries in that the system as a whole is not corrupt, and our system often ensures that corruption is brought to light and the corrupt men severely punished. As a result, we are one of the cleanest societies in the world, (and this is recognised internationally) and there is no systemic corruption. 

I also made the point that one of our bedrock principles is equality of opportunities, and that we need to constantly evaluate our policies to ensure that we remain a society where there is equality of opportunities. One area where we need to look at and invest more is preschool education - which is an area I have been very keen on. We have in Chong Pang started, some years ago, a pilot programme to try out a different type of preschool programme. I hope that we will invest much more in preschool education so that everyone regardless of background can get excellent preschool education."

203314719715066_419960268050509,"Among the issues that are regularly brought to my attention are noise disturbances in residential areas.  Certain regulations restrict when noisy renovation or construction work can take place.  In HDB flats, noisy renovation work (demolition of walls etc) can take place only from 9am to 5pm on weekdays.  As for construction sites, NEA does not allow work from 10pm on Saturday to 7am on Monday.  The same applies for public holidays.  In addition, NEA enforces noise limits, and requires contractors to take noise abatement measures.  NEA also works with industry to leverage on technology and best practices to reduce construction noise.  This is an ongoing process.
 
It is of course quite frustrating to have to put up with  hour after hour of construction noise.  Unfortunately, as long construction and renovation takes place, we cannot completely eliminate the noise they produce.  Some of this is due to ppl renovating /constructing their homes and in other cases because of necessary public works  - the completion of  public infrastructure such as schools, roads or MRT lines.
 
We have to balance the needs of the different interests in these situations."

Basically people have asked 4 questions : (1) why was he not charged under s204 of the Penal Code, and instead  was charged under the RTA. The Penal Code charge would carry a heavier sentence is what is used now (2) Why was he charged for abetment (3) why was Dr Wu imposed only with a fine under the RTA (4) Why has it taken so long for the case to come to court when the offence took place in 2006. I spoke witht he media and gave answers to the 4 questions, based on what I ws told by the AGC. Emphasised 2 other points as well : that the decision to prosecute is made by AGC independantly and the sentence is imposed by the court also independantly. Until the court delivers a written judgement we wont know the reasons for the precise reasons for the decision. Second, the speeding offence is still being investigated. When that is completed there may be further prosecution. With that in mind, the answers to the 4 questions are as follows : (1) Dr Wu could not be charged under s204 of the Penal Code because that only came into force in 2008. Dr Wu's offense was committed in 2006. You cant charge anyone who committed an offense in 2006 under a provision which came into force in 2008. (2) He was charged for abetment because the actual info was given by Mr Kuan. Dr Wu didnt give the info and could not be charged directlyfor giving false info. AGC didnt charge Mr Kuan, I assume because he was old and AGC probably took into account the employer-employe relationship, and that justice will probably be best served by charging Dr Wu (3) why was he imposed only with a fine. We will know the reasons if the court gives a written judgment. Can only guess at this stage, at what the reasons might be. I was told by AGC that there was no evidence of any money being paid, there were no repeated offences, as well as a few other possible reasons. AGC also told me that a fine , under these circumstances would be within the norm (4) why has it taken so long - when the info was first given in 2006, Police assumed it to be correct. It was only more recently that the Police found out about the offence, through a complaint that was received."

What Makes Singapore Different? - Joergen Oerstroem Moeller

As a Dane who has lived in Singapore for more than 14 years, I naturally find similarities between Singapore’s and Denmark’s endeavours to carve out a niche for themselves in the harsh climate of economic globalisation.

Both countries try as best they can to use their geographical position to their advantage. The basic idea of the hub strategy comes naturally to the fore.

Countries like the United States and China use their domestic markets as a platform for economic strength. That is even feasible for middle-sized countries being well-established in certain segments of the global market. For example, in Europe, France in luxury products (fashion, haute couture, wine) and Germany in engineering. In Asia, Thailand in agricultural products and Vietnam in seafood. These countries brand themselves via a strong position in industrial segments, producing first for the domestic market before subsequently being turned into an export industry.

Neither Singapore nor Denmark can do likewise. They need to find something else to brand them – to be different. And they need branding because high-cost countries – and Singapore has, for some years, been in that category – find it agonising to compete on wages and prices. For such a strategy to be successful at all, it requires a tremendous effort, as the competition is with a whole string of countries with a much larger pool of labour, thus benefiting from lower wage cost. Singapore must do something else, something better to lift itself out of this box, and branding is an obvious way. A brand offers something more than just the user value. The consumer enjoys something special by using a branded product and is ready to pay a higher price for that special ‘something else’.

Singapore’s brand pertains to efficiency, reliability, good corporate governance, good government, and rule of the law – factors which attract multinational companies.

For years, Singapore’s harbour and shipping sector have been an important element in the country’s economy and employ a large number of Singaporeans. These days, few people realise that it was by no means certain that Singapore would be the busiest harbour in Southeast Asia and among the largest container harbours in the world. It was achieved by realising that efficiency and the ability to deliver high-quality services every time a ship docks, which in turn conveys to shipping lines that Singapore could be relied upon. This brought about a virtuous circle: the larger the number of shipping lines which uses Singapore’s harbour to their satisfaction, the more likely new shipping lines inter alia serving the Chinese market and/ or established in China would also use it.

Having acquired the knowledge of running a harbour competently, Singapore’s next step was to use that as a competitive parameter in offering this knowledge to harbours in other countries, supplemented by investing in harbour facilities in some of these markets.

The Global Competition

Building an airline and an airport which, year after year, are ranked among the best in the world illustrates how a country using the hub concept can overcome the disadvantage of a small domestic market and establish itself as an important player in the global competitive game.

Now Changi Airport seems a natural place for an air travel hub in Asia, but a look at the map shows that this fruit could have been plucked by many countries. Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia are all as well positioned as Singapore, maybe even better, and might have supplemented that with a larger domestic market.

They have done so, yes, but Singapore grasped better than its competitors one of the essential things in global competition: you move in with both feet and wholehearted commitment, or you stay away. As the famed American general George S Patton said: Get there firstest with the mostest.

There is a good deal of risk associated with the hub concept in areas such as shipping and air transport. The investment required is enormous and cannot be changed with a snap of the finger.

Therefore good planning and strategic foresight are indispensable to ensure the success of the hub concept.

In these areas, Singapore can also be described as a hub.

There are not many cities around the world that welcomes the global intellectual elite for lecture tours, seminars, conferences and brain-picking as consistently as Singapore. These people come to Singapore to share their knowledge and ideas about future trends, and by doing so, they enhance Singapore’s knowledge, which explains why Singapore enters the high-risk investment game with so much confidence.

The picture is the same when looking at the fields of Information and Communication Technology and biotechnology. Likewise for education and healthcare. A country choosing the hub concept and branding itself as a hub prospers by cultivating a stimulating intellectual climate and making itself an attractive place for talent.

Mega-cities and Mega-regions

There is much talk about mega-cities and mega-regions as drivers of global growth in the years ahead. These economic powerhouses possess sufficient weight to forge ahead on their own, as is the case for, inter alia, Shanghai and several other Chinese cities. They show us that Thomas Friedman’s message (in The New York Times) that the world is flat conveyed a basically correct analysis – in the global
economy, everybody competes with everybody else. But there is another aspect to this, which is the notion that the world is also spiky, meaning that economic activities tend to be concentrated in large cities, hence mega-cities and/or mega-regions.

The gist of this dawned upon me in 1994 when I visited Seattle. I was shown an analysis pinpointing the key advantages of being in Washington State for biotech and medtech industries. The absolute top scorer was quality of life with 35 per cent, followed by high quality of work force accounting for 21 per cent. Academic institutions came in as number three with 19 per cent. Income tax and cost of living scored a meagre 6 per cent. This is what started me
thinking about quality cities. I later talked with the Head of Research of Novo Nordisk (a world leader in diabetes), and he told me that the company encouraged researchers to take an interest in cultural life because it would enhance their powers of observation – a vital ingredient when judging whether a research project was worth pumping money into. I have often thought about this lesson: It is not so much the research as its applicability and the interdisciplinary, intersectoral approach to get there. That leads to quality cities!

What has not attracted so much attention, but unquestionably will in the future, is the notion of quality cities offering an economic and intellectual climate that attracts multinational companies and the intellectual elite to place some of their activities there. These global players do not put all their eggs in one basket; they spread them around, thus opening the door for quality cities to get a share of these lucrative activities taking place at a high, and in some cases the highest, level on the value-added ladder.

This is what the hub concept offers, and looking at Singapore over the past 14 years, what strikes me most is seeing how this concept has sunk deep roots in Singapore.

There has been overwhelming response, expressing sympathy for the family, and offers of support. I can really sense the compassion with which so many of you have responded.  It really is heartwarming to be reminded that we live amongst caring individuals that make up our society.

As one of you highlighted the fragility of life and how unexpected and unplanned things can happen in one’s life and how this can impact not only the person involved but also his or her loved ones is not something I need to lay out.  We all know that life can present a myriad of twists and turns and the impact of which can be sometimes painful and challenging.  But worst of all is the feeling that you are facing the uphill battle of suffering alone.

Today it may be Mr. Cheng’s family’s turn and tomorrow may be mine or someone else’s.  There is never any telling when or what might happen.

With life being this way, it is always a good feeling to know that our community comprises caring folks that have a heart to reach out to others in need.  We don’t end up feeling so alone.  The pain and suffering of Mr Cheng’s family and the assistance that they will get has been publicized.  There are many whose plight and painful moments do not catch or just slips the media’s attention, like one of you commented.

In fact, just last week, there was another tragedy within our community, where a sole breadwinner left behind a family with 3 very young kids, with little public knowledge.  We have begun to assist them. Like for Mr Cheng's family, we will try to help this family in a structured and sustained way, and have been thinking of how we can raise the funds to help them.

In our Chong Pang community, many residents have come and continue to come forward to share their pain and challenges in life with me and my team of volunteers.  Over the years they have not only trusted us to open up their hearts to share their suffering with us, but also allowed us to walk alongside them during their time of need and help them get back on their feet.  Although we haven’t been able to help in every situation, we have been able to help many.

I was asked how we are going to help Mr Cheng’s family. As I had
previously stated, I have spoken with several government agencies, a Foundation and my grassroots leaders. We need to speak with the family to fully assess their needs. The family needs some time to absorb what has happened before they can be ready to deal with other issues. Once they are ready, we will speak with them. Our assessment, based on what we know (which may or may not be fully accurate) is that they will need help with their HDB flat, living expenses, and educational expenses.

People have also emailed me offering to help the family. We are now thinking of the best way in which the help can be co-ordinated."

Then had a lunch meeting with 2 very enterprising Singaporeans who have made it good and want to contribute to society. Discussed the idea of providing scholarships to tertiary students. Went to my MFA office in the afternoon, after lunch.   This evening I hosted dinner for the Jordanian Ambassador to the UN. We work well with Jordan in international fora. The Ambassador had good insights on several Mid East related issues."

Their qualification for Champions League next season is now at risk. Arsenal frequently do this to themselves, and for their fans like me, it is frequently frustration and admiration ( for their play) in equal measure."

When I first took on the position of FM, I went on record to say that a person like him comes only once in several generations. My conversation with him today strongly reaffirmed ( to me) that view! He has the ability to look into the future, and predict the trajectory of events, aided by a strong sense/knowledge of history, culture and politics. And he has the ability to think differently from the well travelled road. He also has excellent relationships with so many important people around the world - relationships which Spore needs. 

A serious loss to Spore and a tremendous gain for the companies that he is working for."

Followed by a lunch meeting with former Senator Charles Robb. Senator Robb is a highly respected figure inWashington, heads committees, and is a v good freind of Spore. Talked about the international situation and got his insights. Received UNSG Ban Ki Moon at the airport. Then had meeting followed by dinner with Israeli DPM and Foreign Minister, Liberman.

203314719715066_336396509743837,"There have been questions raised as to whether it really can be the case that a person earning $1000 can buy a flat. MOS Tan Chuan Jin has given a clear explanation showing that indeed a person on such an income can buy a flat, with subsidies received from the Govt. There are actual cases where people have bought flats.

https://www.facebook.com/notes/tan-chuan-jin/earn-1000-a-month-and-you-want-to-buy-a-flat/338028739573241

Additional comment from MOS Tan Chuan Jin (as posted in the comments section of the above note): 

This note is not about whether one can survive on $1000 or not. It is about the range of housing possibilities we provide to help the low income. It starts with rentals and then home ownership for those who can purchase.

In this instance, 2 room flats are provided for those earning under $2,000 (combined income) per household. It is still an individual's choice if he wants to purchase or not.

If you feel that you are better off not buying and renting instead, and if you qualify, rental remains an option.

Would you feel better if we scrap this option? And not allow those at these income levels to have these possibilities? We believe that these options help and much depends on individual households and situation. But the option is available.

For the household earning $1000, they could service the loan with their CPF. But if they prefer not to, it is also their choice to service part cash and part CPF or with cash in total. But the point we raise in the loan being able to be covered by CPF completely, is that he is able retain his cash from his income to upkeep his family with his disposable income.

This is where the thread becomes one of whether one could survive on $1000 or not. Well, there are families on this level of income, and even less. Circumstances vary amongst them. Some have kids and parents, some are just a couple. Some have incurred various debts, some have been discipined and prudent.

I work with many of my residents fall into these categories. Unlike many of you, they earn $1,000 and less. They all manage in their own way. Some do so with assistance. And there is a range of help available. Some without. Yes, some without. 

And some are married. Some with children. And they are good people whom I have a great deal of regards for. 

The housing possibility means that he can own the flat eventually. Some will say that his retirement needs would be zero or extremely low if his CPF was used just to service the housing loan. 

You are assuming he is unable to improve his lot and remains where he is. You are assuming the rest of his family does not work nor contribute to this $1,000. You are assuming their children do not make good in relative terms.

If he really remained at $1,000 or that equivalent, he would, in 20-30 years time own his flat. Depending on CPF alone would be inadequate for retirement. I think if he had remained on $1,000/mth for the rest of his life, and had rented (cash outlay) instead of bought the flat, his retirement adequacy would also be low. 

With the flat, there is the possibility of lease buy-back. If he has children to stay with, he could sell the flat or rent it out. If he had rented, he would not have these options though he would have more CPF to draw on.

Clearly for those who for one reason or other are stuck at certain low income levels, and who have not broken out of their zones, public assistance can come in to assist. This remains so at any stage of their lives.

And yes, Singaporean families at about $1,000 household incomes did apply for these flats. 

Some have already collected their keys."

It details the considerable progress that our community and NGOs have made , working together with the agencies. Several points raised in the First Forum have been addressed, and there is progress in other areas as well. It has been very satisfying , working with the very committed NGOs, over the last year. In summary, the following points are worth noting:

•	The AVA, Cat Welfare Society and 4 town councils have launched the Stray Cat Sterilisation Programme in July 2011. Under the scheme, AVA subsidises 50% of sterilisation costs and micro-chipping for cats. In Chong Pang, the Sembawang Nee Soon Town Council is subsidising the other 50% of the cost, making the sterilisation and microchipping of stray cats in Chong Pang cost free.
•	MND, AVA and Cat Welfare Society are currently working out the details for a pilot programme which will allow residents in Chong Pang to keep cats in their HDB flats. The key here is that residents will only be allowed to house stray cats, rather than buying cats from the pet shop. This will significantly improve the cat adoption rates in Singapore.
•	MND, AVA, ASD and SPCA are also working on a pilot programme for rehoming stray mongrel dogs in HDB flats which will be launch later this year.
•	To lower the culling rates in Singapore and AVA has established a framework for rehoming any captured strays.
•	We are looking into setting up a National Adoption Centre which was one of the recommendations from the last forum. This centre will be managed by ASD and Animal Lovers League. It will provide a dedicated community facility that supports and encourages adoption in a way that benefits the animals, our environment, and the community. 
•	AVA is currently not using the services of Francis Lee. 
•	AVA in collaboration with SPCA have also developed guidelines on the humane capture of stray animals.
o	The animal control companies engaged by AVA must comply with the guidelines to avoid inflicting injury, fear, and other psychological distress on the animals. 
o	AVA will perform checks on all animals received to detect and investigate injury caused by inhumane capture.
o	Lastly AVA will publish these guidelines on their website. They will also publish the guidelines for the assessment of capture strays for their adoption suitability and members of the public are welcomed to provide feedback on these guidelines so that we can improve them.
•	To tighten regulations in the puppy mill industry, AVA is looking into establishing a licensing requirement for individual commercial breeders instead of the current blanket license to the main farm owner, to guarantee responsible and humane dog breeding, and raise standards of care for dogs in breeding facilities. AVA is also looking into publishing the list of dog breeders when they license them.
•	AVA will be looking into arrangements for AWGs to accompany their officers for inspections to puppy farms.
•	AVA is considering making it mandatory for all pet shops and farms to license dogs at the point of sale. All dogs will be licensed during their second vaccination and microchipping. When they are sold, the license will be transferred to the owners.
•	A national microchip database will be established where pets are registered in an integrated database to enable tracking of pet information and identification of owners of abandoned pets.
•	AVA is reviewing the Animals and Birds Act, including Sections 42 and 44 pertaining to Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to further strengthen it and we welcome more feedback on possible amendments.
•	MOE will consider enhancing the aspect of responsible pet ownership and animal welfare in the design of the new Character and Citizenship Education Programme in schools. AVA is also working closely with AWGs to expand their responsible pet ownership programme.
•	SAF military dogs who are not adopted after retirement will be cared for at the SAF kennels for the rest of their lives. They will not be put to sleep because no one adopts them. 
•	Similarly, SPF holds adoption drives and works closely with animal welfare groups such as Gentle Paws to ensure that all dogs who are suitable for adoption are adopted, and not put down.  
•	NParks is working together with AVA to consider alternative population management control for macaques measures besides culling, such as sterilisation.

Speech by Mr. Louis Ng, Executive Director, ACRES
Singapore Animal Welfare Symposium and Public Forum on Animal Welfare Policies
25 February 2012
Chong Pang Community Club


Mr. K Shanmugam, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Law and MP for Nee Soon GRC, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

A very good afternoon and, on behalf of ACRES, Chong Pang YEC, Chong Pang grassroots, NUS PEACE, Young NTUC and the PAP Community Foundation, thank you so much for joining us at the Singapore Animal Welfare Symposium and Public Forum on Animal Welfare Policies.

The animal protection movement is undoubtedly growing exponentially in Singapore, and there has indeed been much progress over the past year. 

Let me spend the next ten minutes sharing with you some of the progress we have made together following the first-ever public form on animal welfare policies last June.

Many of us are very concerned about the plight of the stray cats and raised this during the last forum. I am pleased to inform you that the AVA, Cat Welfare Society and 4 town councils launched the Stray Cat Sterilisation Programme in July 2011. Under the scheme, AVA subsidises 50% of sterilisation costs and micro-chipping for cats. Here in Chong Pang, I’m proud to inform you that the Sembawang Nee Soon Town Council is subsidising the other 50% of the cost, making the sterilisation and micro-chipping of stray cats in Chong Pang cost-free.

We have also taken into consideration your feedback about allowing cat ownership in HDB flats. MND, AVA and Cat Welfare Society are currently working out the details for a pilot programme which will allow residents in Chong Pang to keep cats in their HDB flats. The key here is that residents will only be allowed to house stray cats, rather than buying cats from the pet shop. This will significantly improve the cat adoption rates in Singapore.

MND, AVA, ASD and SPCA are also working on a pilot programme for rehoming stray mongrel dogs in HDB flats which will be launched later this year.

We understand the need to lower the culling rates in Singapore, and AVA has established a framework for rehoming any captured strays.

Beyond rehoming the strays, however, we are also looking into setting up a National Adoption Centre, which was one of the recommendations from the last forum. Minister Shanmugam and MND are supportive of the proposal to set up this Centre which will be managed by ASD and ALL. It will provide a dedicated community facility that supports and encourages adoption in a way that benefits the animals, our environment, and the community. 

We are also looking into your feedback about the trapping of strays. We understand this remains a very emotive issue, but one which needs to be addressed.

I am pleased to inform you that AVA is currently not using the services of Francis Lee. 

AVA, in collaboration with SPCA, have also developed guidelines on the humane capture of stray animals.

The animal control companies engaged by AVA must comply with the guidelines to avoid inflicting injury, fear, and other psychological distress on the animals. 

AVA will perform checks on all animals received to detect and investigate injury caused by inhumane capture.

Lastly, AVA will publish these guidelines on their website. They will also publish the guidelines for the assessment of captured strays for their adoption suitability, and members of the public are welcome to provide feedback on these guidelines so that we can improve them.

The measures we have discussed so far are short-term or medium-term. We are, however, also looking into long-term solutions towards addressing the root of the problems.

Puppy mills are undoubtedly one important issue we must tackle. To tighten regulations in this industry, AVA is looking into establishing a licensing requirement for individual commercial breeders instead of the current blanket license to the main farm owner, to guarantee responsible and humane dog breeding, and raise standards of care for dogs in breeding facilities. AVA is also looking into publishing the list of dog breeders when they license them.

At the last forum, there were recommendations for animal welfare groups or AWGs to accompany AVA during their inspections of dog farms. I am pleased to inform you that AVA will be looking into arrangements for AWGs to accompany their officers for these inspections.

There is also a need to regulate the pet shop industry, and AVA is considering making it mandatory for all pet shops and farms to license dogs at the point of sale. All dogs will be licensed during their second vaccination and micro-chipping. When they are sold, the license will be transferred to the owners.

Following your recommendations, a national microchip database will be established where pets are registered in an integrated database to enable tracking of pet information and identification of owners of abandoned pets.

We have also taken your feedback with regard to the need to strengthen our animal protection legislation. AVA is reviewing the Animals and Birds Act, including Sections 42 and 44 pertaining to Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, to further strengthen it, and we welcome more feedback on possible amendments.

Beyond these, we all agree that education and creating awareness on animal welfare issues is the way forward. The recommendations from the last forum were forwarded to MOE and we are delighted that MOE will consider enhancing the aspect of responsible pet ownership and animal welfare in the design of the new Character and Citizenship Education Programme in schools. AVA is also working closely with AWGs to expand their responsible pet ownership programme.

We have also discussed your concerns about the fate of SAF and SPF service dogs once they are retired. I am delighted to inform you that SAF military dogs who are not adopted after retirement will be cared for at the SAF kennels for the rest of their lives. They will not be put to sleep because no one adopts them. Similarly, SPF holds adoption drives and works closely with animal welfare groups such as Gentle Paws to ensure that all dogs who are suitable for adoption are adopted, and not put down.  

Lastly, we have also discussed your concerns about macaque issues with NParks. I am pleased to inform you that NParks is working together with AVA to consider alternative population management control measures besides culling, such as sterilisation. 

I am sure that you will agree with me that there has undoubtedly been progress in the past year. By working together, by providing constructive feedback, and by engaging each other positively, we have achieved more for the animals. 

While some of us want progress to happen at a faster pace, which is understandable, we must ensure that we have a balanced approach and understand that there are always alternative views to animal protection issues. Ultimately, we share a common goal and ultimately we are heading in the right direction.

There are many more issues we need to address and we will continue to work on them, and we look forward to your constructive feedback at the forum session shortly.

Let us continue this journey together, let us remain positive that change is happening, and let us continue to be the voice for animals.

Once again, thank you so much for attending the event today and for helping to shape animal welfare policies in Singapore.

Thank you.

This was reflected in a 13 Feb Sin Chew Jit Poh commentary by Yin Yi Dao, “Singapore: A Small Country with a Big Voice”.  Excerpts:
 
- - - - - 

In the eyes of former Indonesian President Habibie, Singapore is just a red dot on the map, while Chen Tang-shan, Taiwan's Foreign Minister during the Chen Shui-bian era, derogatorily referred to Singapore as a ""piece of dried nasal mucus"". Regardless of how some people have described Singapore, it is indeed a tiny island state. But in the 50 years after its founding, Singapore has not only been playing a key role within the 10-member ASEAN grouping and the Five Power Defence Arrangement (the other members being Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia), it has also been engaging the big powers on the international stage. During the Cold War in the last century, Singapore had maintained good relations with the Western camp led by the US, and the Eastern Camp led by the Soviet Union. When China and Taiwan were in a state of hostility, Lee Kuan Yew was the messenger who shuttled between Beijing and Taipei. He eventually brokered the Wang-Koo meeting in Singapore in 1992, which opened the door to peace across the Taiwan Strait. In his 32 years as prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew had often made statements in the interests of the region and was lauded as a spokesman for Asian values. He is highly regarded by the Western media, academics and political leaders. 

Following the 911 attacks in 2001, the US went all out to fight terrorism and went to war with Iraq and Afghanistan. China, on the other hand, saw its overall national strength rise and its influence on Southeast Asian nations grow after it carried out reforms and opened up to the outside world. Amid close economic cooperation between Singapore and China, Lee Kuan Yew unexpectedly commented that he hoped the US would maintain its military presence in Southeast Asia to balance China's rise and that Singapore was prepared to let US naval vessels dock at its naval base to replenish supplies. As it was typical of Lee to speak on behalf of the interests of the region, China did not make any response... 

Speaking at the Singapore Conference organised by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in the US on 8 Feb 2012, Singapore Foreign Minister K Shanmugam opined that the US and China should cooperate and not confront each other. He said that while competition was inevitable, it could take place within a stable framework, with both countries playing a constructive role in world and regional affairs. He added that any attempt by the US to contain China would not be supported by countries in the region. 

Shanmugam is voicing what has been on the minds of China and the majority of Asians. This shows that the Singapore government has inherited Lee Kuan Yew's Cold War mentality of expressing Asians' hope for peace and a win-win situation for all countries, and of rejecting the idea that ""if you are not my friend, then you are my enemy"". What attracted the most attention was US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell’s prompt response.  He said that the US had referred to Singapore’s views more closely than those of any other countries before making any major foreign policy move.  The US is like a gigantic aircraft carrier that is trying to dock at a small harbour and Singapore is there to give directions…"

203314719715066_325807214132482,"On 14 February, I gave the keynote address at the Rule of Law Symposium organised by the Singapore Academy of Law, NUS and SMU. In my speech (available at http://app2.mlaw.gov.sg/News/tabid/204/Default.aspx?ItemId=618), I summed up Singapore’s approach to the rule of law in this way:

Singapore is committed to the Rule of Law. We recognise the universality of its principles, but also stress that their application must be adapted to each society. Exceptions to the Rule of Law must be closely scrutinised and strictly justified. We do not claim that our system works for everyone, or that it is perfect. Our system has worked well for us, in our circumstances. We are committed to continually improving our system. We will continue to engage in dialogue with others who are also committed to the rule of law, to improve.

On 15 Feb, I sat on a panel on the Rule of Law in Singapore with Professor Simon Chesterman, Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law; Mr James Silkenat, President-Elect Designate of the American Bar Association; Professor Thio Li-ann of the NUS Faculty of Law. I had an interesting exchange with Professor Joseph Weiler from NYU on the role and extent of the law of contempt. While we were not completely in accord, we did agree on the key points – the law should not obstruct discussions of the law and the legal framework, but this should not extend to allegations of judges acting for improper reasons. At the end of the panel, Mr Silkenat invited Singapore to act as a “counterweight” to China on the rule of law, and to share its experiences with developing countries in Asia and Africa. I replied that we were in no position to be a counterweight to China (or anybody!), but we will be happy to share our experiences, without claiming that they suit everyone.

After the Symposium, I had an informal dinner with some of the distinguished speakers from overseas: Mr Silkenat; Justice Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram, a former judge on the Malaysia Court of Appeal; Mr Mark Agrast, Chair of the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index; Professor Brian Tamanaha, Washington University School of Law; Mr Stuart Kerr of the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Attorney-General Sundaresh Menon and Justice V K Rajah were also present. Everyone agreed that this Symposium had been an useful exchange of views, and we should have more such exchanges in the future."
203314719715066_324659367580600,"Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Myanmar, 14 February 2012

    QUESTION:

    Assoc  Prof  Fatimah  Lateef:  To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs
    with  the  liberalization  and opening up of Myanmar recently, what is
    the  state  of  Myanmar's  bilateral  relations with Singapore and the
    larger ASEAN community.

    Dr Lim Wee Kiak: To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether ASEAN
    has set any progress targets for Myanmar before Myanmar takes over the
    chair of ASEAN in 2014 and, if so, what are these targets.

    REPLY:

             Sir  with  your  leave  I  will  take  the next two questions
    together.  Singapore and Myanmar enjoy good and longstanding bilateral
    relations.  We cooperate well bilaterally and in ASEAN.  Recently, the
    Myanmar President made a State Visit to Singapore.  That visit further
    affirmed  the  close  friendship  between  our  countries.  During the
    visit,  Myanmar’s  Foreign  Minister  and  I  signed  a  Memorandum of
    Understanding  between  our  two  governments on the Singapore-Myanmar
    Technical  Cooperation  Programme.  This underscores our commitment to
    support Myanmar with capacity-building in economic and human resources
    development, as well as public administration.

    2             Our  belief is that this is a good way to assist, as the
    need  for  trained  people  in  many  fields  is likely to increase in
    Myanmar.   Our  cooperation  on  capacity  building and human resource
    development goes back some way.  We have worked with Myanmar under the
    auspices of the Singapore Cooperation Programme.  Myanmar has been one
    of  the  largest recipients of our technical assistance.  We also made
    humanitarian  contributions  after  the  devastating Cyclone Nargis in
    2008.  The Myanmar government has appreciated the US$5 million that we
    disbursed  for  relief  efforts.   These  included the deployment of a
    medical  team,  the  building  of  a  hospital, tube-wells, as well as
    shelters  for the Cyclone survivors.  Professor Fatimah Lateef was one
    of the dedicated members of the Singapore medical team that helped the
    survivors.

    3            Bilateral cooperation is not confined at the governmental
    level.   A  Singapore  Business  Federation delegation is currently in
    Myanmar  to  explore  economic opportunities.  We hope to develop more
    links   with   Myanmar  as  the  country  opens  up  economically  and
    politically.

    4             Members  may  recall  that  in 2005, Myanmar voluntarily
    decided  to  skip  its  turn  as  Chair of ASEAN.  At that time, ASEAN
    Foreign  Ministers agreed to allow Myanmar to become the Chairman when
    it  was  ready.   In  October  2011, Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty
    Natalegawa,  in his capacity as Chair of ASEAN, visited Myanmar to get
    a  sense  of  ground  developments.   He  delivered a good report that
    reflected  on  the  positive  steps  taken by Myanmar.  As a result of
    these  positive  developments, ASEAN Leaders agreed at their Summit in
    November  2011  that  Myanmar  would  assume the ASEAN Chairmanship in
    2014.

    5             Singapore welcomes Myanmar’s Chairmanship in 2014. ASEAN
    has never set any specific preconditions or “progress targets” for any
    ASEAN  Chairmanship.  ASEAN has taken the position that Myanmar should
    be allowed to follow the seven step roadmap it has set for itself. The
    Chairmanship  presents  an  opportunity  for  Myanmar  to build on its
    current  momentum.   As ASEAN Chair, Myanmar will be the external face
    of  ASEAN.   It  will  have  to  defend not only its own interests and
    record,  but  also  ASEAN’s  interests.   Myanmar  will  also  have to
    reassure  our  external  partners  that  under its Chairmanship, ASEAN
    would  continue  to  make progress towards an ASEAN Community in 2015.
    The  world  will  be  watching.  Given the stakes, I am confident that
    Myanmar  will  work  hard  to  make  its ASEAN Chairmanship a success.
    Singapore  will  offer  to  work  with  Myanmar  to  ensure successful
    outcomes under its 2014 Chairmanship.

    Supplementary Questions:

    Dr  Lim Wee Kiak: Sir, let me just thank the Minister for his reply. I
    would  like  to  ask  the  Minister that yes, we are encouraged by the
    progress  and  by  the  reform  that is made by the Myanmar government
    currently  now.  In the event that they do not follow through with the
    7  steps  roadmap  that you have highlighted or in the event that they
    regress back in their reforms in the next two years itself, will there
    be any possibility of ASEAN reviewing the Chairmanship of Myanmar?

    Minister:  Sir,  in  foreign  policy  terms,  these  are  hypothetical
    questions  as  to  what  might  happen and what ASEAN might do, the 10
    members  of  ASEAN, should Myanmar fail to do certain things. First, I
    think  we  should  acknowledge the current position which is that that
    there had been significant developments in Myanmar which I have put on
    record  and  we  should  encourage those developments.  I think if the
    course  changes,  we  must look at that and consider and we will cross
    that bridge when we come to it.

    Assoc  Prof  Fatimah  Lateef: Thank you sir and thank you Minister for
    the  response. We know that there are long-standing economic sanctions
    especially  by  the West on their part.  So I am wondering how crucial
    to  the  ASEAN  members,  and  also  what the Minister thinks, are the
    uplifting of sanctions will open up the region even further.

    Minister:  ASEAN Foreign Ministers called for the lifting of sanctions
    and  we  were  quite  unequivocal  about  it  recently. We have always
    believed  that  sanctions  may  not  be  the best way to deal with the
    situation  in Myanmar. In my recent visit to the United States, I said
    that  publicly  as  well  as  with various influential Congressmen and
    women  that  I have met. The United States, as members might note, has
    made  a  number  of  reciprocal gestures as well in the context of its
    dealings  with Myanmar.  The lifting of sanctions is to be seen in the
    context  not so much of opening of the region as a whole but primarily
    to be seen in the interests of Myanmar.  And in the secondary context,
    when  we  do talk about the ASEAN Community in 2015, creating a centre
    of  600  million  people, creating physical and social connectivities,
    obviously  sanctions  against  any  particular  member is not the most
    helpful.   So  in  a number of contexts, we have always indicated that
    sanctions  ought  to be lifted.  And I think increasingly the response
    both by the United States and the Europe Union has been positive."

Edited excerpt of remarks made by Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, DPM and Minister for Finance and Manpower at the Institute of Policy Studies' Singapore Perspectives 2012 conference this week.

---------------------------------------

BUILDING a fair and inclusive society is at the heart of our role as
Government.

It is about both social and economic strategies, as they are bound
inextricably together. The first question we must always ask ourselves is:
how do we make our living in the world? How does Singapore move up in
manufacturing, how do we gain appeal as a global city, in services, and how
can we ensure that those who do well are not just those in the top 20 per
cent but also average Singaporeans and those in the bottom 20 per cent of
incomes?

The story of how China and other emerging countries have depressed wages
for low-skilled jobs all over the world is well-known. But the next chapter
has also begun. Pressure is shifting to the middle of the workforce, as
more white-collar jobs are replaced by technology or cheaper competition.
The result has been stagnant middle class incomes in most developed
economies, in some cases a real decline over more than a decade.

An inclusive society therefore starts with economic strategies - competing
in the global economy in a way that everyone gets pulled up. We are putting
great effort and resources into this - raising the quality of every job,
the skills and expertise of every worker, and giving them the confidence
that they will be able to stay in demand.

Second, we need social strategies to deal with the challenge of inequality.
We have a higher Gini coefficient in Singapore compared to most larger
countries, because we are a global city. Hong Kong, London, the key
American cities, and the leading Chinese and Indian cities in fact have
somewhat higher inequality than Singapore.

But we cannot resign ourselves to widening inequality. Unlike these other
cities, we are a country. We have to try to contain inequality, and
ameliorate its effects on our society.

The most important way must be to spread out opportunities from young, and
preserve social mobility. And just as important, we must preserve a sense
of compact among Singaporeans, a sense of obligation on the part of those
who are doing well to help others in their own society. We cannot build an
inclusive society without that spirit of inclusiveness. It is not just a
matter of getting the right government policies.

We still have reasonable mobility in our schools. Look at the PSLE (Primary
School Leaving Examination). Among students from the bottom third of
socio-economic backgrounds, half do well enough to end up in the top
two-thirds of the PSLE cohort. And one out of every six from the bottom
third ends up in the top third. Not many school systems see that among
12-year-olds. And if we look at children who live in one- to three-room HDB
flats, almost half of them eventually make it into university or
polytechnic. This is an unchanged proportion compared to a decade ago.

We know that it will get more difficult over time to sustain mobility.
That's why we have to do more, and especially to do more upstream. We have
to try new ways to help kids from disadvantaged families gain confidence in
their early years, and find their strengths as they go through the school
system. Let's also intervene actively to help them in their teens, when
some inevitably find themselves at a loose end. Get them engaged in CCAs,
give them responsibilities, and not just to keep them in school for the day
but so they can enjoy school. Much better that we intervene upstream than
wait for problems to surface later.

We are also tackling some worrying, more complex trends among families -
those that go through early divorces, or where one or sometimes two members
are incarcerated, and the children lack the normal sense of a family. These
are still micro trends, but we must prevent them growing, and prevent a
permanent underclass forming over time. We have to address these problems
early, and especially help the kids stay on track.

Thirdly, we have to redistribute. Our fiscal policies must be progressive,
which means most of the benefits being received by lower income citizens
and most tax revenues being paid by those at the upper end.

The key question is how we do this. How do we maintain and strengthen our
progressive slant, do more to support those at the lower end, while
ensuring that we remain a society where at the core, people do have a deep
sense of responsibility for their families, do want to work hard to improve
themselves, and take pride in being part of a society where everyone moves
up together that way? Progressive-minded people have to be deeply concerned
about this, not just social conservatives.

It means intervening boldly to help lower income families, but focusing on
the right areas. We're doing more to support them in education; to make
jobs pay better for them through Workfare and training; to enhance housing
grants so lower income couples can own their own homes; and to ensure they
can afford good quality health care through targeted subsidies as well as
Medifund.

Adding it up, we have made this a more progressive fiscal system over the
last 10 years. It may seem counter-intuitive, because we lowered income
taxes and raised the goods and services tax (GST), which taken on their own
would have been regressive moves. But a fiscal system can only be evaluated
by looking at both taxes and benefits received by the population, not
either one by itself. Lower income Singaporeans now receive more benefits,
even after deducting the extra GST they pay. Through education, work,
housing and health care, we have tilted the system further in their favour.

We must also keep the tax burden on the middle class low. That's an
essential feature of our system, and we are quite different from most
developed countries in this regard. Some of them have highly progressive
systems - with large benefits for the poor and certain other groups, but
the quiet fact is a high tax burden on the middle class (even after netting
off the benefits they receive in return). The reality of the matter is that
it is not just the rich who pay for their welfare systems. In Britain, for
example, despite very high top rates of income tax, the top 10 per cent
pays a lower share of total taxes than in Singapore.

There is more that we want to do. This includes how we help older
Singaporeans meet their needs - help them if they wish to stay employed,
and help ease their fears over medical costs. They may be short of savings
too, but have value in their homes which can be unlocked. It does involve
some change in attitudes, a willingness to downsize, but look at what's
happening with studio apartments. They are a real hit with the elderly -
not just nicely designed, but small units with 30-year leases, so they get
significant savings by downsizing from their existing flats.

Our policies are not sacrosanct. But let's keep a sense of perspective as
we discuss how we should evolve and improve them. We have a system that has
preserved low unemployment. Our median incomes have continued to grow over
the last decade and especially over the last five years - more than in
countries at the same level of advancement. The average citizen's income is
one of the highest in Asia and higher than in several developed countries.
Our median income level is about 20 per cent higher than in Hong Kong, 30
per cent higher than in Korea and Taiwan, and similar to the UK - all
adjusted for PPP (purchasing power parity) using the World Bank's
estimates, so this measures real standards of living. Even if we allow for
possible imprecision in estimates, the conclusions are clear. Our
strategies are not doing badly for average Singaporeans.

A last point, but an important one. As we take further steps to build an
inclusive society, we must be able to sustain what we do financially and
not store up problems for the future. Short political horizons are never
helpful. It is how most of the developed countries built up public spending
in excess of revenues even during their youthful and rapid growth years,
and now find themselves with unsustainable debts just as their societies
age. Japan, the US and many European countries will have to spend a
significant part of their government budgets each year - 3-4 per cent of
GDP - just to service their debts. They will need painful cuts in spending
to bring down these debt burdens, but it will take time. We are in the
reverse position. We used our rapid growth years to accumulate savings, and
are now in the unusual position of being able to add over 2 per cent of GDP
into our budget each year, by drawing on income from our reserves.

We have to preserve a system of sustainable finances, so that we keep this
position of strength as we address our challenges of helping the elderly
live well, and keeping social mobility alive. It will allow us to invest in
an inclusive society not just for two or three terms of Government, but for
our children's generation."

203314719715066_305910899455447,"Exchanges with MPs Sylvia Lim and Lina Chiam

Ms Sylvia Lim MP: 

Mr Speaker Sir, while the Bill amends many acts, I will focus on two sets of amendments—those affecting the Criminal Procedure Code and those affecting the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.

First, the Criminal Procedure Code or “CPC”. Clause 21(a) to (c) of the Bill amends the CPC with respect to bail. Clause 21(b) of the Bill amends s95(1)(a) to allow a court to consider whether to release an arrested person on bail in all cases except where the accused is charged with an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life. The provision when amended will allow a court to grant bail when an accused is charged with an offence which attracts imprisonment of 20 years or more which the current provision does not allow.

I support this amendment as it will give a court the discretion to decide whether to grant bail in such cases. The court can then apply the usual principles in deciding whether to grant or deny bail to an accused, looking at factors such as the seriousness of the offence and punishment, the risk of the accused absconding, and the risk of further offences being committed while he is on bail.

This amendment in clause 21(b) also rectifies an issue which recently arose in the case of Mohamed Hisham bin Sapandi v PP [2011] 4 SLR 868. There, the prosecution and defence had argued that the wording of the existing s95(1)(a) was capable of 2 different interpretations, as the term 20 years or more was ambiguous. In any event, the problematic clause will now be deleted.

Sir, since we are discussing s 95, there has been an issue surrounding this section, which would be good to clarify in this debate. Section 95(1) restricts the court granting bail in 3 situations. First, when the accused is charged with an offence punishable with death or life imprisonment, secondly where he is a proven flight-risk and the court believes he will continue to be so, and thirdly, where he is arrested and taken into custody under warrants issued under the Extradition Act. The issue of whether these restrictions under s 95(1) apply to only the Subordinate Courts or to the High Court as well arose in Mohamed Hisham’s case. This is because there is an unqualified provision in s 97(1) of the CPC which allows the High Court to grant bail to any accused before it, or release him on personal bond, or to vary the amount or conditions of bail or bond required by a police officer or the Subordinate Court as it deems fit. In Mohamed Hisham’s case, even the Deputy Public Prosecutors appeared to accept that the HC’s power to grant or vary bail was not fettered by s 95. This view was accepted by the High Court in Mohamed Hisham’s case. However, it was noted that there had been an earlier conflicting High Court decision in S Selvamsylvester v PP [2005] 4 SLR 409, which held that the High Court’s power to grant bail was subject to restrictions in the equivalent sections of the former CPC. As the High Court appears to be grappling with what Parliament’s intention is in enacting the bail provisions under the old and new CPC, could this Bill have included an amended to clarify the position once and for all, or
would Minister assist at least to clarify what Parliament’s intention is on this issue?

Sir, now I move to amendments concerning the Miscellaneous Offences Act, or “MOA”. Under clause 28 of the Bill, the Commissioner of Police may authorise any person or class of persons to possess truncheons, which are batons, handcuffs, or specified weapons or equipment in a public place if the Commissioner deems it necessary. This amendment already widens the worrying s 22A of the Act, which allows the Commissioner to authorise persons in the private security industry to carry such items in public. The existing s 22A was inserted in August 2007, and at that parliamentary debate, I raised my concern about giving private security personnel such items when they did not have police powers nor receive the same training. Some of these items are meant for use in physical confrontations with
members of the public. As security officers generally have only citizens’ powers which are limited, the risk of use of excessive force may arise. Should security officers become overzealous, or even in good faith, act but cause injury to the public, would the citizen be left to simply to sue the individual security officer and his employer? In other countries, the accountability of private security officers’ for wrongful acts has been a big issue, and it is a matter of time, I feel, before this surfaces here. Now, clause 28 proposes to widen the position even further. The amendment will allow the Commissioner of Police to include any person or class of
persons to carry truncheons, handcuffs, or specified weapons and equipment. This new provision raises even more concerns. I would like Minister to clarify which categories of people the Commissioner has in mind for this provision, and what safeguards are in place to protect the public against excessive force or abuse.

Mrs Lina Chiam NCMP:

Statutes Miscellaneous Amendments Bill. Mr Speaker Sir, may I draw the
attention of this house to the Bankruptcy Act, which Clause 13 of this Bill
seeks to amend. This clause makes changes to the amendment of bankruptcy
cases in court and to bankruptcy applications. I have two questions for the
Minister. Firstly, can the Minister provide us with the number of bankrupt
individuals sent for debt restructuring schemes against the number of those
who have been discharged in the past year? What I would like to know is
whether the numbers of bankrupt individuals are increasing or dropping, or
if a majority of them are simply sent for debt restructuring schemes.
Secondly, I am reminded of a recent case that was reported last month
December 2011, in which the bankruptcy orders of 3 former directors of the
National Kidney Foundation, Richard Yong, Matilda Chua and the late Loo Say
San were annulled. This has not been sufficiently examined by the media.
Would the Minister give details of this case and an account of the
annulment of the Bankruptcy Order of these ex-directors of the NKF? I am
sure Singaporeans would like to know more about bankruptcy laws in
Singapore and how they have been applied to major cases like the NKF saga
of 2006. Thank you.

Minister Shanmugam:

Sir, if I may deal with Mrs Chiam’s questions first. As to the precise
numbers which are sent for Debt Restructuring versus bankruptcy, I’m afraid
you should file a question and then I can get the data out. Likewise, the
reasons why bankrupts get discharged from bankruptcy, the Act sets out the
requirements before you can get a discharge or annulment. And those
conditions are to be satisfied objectively before you can get the Orders.
So if you want to know precisely what happened in those cases, I would have
to, because I don’t track every single case of bankruptcy or reasons for
annulment, insofar as the law would allow and I need to check that, if you
file a question we’ll check it and provide the answer. Thank you.

As regards the two points made by the Honourable Member Ms Lim, I think the
question on bail and ss 95 and 97 is a valid one, and it was considered
late last year in Hisham’s case. The High Court held that its power to
grant or vary bail under s 97(1) would be redundant if it were qualified by
other provisions, specifically s 95(1). I think the statement is very clear
and directly on point in contrast with the earlier case which I think was
decided in 2005, our view is that that’s clear, the statutory language is
clear, the judgment is clear, and the latest decision sets out the law.
Nevertheless I thank the member for raising it, allowing me to clarify that
the discretion is unfettered. And if the issue arises again, we will
certainly amend to put that beyond doubt.

On the second concern on the power of the Commissioner of Police to
authorise the carrying, possession and so on of truncheons, handcuffs, I
think Ms Lim’s point, and a valid point again, I think is really on the
abuse of such powers. A number of laws provide for law enforcement officers
to carry such equipment needed for their work, for example, of course the
Police Force Act, the Immigration Act, the Misuse of Drugs Act, and so on,
including the Miscellaneous Offences Act as well. The present amendment
supplements those provisions by giving the Commissioner of Police a general
power to authorise the carrying, possession and control of these equipment.

But before he gives any authorisation, the Commissioner must be satisfied
that it is necessary in the circumstances and appropriate for the
permission to be given. Authorisations would be granted to law enforcement
officers who need to carry or possess the relevant equipment in the course
of their work, and that authorisation will have to be stringently assessed,
conditions will be imposed on authorised persons, including proper training
for the use of the equipment, limits on where, when and the purposes for
which the equipment can be used, proper safekeeping and issuance of the
equipment, and the type and specifications of the equipment.

And a person who breaches a condition will be acting outside his authority
to carry, possess, control or use the equipment. If he does so in a public
place, meaning if he acts contrary to the authorisation in a public place,
that would be a criminal offence. And if there is an unauthorised use of
force, that may disclose further offences, and those acts will be seriously
investigated. Any abuser of powers will be disciplined or prosecuted, and
their authorisations will  also of course be revoked.

So I thank the Member for raising the question and allowing me to set out
the framework within which these powers can be exercised. Thank you.

Sylvia Lim:

Thank you, Sir. Two clarifications for Minister. Minister mentioned in his
response that, for MOA amendments, it is envisaged that Commissioner of
Police would be authorising law enforcement officers to carry such items.
But the existing provision actually foresees people from the private sector
to do that, the existing s 22A talks about private security. So I would
like Minister to clarify: does it actually there are going to be, besides
private security, other people in the private sector within CP’s radar for
such authorisation?

Secondly, this is a suggestion. I wonder if the Ministry has considered if,
for these private sector people, whether there should be additional
insurance against public liability taken up, to protect possible members of
the public who need to lodge civil claims for compensation, at least to
ensure their claims will be met.

Minister Shanmugam:

Thank you. I will answer both questions on behalf of Minister for Home
Affairs. My understanding is that it’s not envisaged that private persons
beyond the private security industry professionals are intended to be the
beneficiaries of the exercise of these powers. If there is a further
clarification on that I will certainly come back, but that’s my
understanding of the current position.

On the point about insurance, I think it’s a fair point that if they have
these powers there are potential victims, albeit they will be acting ultra
vires and illegally. Nevertheless I think insurance is a factor that
Commissioner should take into account before giving such authorisation. I
accept that."
203314719715066_305568236156380,"Second Reading Speech on the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill

18 Jan 2012 

 
Introduction
 
1.             Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, “That the Bill be now read a second time.”
 
2.             Sir, there are 33 operative clauses in this Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill.
 
3.             I will highlight only the key amendments.
 
Appeals from statutory tribunals
 
4.             Clauses 2 to 6 gives or provides for the procedure for the Rules of Court to prescribe a process for governing appeals from certain statutory tribunals.
 
5.             These appeals now proceed as district court appeals, and with the amendments, these appeals will proceed by way of originating summons, which is a simpler procedure.
 
6.             The tribunals affected are:
 
(a)           the Commissioner of Labour, in respect of his decisions under the Employment Act and the Work Injury Compensation Act;
 
(b)           the Goods and Services Tax Board of Review;
 
(c)           the Income Tax Board of Review; and
 
(d)           the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents.
 
Quorums of statutory boards
 
7.             Clauses 7 to 10 deal with quorums required for meetings of certain statutory boards, to bring them in line with the quorums required for other statutory boards. 
 
8.             The revised quorums require one-third of the total number of members on the board, or the current quorum, whichever is higher.     
 
9.             The affected statutory boards are:
 
(a)           the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority;
 
(b)           the Energy Market Authority of Singapore;
 
(c)           the Singapore Medical Council; and
 
(d)           the National Environment Agency.
 
Disclosure of information under the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act
 
10.          Clause 15 amends the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act. It provides for information to be supplied under the Act or the Chemical Weapons Convention to be disclosed for national security purposes.
 
Powers of forensic pathologists in coroner’s inquiries
 
11.          Next, Clause 19, relating to the Coroners Act 2010. It enhances the powers of forensic pathologists. It enables them to more effectively investigate causes of death.
 
12.          Forensic pathologists will now be able to obtain information, data, relating to the medical treatment or care of the deceased which are in the possession of a medical or healthcare professional.
 
13.          They will also be able to obtain medical records of the deceased from the National Registry of Diseases.
 
Reporting of suspicious transactions
 
14.          Clause 20 relates to the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act.
 
15.          The main amendment is to section 39, to clarify that the obligation to report suspicious transactions section includes attempted transactions.
 
16.          This amendment arises from Recommendation 13 of the Financial Action Task Force, that’s an intergovernmental body which develops and promotes policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
 
17.          The amendment to section 39 will put beyond doubt Singapore’s full compliance with Recommendation 13.
 
Remand of accused persons and granting of bail under criminal procedure
 
18.          Next, clause 21. This amends the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, and there are two main amendments.
 
19.          The first relates to the court’s discretion to grant bail.
 
20.          The amendments provide for the courts to grant bail in all cases except those where the accused person is charged with an offence punishable by death or life imprisonment.
 
21.          In such cases where the accused person is charged with an offence punishable by death or life imprisonment and also an alternative punishment, the court can also grant bail if the accused person is to be tried in the Subordinate Courts.
 
22.          The second main amendment refines the Subordinate Courts’ power to remand accused persons.
 
23.          Currently, a Magistrate can only remand an accused person for eight days at a time. There is no similar limit for the District Courts.
 
24.          We have received feedback from the Law Society that this does not work well.
 
25.          An accused person who is in remand pending trial must be brought before the court every eight days even though there are no updates to give to the court.
 
26.          This affects the Magistrates’ Arrest Cases, as well as committal and transmission cases, which are mentioned before Magistrates.
 
27.          With the amendments, there will no longer be a distinction between a Magistrate’s Court and a District Court with regard to remand.
 
28.          The distinction will be between cases where investigations are ongoing, and cases where investigations are complete.
 
29.          Where investigations are ongoing, an accused person can only be remanded for eight days at a time and must be brought before the court again if further remand is sought.
 
30.          This ensures that investigations are completed in good time and where applicable, bail can be offered as soon as possible after investigations are complete.
 
31.          Once investigations are complete, the accused person will be remanded pending the resolution of his case and if he is refused bail or cannot raise bail.
 
32.          At this point, no reason to require that he can be remanded only for eight days at a time.
 
33.          Sections 174 and 238 are to be amended accordingly, and that will allow more efficient management of cases by the courts.  
 
Notices of land acquisition
 
34.          Clause 23 amends the Land Acquisition Act. It is to primarily to change the mode by which interested persons are notified in relation to land acquisitions.
 
35.          Section 8(1) requires the Collector to notify interested persons by physically posting notices at or near the land to be acquired.
 
36.          The feedback is that owners prefer not to have this process.
 
37.          So we propose replacing that mode with a new requirement to publish notices in at least four daily local newspapers in each of the four official languages, which is more effective and reaches a larger audience. 
 
38.          This, of course, is in addition to other existing means of notification, which include notification in the Gazette, and sending registered letters to known interested parties.
 
Reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders
 
39.          Clause 26 clarifies and updates the provisions of the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act.
 
40.          First, the definition of “maintenance order” is expanded to allow the reciprocal enforcement of lump sum maintenance orders, in addition to orders for periodic payments, and that would better reflect the practice of local and foreign courts in awarding maintenance.
 
41.          The other amendments refine the scope and operation of the Act so as to better reflect how it operates in practice.
 
42.          One example is the removal of a provision that deems an applicant for maintenance as a legal custodian of the child.
 
43.          This deeming provision was originally taken from the United Kingdom. It is irrelevant in our local context because legal custody is not a pre-requisite for ordering maintenance.
 
Investment powers of trustees
 
44.          Clauses 33 and 34 relate to the Public Trustee Act, as well as the Trustees Act.
 
45.          They clarify that the Public Trustee, and trustees generally, can make specific investments that they were empowered to make before section 4(1) of the Trustees Act was amended in 2004. These amendments conferred upon the trustees a broad general power of investment.
 
Housekeeping amendments
 
46.          Finally, there are various housekeeping amendments have been made to various Acts, to improve the readability and administration of existing provisions and to repeal obsolete provisions.
 
47.          Sir, I beg to move."

Life gets better, yet people feel worse, by Janadas Devan
(Published in the Straits Times on 28 March 2004)

YOU'VE never had it so good, Harold MacMillan told the British electoratein the late 1950s. They believed him and voted for him resoundingly. TheSecond World War had ended barely 15 years earlier; people could stillremember bombed-out London; they could tell old Mac was telling the truth.

But if Harold Wilson had repeated the same statement in 1970, say, or MrTony Blair this year, few in Britain would have agreed, though both wouldhave been telling the truth also.

Progress is measurable and quantifiable. The statistics prove beyond doubtthat people in the industrialised world - which includes much of Europe,North America, Japan, Australia, and newly industrialising economies likeSingapore and Taiwan - are far better off than they were not only five to10 years ago, but better off than human beings have ever been in history.And yet, why are so few of us happy? Why do so many of us go through life fervently believing that if only things were a little better - the car atad more posh, the house a trifle bigger, the sofa just a little deeper,and so on and so forth - we would finally, really and truly, promise, behappy? And of course, when the car is a little more posh, the house alittle bigger, the sofa a little deeper, we persist with ourdissatisfactions.

Each shiny and alluring ceiling of material existence, once it is attained,turns almost instantaneously into a tawdry carpet underfoot. Get rid of thecarpet! Replace it with marble! But the marble, too, will, in due course,turn - or seem to - into cheap linoleum. Get rid of... The cycle repeatsitself endlessly, and will always end where it began - in disappointment.

It is amazing to reflect, but I remember Singapore's political leaderstelling the young not to forget how much better off they were than theirparents as far back as 1970, only five years after independence. Thirtyyears later, the politicians who were young then are telling today's youngthe same thing, and meeting the same incomprehension. Of course, I'm not better off. Of course, I will be satisfied if you politicians made my lifejust a little better. And of course, I won't be when you do.

Part of the reason few of us are convinced we are better off is thatprogress may be measurable but it cannot be directly experienced. It ispossible, of course, with the application of just a modicum of imagination,to recall how it felt living in a three-room Housing Board flat when one isnow living in a five-room HDB flat or a private condominium. But it takeseffort; the past is always a passing experience; and what occupies theforeground of one's mind is almost invariably the altogether imperiouspresent - and that bungalow I just saw in Queen Astrid Park.

Imagining progress over a longer timeframe - 100 years, say, or 500 - isvirtually impossible. You can tell a Londoner, for instance, look chum, 500years ago, your sewage system consisted of pigs, dedicated to St Anthonyfor some reason, roaming the streets, chomping on the muck. He might thank you for the information, but it wouldn't make an ounce of difference to his appreciation of the present.

Just 150 years ago, Londoners were still dumping everything - faeces,rotting vegetables and dead cats, not to mention 'the foul and gory liquidsfrom slaughter-houses' and 'the purulent abominations from hospitals anddissecting rooms', as one contemporary document put it - into stagnantpools that stood, as eternal as the Styx, between homes. It was not tillthe end of Victoria's reign, just 100 years ago, that all of London, richand poor, got a sewage system. One contemporary writer called it 'thegreatest achievement of our age'. And so it was.

But would it strike a contemporary Londoner as still great? Unless he issewage engineer, he wouldn't have given more than a moment's notice in his entire life to where his shit would go today after he flushes. Where itdidn't go to a hundred years ago would be a matter of profound indifference to him. He can flush now; it disappears; end of story. To all intents and purposes, that describes too our experience of progress: Time flushes it from our memories, both personal and historical.

Is it any wonder that progress, especially over long stretches of time, hasmade nobody happy? It is altogether real; economists and historians canprove its existence; but we can't experience, taste, feel or see it - soobviously, it has no power to move us. 'All told, except for the clamourand speed of society, and for trends in popular music, yourgreat-great-grandfather might say the contemporary United States' - orBritain, France, Japan and Singapore, for that matter - 'is the realisationof utopia'. Yet, virtually nobody in these countries feels that to be thecase.

As Mr Gregg Easterbrook notes in his learned recent book, The ProgressParadox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse, 'the percentage ofAmericans who describe themselves as happy' has not budged since the 1950s, though the typical person's real income more than doubled through that period. Happiness has not increased in Japan or Western Europe in the past half-century, either, though daily life in both those places has grown fantastically better'.

Mr Easterbrook, perhaps one of best writers on science today, citesnumerous studies that show that the most efficacious way to gain happiness today is for people to focus on the present. Citing what he calls the emerging science of 'positive psychology', he presents evidence that people who make an effort to be optimistic, grateful, forgiving, public-spirited, self-sacrificing and kind are more likely to be happy.

It's astonishing that after all the progress humankind has achieved overthe centuries, all of wisdom should boil down to something so simple even a child can understand it: Just try to be a little kinder, folks. It mightactually make you happier than owning a Lexus."

_________________________________
 
Mr Desmond Lee Ti-Seng (Jurong GRC)
 
Question:
 
To ask the Minister for Law in view of the Court of Appeal's recent ruling in the case of Muhammad bin Kadar & Anor v PP [2011] SGCA 44, whether there have been any changes to the operating procedures of the prosecution and law enforcement agencies on the disclosure of unused material in criminal cases and, if so, what are these changes.
 
Answer:
 
1.             Sir, I thank Mr Lee for his question. The Ministry of Law introduced a disclosure regime in the Criminal Procedure Code 2010. This change in the law was generally welcomed.
 
2.             During the Second Reading, I had said the following, in respect of general disclosure obligations:
 
“...  lawyers appearing in Court, whether Prosecution or defence lawyers, are officers of the Court. If they deliberately suppress material evidence, they will be acting in gross breach of their duties. One cannot put forward evidence in Court while holding back other evidence which could put a different complexion on the evidence that has in fact been tendered in Court. I have no doubt that the Court will take a serious view of such conduct.”
 
3.             In Muhammad Kadar’s case, the Court of Appeal referred to and relied on this statement, and explained the nature and extent of the Prosecution’s duty, to disclose material in its possession which it does not intend to use as part of its case.
 
4.             The Court of Appeal held that the Prosecution is under a legal duty to disclose two types of unused material in its possession.
 
(a)              Unused material which is likely to be admissible and might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused.
(b)              Unused material which is likely to be inadmissible, but would provide a real chance of pursuing a line of inquiry that leads to material that is likely to be admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused.
 
5.             Any doubt on these issues is to be resolved in favour of disclosure.
 
6.             Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government, the Judiciary and the Public Prosecutor are all charged with and concerned that each and every accused person have available all relevant and credible material in the Prosecution’s possession that may aid his or her defence. The application of the principle is a matter of judgment in each case. The Prosecution must assess its disclosure obligations professionally and in good faith.
 
7.             In the Kadar case, the Kadar brothers, Muhammad and Ismil, were initially charged for the murder of the victim in the flat she shared with her husband.  The husband of the victim told the police that there was only one assailant. This was recorded in a statement dated 4 September 2005.
 
8.             The Prosecution did not, at first, disclose the husband’s statement. The presence of both the accused persons at the scene was not initially disputed (though later, Ismil disputed this, when he gave notice of an alibi). Second, the husband was in poor health and immobile at the time of the alleged crime. He was in the bedroom while the victim was killed in the living room. And he could only give his statement through gestures; he could not speak. The Prosecution took the view that the husband was in no position to know how many assailants there were and that his evidence was unreliable.
 
9.             In March 2007, while the trial was ongoing, counsel for Muhammad and Ismil informed the Prosecution for the first time that Muhammad was taking sole responsibility for killing the deceased. The trial was stood down for the Prosecution to consider its position. Separately, defence counsel also applied to discharge themselves. The Prosecution decided to proceed against Muhammad and Ismil as charged. Given Muhammad’s position, the Prosecution, on 4 September 2007, disclosed Mr Loh’s statement which had been made on 5 September 2005 to the defence. This was six days before the trial resumed on 10 September 2007. Two sets of interview records (which were made before the statement was recorded, and were in the same terms as the statement) were also subsequently disclosed.
 
10.          The Court of Appeal took the view that on the facts, the husband’s statement and the interview records should have been disclosed earlier. I think the conclusion is one which most lawyers would agree with.
 
11.          I have consulted with the Attorney-General on the changes in prosecutorial practice arising from Kadar. The Attorney-General’s Chambers have taken into account the Kadar judgment when assessing the disclosure obligations in each case. The process begins early on at the pre-trial stage and continues until the conclusion of the case.
 
12.          Prosecutors have also been briefing investigators on the requirements laid down in Kadar. Investigators who are alive to the issues can effectively assist the Prosecution in fulfilling its disclosure obligations.
 
13.          Since the enactment of the CPC 2010, the Attorney-General’s Chambers have been working on a joint Code of Practice for prosecutors and defence counsel, which will carry general guidance on disclosure. At the same time, the criminal bar and prosecutors from the Attorney-General’s Chambers  have also engaged in discussion to work out guidelines on the Prosecution’s disclosure obligations under Kadar."

_______________________________________

There is no doubt that the issue of ministerial pay is an emotional one but in the midst of heated debate, it is still useful to reason with cool heads.

Firstly, not enough attention has been paid to the principle of “clean-wage”. This principle is not only at the heart of the Ee Report, it is also the premise on which the entire system of ministerial wages is based, from the beginning when Mr Lee Kuan Yew implemented it, right up till now.

The wage that office-holders in Singapore get is the totality of the remuneration they get – there are no hidden perks like hospitalization benefits, housing benefits, tax exemptions etc. With the exception of the President, the Prime Minister and the Speaker of Parliament, no office-holder or Member of Parliament is given a car for personal use. And even then, the use of the car is a taxable benefit, rather than a perk. This is exceptional compared to most countries, especially at the ministerial level.

This point cannot be emphasized enough. Much has been said online, in the local press and in the international press about our leaders being the best-paid. The benchmark for this is the salary, specifically the cash-component of an office holder’s income. This is not a fair comparison. The most quoted example one sees repeated ad nauseam is the President of the United States' salary of US$400,000. However this does not include all his other benefits which include free accommodation in the White House and use of its army of servants and staff, official transport and a whole range of other perks and non-cash benefits. It is also interesting to note that the reported salary of the President of China is US$11,000. Without being facetious, one wonders how such a salary could possibly allow him any respectable accommodation of any sort, even if he were to just rent in Beijing. It was also the ‘benefits’ part of remuneration that led to the scandal involving expense-claims, specifically housing claims, of the members of the UK Parliament.

The strength of our clean-wage system is also its weakness. The transparency of this system allows us to know exactly how much our political office holders get. However the difficulty is that we alone implement this system. When nobody else in the world has a clean-wage system, and all comparisons are made purely on cash-income, then our leaders will always look like the highest paid.

The crucial question then is whether it is foolhardy for the Singapore government to stand alone in a world where nobody else offers a clean-wage system. As an emotive issue, and with continual unfair comparisons being made purely on cash-income, a good system has become a public relations disaster. No amount of explanation will defuse the issue when the stark contrast keeps getting emphasized in salary league tables. The Singaporean voter could in the end be no different from and no less human than any voter or citizen anywhere else in the world, and a remuneration system with perks and benefits could prove more politically palatable than a clean-wage system.

Secondly, to poll the average man on the street on what he thinks of a million dollar salary is pointless. The problem is one of perspective and the perspective of the top income earners anywhere in the world is something no man on the street can empathize with; whatever method one uses to arrive at the pay is irrelevant, once that number is large enough.

To the average man, a pay cut of 1/3 from $1.5 million to $1 million still leaves an unfathomable sum. But the $500,000 difference could lead to a real impact on the standard of life as it could mean the difference of meeting that mortgage payment on one’s house. We cannot possibly expect our office-holders to sell their houses and downgrade in order to take up their appointment. By the time some of these potential office holders have reached their 40's , they have settled into a certain lifestyle that requires a certain income to upkeep. To expect these people to sell their houses, their cars, or to forgo their children's education overseas is just an idealism that bears no relation to reality. In the end, we will only end up like other countries where only people who are financially independent and secure will enter politics seriously.

Thirdly, while we appreciate and value the ethos of public service, it is unwise to over-play it. The generation of Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Keng Swee emerged in a time of chaos, revolution and change in a post-colonial world. Even then, it was pure luck that we got these people rather than the rapacious leaders that impoverished many countries that became independent the same time as Singapore.

We could thus pay low wages and hope that some able, altruistic men and women will step forward, or create a system that increases the chances that we will still get able leaders, altruistic or not. At the end of the day, we are not looking only for servants, but leaders with specific skill sets to govern our country, manage our economy and make policies that would affect our country’s future. Beyond a calling, there is thus also a job to be done, and in order to get people with the right technocratic skills to get this job done well, there is no shame in paying for it. We must not confuse political governance with charity work.

Finally, in the heated and emotional debate over ministerial salary, it is disappointing to see the often rude and offensive criticism of Minister of State Grace Fu on the Internet, in response to her honest reaction to the ministerial wage cuts. Respect may have to be earned, but surely civility does not."

Animal welfare: Response good so far, says Shanmugam

by Vimita Mohandas and Olivia Siong
04:47 AM Jan 03, 2012

SINGAPORE - One of the reasons for having several pilot animal welfare programmes in his constituency was to showcase the possibilities and, after six months, the response ""has been good so far"", Law and Foreign Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said yesterday.

More people are coming forward to help in these programmes on pet ownership and management of strays in Chong Pang.

And following its first public forum held in June last year, attended by animal welfare groups and more than 400 animal lovers, a second one is now being planned for the first half of this year.

Mr Shanmugam, a Member of Parliament for Nee Soon Group Representation Constituency, told reporters on the sidelines of a community event that the first forum was ""fairly substantial"".

""A lot of feedback has been taken up, and we've crystalised the issues. Some have been dealt with,"" he said and added that others are being looked into, while more will be discussed at the next forum.

The constituency has halted the culling of strays and since rolled out cat feeding stations for responsible ownership of community cats. A pilot project to allow registered cats in public flats is also in the mix.

And Mr Shanmugam believes that more can be done, with the combined effort of society, government and people. But even as Chong Pang is showing the possibilities for other constituencies, he acknowledged that there has been both positive and negative feedback.

""People are asking us, 'Why are you spending so much time with cats and dogs'. But it's not a zero-sum game. There are people who are interested in coming forward to help and we can work with them,"" he said.

""It doesn't mean it detracts us from doing other things. But we have to bear in mind that, in society, there are different interest groups, and animal lovers have said: 'Well you're not moving fast enough.' So we'll do the best that we can.""

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), for one, will be pushing this year for a law to ensure responsible pet ownership. This includes getting those under the age of 16 to obtain parental consent before they buy a pet.

This, as the Year of the Rabbit is about to end, and animal shelters having seen a 30-per-cent increase in the number of abandoned rabbits last year compared to 2010. The House Rabbit Society of Singapore, for instance, took in about 100 rabbits.

The SPCA takes in up to 600 unwanted or abandoned pets each month. Just on Christmas Eve, a Maltese dog was found abandoned in the SPCA's garden, one of many pets abandoned over the festive season. Another example was two cats found at a canal near the SPCA.

""Usually pet owners figure at (festive seasons) that they've had enough of the pet and they just want to get rid of the inconvenience,"" said SPCA executive director Corrine Fong.

The SPCA has also seen a 40-per-cent increase in the number of abandoned hamsters in the last six months. It says this is largely due to the easy availability of hamsters.

Besides ramping up its public education programmes, the SPCA wants pet shops to play a bigger role.

""Puppy mills need to microchip all their puppies and all their dogs, which they're not doing right now, and pet stores need to license their dogs at the point of sale, which many are also not doing,"" Ms Fong said.

""I'm hoping the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore will step up the pressure on them to do this, because under the pet shop licence conditions, pet stores must license their puppies at the point of sale.""

1.       What did SHT actually say ?
2.       Was the TOC article accurate ?
3.       Is SHT a racist ?
  
 
What did SHT say ?
 
1.       There has been a lot of response, to what people believe SHT said. That response is entirely understandable, if indeed he had said what has been attributed to him. Unfortunately, what has happened is that a significant part of what has been attributed to SHT is false. 

2.   	SHT heard over the radio what an officer from MRT had said – essentially suggesting that the poor language skills of Chinese, Indian and Malay drivers who worked with SMRT was part of the problem, in the inadequacy of the response. SHT disagreed with this comment. On TV he referred to this comment and in essence made the point that the language skills of workers should not be blamed and that broken English can be accepted (meaning that broken English would have sufficed for effective communication). The real problem, according to SHT, was that the drivers had not been given adequate training. The problem lay with management and not the workers. 

3.      This is what he said. The meaning is clear enough. The key point is that SHT referred to the MRT officer’s statement in order to rebut it, to say that he, SHT, disagreed with it.  

4.      The mistake SHT made was that he misquoted the MRT officer and said that the officer had referred to Indian and Malay drivers when in fact the officer had referred to drivers of all three races. SHT could also have explicitly disagreed with the view (which he thought that the MRT officer had expressed) that the Indian and Malay drivers had poorer language skills. SHT has since apologized for the error he made.
 
Was the TOC article accurate ?
 
5.    The TOC headlined its article : “ MP Seng Han Thong : SMRT’s unpreparedness also due to Malay and Indian staffs English language inefficiency”
6.     This is quite false. It attributes to SHT the very opposite of what SHT had said. The article does not say that SHT was quoting what an MRT officer had said, and the article does not say that SHT quoted it in order to disagree with it. Instead it says ( both in the headlines and in the text) that he in fact said the above.
 
Is SHT a racist ?
 
7.       My colleagues and I have known SHT for many years. He is not a racist. He works hard on the ground and helps everyone. It is quite unfair to label him as a racist. If he had indeed made the comments which have been attributed to him, then I would have come out to say that that is completely unacceptable.
 
Conclusion
 
I hope we can deal with this matter on the basis of facts and not on the basis of a false statement which has been quite wrongly attributed to SHT.”

AVA SUPPORTS REHOMING OF STRAY DOGS
Following reports of the recent case of a jogger who was scratched and bitten by a pack of stray dogs at Punggol Waterway, there are public concerns that all stray dogs that are rounded up are culled. The Agri-Food & VeterinaryAuthority (AVA) would like to clarify that AVA does not practice blanket culling.Instead, we allow stray dogs that are suitable for adoption to be re-homed.Those which cannot be re-homed will be humanely euthanized.

Re-homing of stray dogs
2 This year, 30 stray dogs have been re-homed. AVA will continue to
work closely with Animal Welfare Groups (AWGs) such as Action for Singapore Dogs (ASD) and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) tore-home suitable stray dogs.

3 Those who wish to re-home the dogs will have to bear the costs of
associated with re-homing. These will include licensing, microchipping, and boarding fees (amounting to approximately $150). The adopters must also sterilize the dogs and ensure that the dogs are kept at the licensed address and not be released back into the environment. Punitive action will be taken against adopters if these dogs are found straying again.

4 Ms Tan Poh Hong, Chief Executive Officer of AVA said, “We recognizethat there are animal lovers who are genuinely concerned about the welfare of stray dogs. Those who wish to re-home the stray dogs must be committed to providing them with a permanent home and caring for them responsibly.”

5 Sharing AVA CEO’s views on responsible dog ownership, Mr Ricky
Yeo, President of ASD commented, “We are heartened by AVA’s support of rehoming but we would like to emphasise that adoption is a lifetime commitment. Dogs that are adopted should not be released into the streets again.” SPCA’s Executive Director, Ms Corrine Fong, agrees, “The SPCA stands ready to work with AVA on re-homing adoptable stray dogs. Adopters must ensure that the re-homed dogs are licensed, sterilized, vaccinated and microchipped.”

Managing the stray dog population
6 Strays dogs can pose a threat to public safety especially when they are in a pack. They have been known to chase and even attack both people and animals. The recent Punggol Waterway incident is a case in point.

7 In addition, of greater concern is the possibility of stray dogs spreading rabies in the event of a rabies outbreak in Singapore. Rabies is a disease that can be fatal to both humans and animals. As dogs are highly susceptible to rabies, a large stray dog population can exacerbate the spread of rabies to other animals and humans if they are exposed and bitten by a rabies-infected animal. It is thus important to keep the stray dog population in check.

8 The management of stray animals is an emotive issue. On one hand,
we understand and share the concerns of animal lovers who seek to safeguard the welfare of stray animals in Singapore. On the other hand, we must also respect the interests of those who are bothered by stray animals, even though they may not hate animals or condone animal cruelty. Nevertheless, AVA has a duty above all to ensure public safety and public health of our people, even as we strive to do so in a measured and collaborative manner, working with various stakeholders in the community.

She writes  about the person who dumped a cat into a rubbish bin; and the need to treat pets as part of the family. She sets out some reasons why people abandon pets - for example, so that furniture will not be scratched and so on . Quite troubling. We need a lot more education on the responsibiites that come with ownership of pets; and people who dont want such responsibilites shold not own pets. Tabitha's article is very moving ( for me at elast), and referenced to the stories that we ahve all heard of the loyalties shown by pets. She says "" Animals have emotions too. They can feel, even if they cant talk, and they feel as much of an emotional attachemnt tot heir owners as family members do."". Well said."

Many things have been said about 9/11. If we want to find the meaning of what happened that day we could look into the eyes of the youngest victim – Christine Hanson. She was 2 yrs old, and died with her parents in one of the planes. She was being taken to Disneyland. She had a full life ahead of her. 
 
The people who took her life represent unadulterated, unvarnished, undiluted evil.  Those who stand by and support, and those who quietly approve or seek to justify such wanton murder,  are all also guilty, in various ways, of being associated with evil. No appeal to ideology or religion or rationale can justify what was done to Christine Hanson and nearly 3000 others like her.
 
In Singapore, all our religious leaders from the different faiths, as well Singaporeans generally, were unanimous in condemning the actions of the terrorists.
 
Our hearts went to the innocent victims and their loved ones, 10 yrs ago. Today, once again, we remember and send our thoughts to them and America."

They also shared with me several interesting insights:-
- some people adopt dogs without realising the level of commitment which might be needed. After a while, they abandon the dogs. These poor dogs then end up roaming the streets, often unable to fend for themselves;
- the HDB rules on the types of dogs that can be kept in flats may need to be relooked. HDB rules allow dogs to be kept in flats based on size. Thus Jack Russells qualify to be kept in our HDB flats. But Jack Russells of course are extremely active and need a lot of attention. So they are not easy to keep unless they are given a lot of attention and taken out for proper walks. If not given attention, they tend to make themselves heard very loudly! I was told that a lot of Jack Russells are adopted and then given up because people don't realise the level of responsibility needed.

I took some pictures of my dogs a couple of days ago, to share in this album."

203314719715066_217293408317197,"We had a fun-filled event organized for all the residents of blocks 112,113, 115, 116 and 120, Yishun Ring Road on Sunday 24th July 2011.

One of the highlights of the event, which was attended by more than 700 residents, young and old, was a dialogue session I had with the residents. They shared their views and opinions concerning themselves, their flats and neighbourhood.  They also provided feedback on local and national level issues including potential transportation fare hikes, job security, house prices and their affordability and foreign talent.  We had a good dialogue. I shared my thoughts and rationale behind some of the policies.  

I’m sharing some photos I took with the residents here.
