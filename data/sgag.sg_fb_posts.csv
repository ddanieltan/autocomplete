*UNDERGOING REMEDIAL ARCHITECTURE (URA)*. We need to *PAY AND PAY (PAP)*. Not only do we have to pay and pay, we  *PAY UNTIL BROKE (PUB)*. Our roads are managed by people who *PURPOSELY WANT to DIG (PWD)*. 

To own a car, we need to 
*CUT ON ENTERTAINMENT (COE)*. Driving on our roads, we can't afford the *EXPENSIVE ROAD POLICY (ERP)*. The expressway is 
 *CONGESTED THROUGHOUT EVERYDAY (CTE)* If you don't own a car, you need to take the *MAD RUSH TRANSPORT (MRT)*, OR take a *SLOW BUS SERVICE (SBS)* which is run by those who require us *NOT TO USE CASH (NTUC)*. Luckily, despite the frequent rail breakdowns, they have the *LET'S TRY AGAIN (LTA)* spirit.  Not to worry in the end, we have  *CASH PROVIDED FUNERAL (CPF)* to leave this world with dignity.

This is the life of a normal *Singaporean!*

378167172198277_1285774081447376,"Hi everyone,

I just want to share my thoughts while playing pokemon go.

 I know sometimes we are fretting over a snorlax or dragonite that ran away from us. Or a chansey and porygon that was sighted but we cant get in time to see it.

In the game of pokemon go, i have seen people of all ages old or young, girl or boy all actively walking around singapore; people jumping and running everytime a rare pokemon appears. I have seen passion, dedication and warmth where old couples walking in park hand in hand catching pokemon together.

But this game also makes me more aware of my surrounding. Everytime a rare pokemon appears, hordes and hordes of people will be running around. And sometimes there will be people who didnt join in the action. I started to look around and wonder why didnt they join in the action. Some of them have the pokemon go app running on the phone but didnt bother running after the rare pokemon.

And once i decided to ask a lady.
Me : Hey! You know a snorlax just appear there right?
Lady : Yay haha! I heard a few people shouting snorlax too haha.
Me :  You already got one? So you dont feel like running for it?
Lady : Nope i dont have one... and i wish i can have it too but i cant.
Me : Oh... may i ask why you can't?
Lady : Ah because i have a heart condition and i cant really run... 
Me : Oh i see... it's okay i believe one day snorlax will stop you while you are walking. Until then, hope you are enjoying the game=)
Lady : Ah that's nice of you... thanks! You not getting the snorlax?
Me : Nope haha. I have enough fun for today and hope you enjoyed today too=)

Through this encounter with the lady, i realised pokemon go has made me learn much more than catching rare pokemons. It makes me appreciate the fact that i can run and i am healthy. And care for the people around me with certain obstacles to overcome in life.

Recently a friend also shared a link with me about a girl. She has a certain condition and her family is raising funds for her so that she can have an operation done overseas so that she can live her life freely again and getting back to school. 

Sometimes a simple dream like going back to school can be hard to achieve too due to some obstacles in life. Let's spread the love and make this world more beautiful. Let's catch the beautiful dreams of people and help them fulfil their dreams! Gonna catch' em all!

Here is a brief description about the girl my friend told me about.

Her name is Liang le. She has a rare medical condition where she has extra weak blood vessels in her spinal cord. This condition has effect ranging from headaches, numbness to coma and paralysis.

Credit to Amber Pek, who recounted the full story: 

< So today is my first time riding with Uber and I witness a LTA officer beating up the Uber cab uncle. I'm sharing this as I felt this was an abuse of power from the LTA officer. His actions were absolutely outrageous and unacceptable. Using violence on an old uncle and kicking him even when he's on the ground. 

I called for a Uber car to pick me up at bugis junction Victoria street taxi stand. I did not know only taxis were allowed to turn in. However when I was waiting for my Uber car to arrive, I saw this LTA officer standing at the turning in point, scolding and chasing cars away. He was not friendly at all and was shouting at the cars in a rude manner. Naturally I quickly went to the entry point when my uber car came and told the officer I called for this uber cab ride and that he's just turning in to pick me up like normal on call cabs.

The LTA officer then proceeded to scold the uber driver in a rude way saying he's gonna give him a warning and why can't he read only taxi is allowed to enter? 

Uber driver to officer: "" My passenger requested for pick up at the taxi stand. What should i do?""
Lta to uber :""tell ur passenger to go to the other side! Can't your passenger walk?! You wanna talk back now? I warning you and you want to talk back?! I'm gonna report you!"" (Yes he was shouting)

LTA officer then begun to block the car taking photos. The uber driver drove in the taxi stand, got down the car and gave the LTA officer his NRIC telling him just take down his details. The officer then continued shouting and said the uncle was harassing him. The uncle got back in the car and the LTA officer started to gesture big actions and started taking photos again. The uber uncle got down again and asked again if he wants all his details. The lta officer begin to become aggressive, shouting hokkien vulgarities saying he don't mind losing his job. Then he threw the first punch at the Uber uncle. You guys can see the rest from the video that both times the LTA officer threw the first punch and proceeded to kick the old uncle when he fell to the ground. 

Despite all these and his bleeding injuries, the uber uncle told me ""xiao mei it's ok let's go uncle send you. Uncle old already aiyo my teeth dropped out."" I felt so pained seeing his face filled with blood. I kept apologizing as I didn't know cars were not allowed. He just assured me it's okay and told me not to worry. I gave him my contact and would like to thank him for sending me to my destination safely. I'm currently in contact with his son should he need further assistance because they are at TTSH at the moment... >"

378167172198277_1232608176754168,"Hello fellow Singaporeans. I am here to share my two cents of thoughts regarding the recent implemented Baby Bonus Scheme.

Recently, this policy was introduced by the government to give newborn baby cash incentives which sums up to 8 to 10 thousands for each and subsequent newborn. I would like to ask what contributions have the babies done for Singapore to deserve the money? Furthermore, we do not know whether these individuals would stay in Singapore to help develop or contribute to the society.

And what about the young adults who will contribute to Singapore in the near future? They are unable to receive support from the government in terms of monetary aspects unless they bear children. How is this reasonable? And to us, the working adults who contributed to the society for years, these new policies of housing and the baby issues clearly do not include our share. Is this fair?

What rights do the newborns have, to take the taxpayers' money just because they are born in this year? 
Pardon my poor English, thank you for taking time to read my post.

我有话题要讨论，政府现在的政策如婴儿发红我十分不解，一个出生婴儿对新加坡没有任何贡献，将来也不知道是否会留在新加坡发展，政府就给了8千，10千，那些中青年，正要为新家坡做贡献了，正要接班努力工作的，却得不到政府的任何支援，唯有你有要生子，才能分享那所谓的奖励，而我们这些为国家努力了三十多年的中年人，买屋津贴我们没份，生孩子津贴也没份，这实在有欠公平。请问出生的婴儿有什么资格拿纳锐人的钱，只因他们是在这个时候出世的？"

My request is simple. Receipt and payment slip can prove the transaction. There are still seats available. All my friend wanted is a confirmed seat, while Jetstar can take time to sort out the erroneous by 7-11 staff. 

Jetstar reply : ""I'm afraid this is not something we can assist with as it is not system error at our end"".

Wow!! Money goes into their pocket and just say not their fault to taichi it away. I bet Jetstar will taichi regular customer like me away also! Somemore say get finance to retrieve the payment and refund my friend!

That I wasn't one bit angry? That I am tired and have been out since morning and needed sleep so badly. That my injuries and my surgery hasn't healed. That squeezing on the buses and all didn't make me upset.

No, I merely marvelled at how the bus drivers, with some complaints no doubt, came back to work nevertheless. Sure they would be paid 1.5x more or some form of compensation worked out for them. But those who were supposed to knock off continued to work anyway. Just to send equally tired people home. 

I think the real heroes tonight, apart from the frantic SMRT engineers, are the bus drivers, and other Singaporeans lending a hand to send people home."

One life lost is one too many. Let's come together to lend those affected, all the support they need.

We'll also like to express our appreciation and gratitude to the Sabahan climbing guides, rangers, rescue and recovery teams for their tireless efforts in helping those affected up on the mountain. Thank you.

As for those keyboard warriors who are questioning the school and teachers' decision to send ""kids below the age of 12"" up on the ""tallest mountain in Malaysia"" given the ""risk of unforeseen circumstances like an earthquake occurring"" , I've got something for you:

If you've nothing better to say, don't say.

What was initially a one-day ""black out"" on SGAG as a mark of respect for the passing of LKY was extended to the full seven days because we just felt it wasn't right to be laughing during this period of mourning.

While it still feels weird to be joking after an emotionally intense week, the late LKY would have wanted not just SGAG, but all Singaporeans to move on from the mourning, and continue making positive differences in people's lives, like how he did in ours.

So come Monday tomorrow, all of us at #SGAGhq will be ready to rock and roll to entertain all you Singaporeans once again! 

Goodnight Singapore,
Goodnight Lee Kuan Yew."

I used to wonder why Mr Lee Kuan Yew teared when Malaysia and Singapore parted ways. I mean come on, just look at how well Singapore is doing without Malaysia. With it's superb geographical advantage, Singapore can easily prosper on its own, right?

With the recent surge of LKY related videos, I suddenly came to realize how much I have taken for granted. Singapore is where she is today not because she is destined to be successful, in fact, she is by right destined to be crushed by obstacles every step of the way. But one man had a dream, and had the fighting spirit to go against anything to ensure her survival. Because of him, she not only stood the test of the time, but also became one of the greatest countries on the globe.

Thank you Mr Lee for the opportunities that came my way because of the meritocratic system that you have developed. Thank you Mr Lee for the convenient and comfortable life style that I get to enjoy because of your foresight in building the island. Thank you Mr Lee for making Singapore happen.

This song is dedicated to the man who made the impossible happen."

We are group of local artists and, while we recognize the solemness of Mr Lee's passing, we are tired of the negativity surround this historical event.

The fact is, Mr Lee had led a fulfilling life. He studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, fell in love, brought up three beautiful children and accomplished what most people can only dream of accomplishing. He defined greatness. There isn't much left for him in our world.

We hope this short write-up would be comforting to those who are still in grief and that the caricature will remind Singaporeans that Mr and Mrs Lee are now reunited in a better place. A place void of pain and dread.

As much as we can't imagine a Singapore without LKY and would love to see him at Padang witnessing the celebration of Singapore's 50th birthday, we all know deep down that it is just a matter of time now, and it doesn't look like time is in his favour.

Singapore is considering banning energy drinks island wide from 1 April onwards. Mr Lim Hong Niu, a representative stated that the main reason for banning energy drinks is substantiated by multi-billion dollars research, that is aimed at encouraging Singaporeans ""to look within themselves and be self driven/motivated, and not rely on external pretentious sweet energy drinks”.
 
Mr Lim Hong Niu told our reporter that Singaporeans are very supportive of this move with “9 out of 10 Singaporeans surveyed indicating that they support banning energy drinks in the country.""
 
Other Singaporeans said that banning everything that can be banned in Singapore is the best way forward as we do not know what is best for ourselves and it is better to let the highly paid authorities decide what we should with our lives.
 
Before the interview ended, Mr Lim Hong Niu was seen passing a $100 supermarket voucher to a member of the public who just completed another survey titled “Should Singapore ban cigarettes?”"

Girl and boy have ""chemistry"" while dancing but girl has no special interest in boy.
Boy asks girl out on Halloween, girl says ok, they met, had a little drink and chit chatted for 3 hours at Clarke Quay.
Boy hugs girl at the end of the night, girl gets angry, pushes boy away.
While quarrelling at the MRT station, girl says to boy ""I'm not that kinda easy girl ok?""
Boy doesn't talk to girl for 2 weeks, girl asks boy out to ""talk things out""
Girl and boy talk for one hour, boy kisses girl, girl didn't reject him this time.
The day after kiss, boy disappears again, message him he reply 12 hours later, girl feels hurt cause she starting to like him.
When they finally met again, boy tells girl that the kiss was nothing much, no emotions involved.
Now rumour in school is that she chased him, he dumped her.

What's the moral of this story? Maybe talk softer so that limpeh cannot eavesdrop?

The terrorists themselves would have to excuse-me-excuse-me, in order to go from point A to point B.

Before, they reach there, some PRC will get into an argument with them.

By the time they reach point B. Security and police is already there.

If they escape somehow, public transport will break down.

If they go north, the bangla will find them.
If they go south, the bangla will find them.
If they go east, the bangla will find them.
If they go west, the bangla will find them.

If they survive somehow, they will slip on a banana skin, fall on their head and die. Else, they will get knocked down by a vehicle driven by a PRC. Then their guts will come out. Their brains will splatter. Their testicles will ooze out. And their limbs dismembered.

If their attack is successful, people will stomp. And they will get caught. If they're not caught, they will die.

If nothing bad happens to them, they will end up in another crowded place and will need to excuse-me-excuse-me all over again.

Repeat."

How can I avoid my ex boyfriend when he keeps calling me (even I had blocked all his numbers and he still calls me thru public phones/ common friends phone)?”

XiaoDong’s Reply
“The next time he calls, tell him that you are pregnant but not sure who’s the father of the baby. If he dares to take responsibility of the baby then he quite steady pompipi and you can reconsider him again. If not, he probably won’t call you for 9months but if he REALLY calls again, Buy 30 You Don’t Chi Bai Tshirts from us and we’ll mail one to him everyday""

TRANSLATION:
“One turns 30 in the blink of an eye. One has to get married, buy a house, and have children. This isn’t possible without money. Nowadays, a flat these costs $300,000 to $400,000. If you work in the CBD, your expenses will tally up to $5 or $6, that is, if you scrimp and save. If I want to listen to the government and have children, I’ll need to get a girlfriend. If I have no money, how will I woo a girl? Dates and holidays together cost money. Without cash, no one would date me, even if I look like a superstar.

Some people want to remain in university and not work. But who will manage family expenses and the mortgage? A wedding table at a banquet costs at least $1,000, and a photoshoot costs $3,000-$4,000.

Everything costs money!

Our generation doesn’t want a higher quality of life. We only want to maintain our standard of living. In order to do this, we need to make money! You don’t want a son who has to rely on you to set up a home, right?

378167172198277_1029042033777451,"What car owners would like non car owners to know:

We are not obliged to send you anywhere, it's out of goodwill when we do. So don't complain about it and say behind our backs. You are not the one paying the erp, parking, petrol, installments and maintenance so stfu. Be appreciative. If your friends start to not sending u back or what like the past, reflect on yourself. Have you ever appreciated? Tried to like offer to top up petrol, Cashcard or chip in abit even treating a meal or what? It's not about being stingy. But about appreciating. Even a cup of soft drink/ ice kachang would do. Please la, take taxi also how much le. No one likes to do things and end up feeling there for a use.

Stop complaining and whining. It's our car, we have pride in it. When you were having fun, we work hard for it. Having a car is easy, maintaining it is hard. It's our pride. P.s: I may not own a big car, but I slog hard for it.

Where we feel like parking is our problem. We may park a distance and walk across sometimes, not because we can't afford it, but we don't feel like paying to the money eating gantries can? Unless we are feeling lazy, and furthermore, you are not paying for it so shut up.

What time we want to head into town is for us to decide, if you think you want to head in earlier or later, go yourself la! Like I said, not cannot afford. But don't want let the gov earn even more can. Before 12 or after 8 only UNLESS I FEEL LIKE IT CAUSE IM THE DRIVER. You don't know how it feels like to top up your Cashcard every 2 days and it will never be enough.

Don't slam our door. It's our car, Because why? We pay for the repairs. You don't. It's our baby. You won't like people to give your baby a slap would you? Who do we find when our lock spoil because of your slamming and the mechanism malfunction and then tell you, you would say 'how can that be, I not very hard what.' Or 'I only did it once' or 'sorry' and then WE had to pay for the repairs ourself because of you people. Be considerate.

It's our car, whatever color or modifications we do to it, WE LIKE IT, END OF STORY. No need for your comments. If you got so much comments or opinions, get your own car and do on your car.

**no hard feelings, no direct to anyone, just seen myself and ALOT of car friends having this issue over the few years of driving. Just that it definitely doesn't feel good to be used as an chauffeur**

P.s: having a friend who has a car doesn't make him/her your Ahmad (unless your partner), but learn to appreciate. Be thankful for it.

Although she may looked fierce, she is actually a friendly person who knows many of the customers who went to Singpost. Today she was shorthanded by 2 staff and she had to mend the booth herself. 

Despite all the buzz and fuss and our many many Tshirts, she did not stop smiling and try her best to help us and work together to ensure all the registered stamps are pasted. She even had to apologize to the long queue because we had ""hogged"" the lane due to our huge Qty. 

To Mdm Diljit and her team in Bedok Central Singpost, you are AWESOME!

He didn't mean the word 'single' to sound that way it sounded to some people but you guys simply brought it out of context and made him sound like a playboy. 

Honestly speaking, when you're 15 - 16, do you have that much wisdom to talk abt 20 meaningful facts about yourself when the only things most of us are exposed to at that age are just sch, CCA, family, movies etc? 

This is a learning point for all, before picking on someone else's social media post. I hope the admins don't take my post here into offense. I still love your posts and 'like' them from time to time."

4D is a local lottery which picks out 4 random digits as a bi-weekly draw. People are always on a lookout for potential winning combinations."

Gone are the days when teachers can:

A) throw remnants of chalk across the classroom that will directly hit a student's face

B) the blackboard duster if option A doesn't work

C) twist the ears of the student for added reiteration

D) ask the student to stand on the chair

E) ask the student to stand on the chair...while carrying their school bags above their heads

F) practice our drumming skills on a student's hand with a ruler

...and many more. Ah the good old times. What other corporal punishments can you share with us! Comment away.

Being an educator is not an easy task, especially now. Now, you shout at the kids, tomorrow parents come, complain!

So thank you teachers for always telling youself to calm the s**t down before you end up slapping a kid across the face, and that too on a daily basis. Haha."

We have received feedback about you barking nonsense in the middle of the night (See here: http://on.fb.me/1tXMSZL)

We wish to remind all stupid people to take proper care of what comes out of their mouths and ensure that they do not cause stupidity to spread by barking nonsense incessantly.

A stupid person barking excessively can become a nuisance to Singaporeans. It could seriously disturb their sleep or affect their work or study. It is your responsibility to ensure that stupid people like you do not disturb others. If you are unable to control your stupidity from talking out loud, you can consider the following measures: 

1. Take a walk along Bedok Reservoir and consider walking into it;
2. Ask someone to slap you every time you talk too much and modify your behaviour;
3. Remove your brain through surgery (Oh wait you don't have one! Sorry for being insensitive) How about removing your voice box through surgery then?

We can help make our neighbourhood a less stupid place for everyone to live in.

Yours Sin-BLOODY-cerely,
Dogs
Dog-Lovers

ACS(I): They raise money from their very rich Parents Support Group to charter 5 MRT trains

SAINT ANDREW'S: They charter buses and pray that the MRT trains transporting the ACS(I) students breakdowns

RI: They form 4 committees with RGS. One to look into existing transportation methods, one to explore new methods, one to prototype and test, and one to market it

HCI: They come out with the Chinese version of what RI/RGS comes out with

VS: How they go to the sports meet doesn't matter as long as they cheer their way there, with flags and banners of course! (Cre: ShuKai Hu)

MGS: They will hitch a ride on the MRT trains with their boyfriends from ACS(I)

RIVER VALLEY HIGH: The chartered bus uncle sent the students to SGH cause he thought they all nurses

NUS High School of Math and Science: There is no need to travel to the meet. The science department will get a direct link telecasting the match to all the students' computers in school. Their math department will compute their probability to win before starting the hijacked transmission (Cre: Papa Rich Wee)

Maris Stella High: Will not go, they are still waiting for the swimming pool their former principal promised them for decades (Cre: Gordon Teo)

More about ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)

http://www.nni.com.sg/patients/pt-education-resources/patient-support/Pages/mnd-patient-support-group.aspx

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)—also referred to as motor neurone disease (MND), Charcot disease, and, in the United States, Lou Gehrig's disease—is a neurodegenerative disease with various causes. It is characterised by muscle spasticity, rapidly progressive weakness due to muscle atrophy, difficulty in speaking (dysarthria), swallowing (dysphagia), and breathing (dyspnea). ALS is the most common of the five motor neuron diseases.

Like many non-Marvel fans, I went into the cinema with very low expectations of GOTG because the advertised characters do look quite lame and the cast doesn't really excite me much (chiobu don't have, yandao also don't really have). But holyshit! It was one of the best Marvel movies I've ever watched! I'm not going to be a spoiler by revealing too much of the story but I had a GROOT laugh and it was really entertaining.

Oh and the Vin Diesel really win liao lor! He get paid so much just to repeat the same line throughout the entire movie! I AM GROOT!! Next time got this kinda job lobang please jio me also! Easy peasy money!

He asked the monk what was the significance of the two. The monk explained that in the Chinese system of yin and yang, positives must always be balanced by negatives, and having the two statues ensures that the universal balance was maintained.
""This statue of the woman is the Goddess of Mercy, Kuan-Yin.""
""What about the other one?"" asked the tourist.
""This one is the God of No Mercy, Kuan-Yew."" 

That not the end of the story, one day, Buddha sent Monkey God to fight a demon King, which end up with the Monkey God running for his life. The monkey God again ask Kuan Yin for help, Kuan Yin was having her period and told Monkey God to get Kuan Yew to help. 

Monkey God was delighted to see Kuan Yew looking fierce and merciless, thinking the demon king is gonna to get a real beating. Kuan Yew look at Monkey God and said, ""I cannot help you"" 
Monkey God ""Why? Buddha say can find you""

378167172198277_997343463613975,"A gentle reminder as we turn 49 

The majority of us live in ""Highly Dangerous Buildings"" (HDB).

Most people have  already got used to ""Paying and Paying"" (PAP). 

Not only do you have to pay, you ""Pay Until Bankrupt"" (PUB).  

If that's not enough, somebody still ""Purposely Wants to Dig"" (PWD) and get more from you.

So what more can you do when you are in the ""Money Only Environment"" (MOE)? 

With the current ""Mad Accounting System"" (MAS), you are forced to ""Pay Sum Ahead"" (PSA), which will leave some  people ""Permanently Owing Some Banks"" (POSB), and forced to live on the ""Low Technology Always"" (LTA) system.

When you fall sick and happen to be admitted to a ""Money Operating Hospital"" (MOH), you might be able to use your ""Cash Prior to Funeral"" (CPF) fund. 

If you are out of luck, you may meet doctors who ""Never Use their Heart"" (NUH) to treat you, and you will  ""Sure to Give up Hope"" (SGH). 

To help ease the traffic, motorists have to pay ""Cash On Expressway"" (COE). 

If that doesn't help, they can always ""Eternally Raise Prices"" (ERP) on the roads.. 

If you don't own a car, you can always make a ""Mad Rush Train"" (MRT), OR get squashed in a bus ""So Bloody Small"" (SBS ). 

Lastly, under all these pressures, there are not many places we can relax, even the good old place we used to go, because it has become ""So Expensive & Nothing To See Actually"" (SENTOSA).

""Happy 49th Birthday Singapore - Our Home Our Country."""

378167172198277_996694200345568,"Dear Naomi Neo, I'm not here to ""hate"" on you, nor am I here to ""hurt you with some mindless, crude remarks or impudent behaviour"". I'm just here to share some thoughts of mine. 

Some background to the story. About a week ago, many people spotted a Photoshop fail on one of Naomi's Insta photo (http://instagram.com/p/q8vHZINPgA) and she reacted strongly yesterday with another post (http://instagram.com/p/rTrHKqtPm0)

YOU SAID:
<<I don't know how is it called ""exposing"" when I've already admitted it on my blog COUNTLESS times that I do edit my photos. What's wrong with wanting to look good or better? It has nothing gotta do with my self esteem issues, more like it's normal to just wanna look better>>

Yes it is true, there is nothing wrong with wanting to ""look good or better"". Even David Beckham, one of the most handsome living thing on this planet yearns to look like Xiao Ming one day (I told him to wait long long). In fact, it is a very normal expectation to have as human beings, to want to look and feel better.

However in the bid to ""look good or better"", there is a huge difference between editing your photos using basic Instagram-like functions (filters, brightness, contrasts and etc) which everyone does I'm sure, and Photoshop-ping a part of your body by distorting the natural shape of it, which is what you've probably done. 

So if you're actually doing the latter, contrary to what you strongly believe, you DO have some self esteem issues Naomi. No one with enough self esteem would resort to that level of Photoshop just to ""look good or better"". #JustSaying

YOU ALSO SAID:
<<This post isn't exactly to show how much I care about my haters, but more about how this has made me think a lot on how inhumane people have become; pissed that cyber bullying is encouraged over the recent years as a whole, not just about me alone. How people comment anonymously (or not) on young girls' accounts, saying they're too fat, ugly, too thin, whatsoever. It's saddening.>>

Have you ever thought that by intentionally distorting your body shape using a software, you're indirectly contributing to cyber bullying? You're putting up an image of yourself that isn't really the real you. Aren't you then, setting an unrealistic and false expectations of people on themselves and on others, which on certain case, leads to cyber bullying?

FINALLY YOU SAID:
<<Enough of telling yourself you're not good enough based on the standards that society has come up with. They are not standards, they are just unrealistic expectations. Now, stop>>

If what you're telling people is that they should be comfortable with themselves and not be influenced by society and it's ""unrealistic expectations"", aren't you already contradicting yourself by what you did? The last I remember, Photoshop-ping of body for magazine spreads and advertisements is a relatively common thing in Hollywood/Western culture so who's living under ""unrealistic expectations of the society"" now?

You're someone with great influence and following, no doubt about that. However, many of your followers are young girls who are growing up, finding out about their bodies, and trying to feel comfortable with them. Are you telling them that it is okay to digitally distort their bodies just to look ""good/better"" on social media? Don't you think you're sending them the wrong message with the seemingly flawed argument of yours? 

Cliche as it may sound, like what Uncle Ben once said, ""With great power comes great responsibilities"". You've an incredible number of followers (I also want), please do not teach them the wrong things. 

On a side note Naomi, if you teach me how to take photos of side-boobs, I'll teach you Photoshop. Steady? #ForReal #JiangZhenDe #IComeInPeace #PrayForBeckham"

Their story: Here's one of the image photographed by Raymond Phang for Kok Meng & Si Ying's bridal pre-wedding photoshoot at the NDP (National Day Parade) rehearsal!!!

This image may look simple, but then again unless you're the couple or their friends, you wouldn't know what they went through to get permit & security clearance for us to have the shoot done during one of the NDP Rehearsal.

Of course before the shoot, we had to attend one of the rehearsal (the first one infact and it was really, really good to the point that we didn't even know it's the first rehearsal). We sat through the whole parade from beginning to the end, and took effort to jot down every timing of each event and made important highlights on the parts where Raymond wanted to shoot - eg the National Flag fly past and some other segments. Raymond also took some recce shots of the places where he wanted to shoot so that Kok Meng can check with the higher authorities. 

It was quite an emotional roller coaster ride for all of us in the midst of obtaining clearance, cos most of the time it was a No-go for the spots where Raymond wanted to photograph. He's someone who really hates to settle for second best when he knows there's actually something better out there for the couple. 

Storms after storms came when the second choice spot was also met with a No go, but fortunately Kok Meng managed to push through and Raymond get to photograph at his first choice spot (of course still working within the security constrains).

It was a mad rush during the shoot (have to meet a lot of crucial timings else we'll miss them totally) literally running from location to location, but it was all so worth it to see this beautiful image and the smiles on the couple's faces. 

For every photoshoot that we've done, there's always a lesson to learn. Life is never an easy journey, and most of the time you can't have things your way. But as long as we have our beloved family and friends there to support us, we will pull through! And always remember, after the rain comes the sunshine... and sometimes rainbow too!! 

Special thanks to all of the officers who so kindly guided and helped for the shoot, Aloysius for being so on the ball and attentive to our needs. He actually made sure all of us have water to drink, food to eat and stuffs even during our first recce!!

Michael Chan for helping out (he helped carried a lot of heavy items for us despite having some back problem), Sulin and Angeline for assisting as well!

Also it's a tad early, but we'd just like to say..... Happy 49th Birthday, Singapore!!! 

Huat ah!!!!"

Before you Zouk-keepers start raging and puking all over me after drinking over-priced Waterfalls and Flaming Lambos, calm your tits down and listen. 

URA also not saying Zouk cannot operate anymore, they just saying:
""Excuse me Zouk, ITZLIDDAT.. You sitting on land which can add millions to our national reserves which affects our civil servant bonuses, so can you please sit your drunk ass somewhere else, thanks very much!""

If you think it is still a profitable business and that you've a huge loyal fan base, so what if URA wants to take back? JUST SHIFT LA! Why need to #SaveZouk here, #SaveZoo there? 

It's not like Zouk doesn't have the money to shift to a new place given how much they earn from countless generations of XMM and botak heads right? (Confession: I was one of them)

Nani oh Nani! You got chance you pass the ball to Nani (哪里)? Pass to Ronaldo please! Don't act yi ge like you can shoot on target!

Overheard that Ronaldo will be bringing two KFC Double Down burgers after half time. One for him, one for Neuer, sit down at his goal post eat burger. Nothing much to do anyway.

As for the Portugal goalkeeper, confirm plus chop kelong! Start only pass the ball to German player when under no pressure! If that one goal confirm kena hamtum!

Oh and that freaking camera shadow moving around the field is bloody distracting. One more time I see that limpeh send F16 go shoot down that stupid thing. Don't try me!

Doesn't matter that the SGAG Army was depleted in numbers on Twitter. Doesn't matter that ""5,000 retweets"" was something that we've never accomplished before, not even close. Doesn't matter that the odds were against our favour. 

What matters was when when the challenge was issued by Resorts World at Sentosa and FlyScoot, the SGAG Army rose to the challenge once again, and crushed it in less than 3 freaking hours! You guys should be damn proud of yourselves for yet another crazy ass achievement!

We've strength in numbers but what sets us apart is our unity, the will to fight together for a common goal. I've said it before and I'll say it again, this victory is yours my dear SGAG Army!

While I look for new battlegrounds to conquer, it is time to share the fruits of our labour once again. Check back on SGAG at 10am tomorrow (Saturday) and make sure you've your loved ones by your side for our challenge to win the prizes. Till the next time...

For all the rest of you guys who participated but didn’t win, thank you so much for your submissions. If we could give all of you a pair of air tickets, we would, but SGAG doesn’t own an airline like FlyScoot unfortunately. We really had a good time looking through the lovely submissions!

We had to reject some quality submissions because it didn’t fit the “selfie with father” theme while some others didn’t use a paper signage to display #ProudToBeInSGAGArmy. Next time wanna win prize must read the instructions properly ah!

I would also like to give a special shoutout to those who couldn’t take part because their dad isn’t around anymore. Apologies if this contest might have been a little insensitive towards you, that was never our intention. All we wanted to was to share the love of the “free” air tickets, as well as to celebrate the upcoming Father’s Day. That said, please be strong, cause I’m sure your dad is watching over, and protecting you from up there :)

Last but not least to the SGAG Army, you guys rock my socks (as well as my underwear)! Keep the troll alive, and long live our legacy!

As promised by Commander Xiao Ming, it's time to share the FlyScoot loot with the amazing SGAG Army! The contest mechanism is created with the upcoming Father's Day in mind and this is how it works:

1) Take a selfie with your dad with the most garang/fiercest expression

2) In the selfie, you MUST hold up a paper signage with the words #ProudToBeInSGAGArmy

3) Post the selfie as a photo comment in this status (not anywhere else)

4) Contest will end exactly 2 hours from now at 12 midnight. We will then unpublish the SGAG page to record the results 

5) 20 selfies with the most ""Like"" will win a pair of ScootBiz tickets each

6) Winners will be announced on SGAG Facebook and the redemption details will be provided over Facebook private message

Looking forward to seeing some awesome selfies! And remember, no fighting amongst ourselves ok? GO GO GO!

Where there is unity, there is always victory.
Remember the name, remember the SGAG Army."

""It takes an idea to create a revolution, but an army to make it happen""

Today, history has been created on our sunny island of Singapore. What started out as a little troll on FlyScoot quickly escalated to a 10k challenge that looks like too tall a mountain to climb.

But the SGAG Army is feared for a reason and within a short span of 14 hours, we've overcame the odds and accomplished something that no one in Singapore has ever done before on Facebook: 
Get 10,000+ likes on a Facebook comment.

A leader is nothing without soldiers who are willing to fight for him. I could have planned the most flawless strategy but it is only with each and everyone of your effort that we could make it happen, and you guys really made it happen so all of you should be damn proud of yourselves!

We've won the war (20 pairs of ScootBiz tickets) and now it is time to share the spoils. I've decided that ALL 20 pairs of tickets will be given to the SGAG Army because really, you guys deserve this more than I do. 

So at 10pm sharp tonight, we'll reveal how you can win these tickets and just a small little hint for all of you, it has gotta do with the upcoming Laopeh's Day (Father's Day). That's all I have to say for now, but till the next time...

Where there is unity, there is always victory.
Remember the name, remember the SGAG Army.

When Fan Bing Bing came to Singapore for the whatever X-Men premier, I thought she some big star in the movie sial. Come here wave and smile, press conference and all. I think Mr Singapore KFC Man (you know who I'm talking about) and Fan Bing Bing will make best buddies given how they are just useless figureheads that are being paid millions to do practically nothing in their roles. But then again, Fan Bing Bing probably is an icon used to increase ticket sales in the Chinese markets, I don't know what good Mr Singapore KFC man does at all. 

And talking about the sneak trailer after the end credits! WAH PIANG EH! You make me wait so long just to see something that has no head no tail? I swear I heard at least a dozen people in the cinema go HUH SIMI LANJIAO? Fewlings cheated max! 

All in all, the movie not bad la. Magneto should have come Singapore instead, can ask him help destroy all the metal monsters that sucks our money called ERP. But oh well...

Yes, if you've received a random lollipop/London ChocoRoll with a special handwritten note these two days, it is part of the #loveothers14 to spread a simple, yet powerful message.

Ironic as it might seem, I hope the people at STOMP too got a taste of this movement in one way or another. Why? Because what better way to spread this message than to love the enemy right?

As for those skeptics who wants to kaopeh and play the religion card, type out your comments in Microsoft Word, print it out, crush it into a ball, and stuff it in your candy ass. (The Rock would approve of this I'm sure)

Anyway keep spreading the love people! On a side note, I hope the #loveothers14 movement will upgrade to give Bedok 85 bak chor mee soon cause I'm craving for some of that now. Kthxbye!"

378167172198277_849427961738860,"This bus driver by the name of, Mr Sng, made my night yesterday.
It was around 9.45PM when I boarded the bus 75 from NgeeAnn Polytechnic's bus-stop. I was exhausted due to my training and couldn't wait to hop onto the bus to take a nap. However as I tapped my ezlink card, I couldn't help but noticed a box just beside the driver with a note that wrote,""Please help yourself to some candy and may you have a 'Sweet' journey ahead!"" I smiled and proceeded to take a seat without taking the sweets. 30 mins ride home felt short as I observed how the commuters boarded the bus, but I was shocked as I saw all 26 passengers that boarded the bus walked on without even taking a glimpse at the box of sweets. When the bus was arriving my stop, I grabbed my bag and went up to him, started a quick conversation while the bus stopped. I could tell by his face that he was disheartened that people simply walked by. Before I left the bus, I took a quick snap as he smiled, grabbed a sweet and left the bus. I realised that everyone was staring at me but I felt good. At least, I know that I've made someone's night.
Just a story that I wanna share out! Have a great day ahead everyone!

During restoration, a layer of white primer is first applied to the statues before fresh colors are painted on. The white primer allows the new coat of paint to appear richer in tones and enables better adherence to the existing surface. The restoration of a diorama such as the one pictured here can take up to six months. Rain or shine, a crew of two to three artisans work tirelessly to complete the task.

The state of whiteness evokes a sense of anticipation of a new chapter for Haw Par Villa, observing the statues without their usual hues, it is tempting to project our own imagined color schemes on them.

Shocking announcement from this year's Star Awards 2014.

Today is the 3RD DAY IN A ROW Justin Ang from Muttons On The Move managed to get in the ""Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes"" category. 

In anticipation of expectedly-unexpected victory, MediaCorpse has announced a shocking cut in the number of winners from 10 to 8 in that particular category.

The CEO of MediaCorpse, Mr Pai Xi Lan explained the decision. ""We have a restriction when it comes to the size of our stage during the award ceremony. Just like his popularity, Justin's size is equal to 3 men's worth, so bo pian, gotta cut some winners off.""

Our reporter tried to get a response from hot favourite Elvin Ng with regards to this latest cut and he gave us a reaction typical of his acting skills - Expressionless.

North Korea's supreme leader, Kim Jung-Un is reportedly interested in buying over Singapore's television broadcaster, MediaCorpse after he told reporters that he ""sees something similar between MediaCorpse and himself"".

This came after North Korea's state media confirmed on Monday a 100 per cent poll victory for leader Kim Jong-Un in the country's stage-managed parliamentary election. (Read: http://bit.ly/1kGRAtu)

A delighted Kim Jung-Un explained his interest in acquiring MediaCorpse, ""Kaninasaeyo comrades! My hard-fought victory reminded vividly of MediaCorpse in the sunny island Singapore. They won the Television Broadcaster Of The Year for 10 years in a row, in a country where there is only one main television broadcaster, tough fight for them it must have been. I'm excited about the possibilities already!"" 

It remains to be seen if MediaCorpse will accept the offer but Kim Jung-Un has already send his invitation letter via what looks like a nuclear missile.

Yesterday's matchup between heavy weight Team Maseelee and Ultra defensive ICA came a shocking blow as Team Maseelee scored the winning goal from a spectacular 50meter run by their veteran striker 65yr Unker Jin Wu Ji. 

Jin Wu Ji tore down the wings as he dribbled past through the entire defense of ICA and left the defenders catching shadows. Captain Tak Boleh of ICA was furious with his fellow team mates for not doing enough to stop Jin Wu Ji. 

""Alamak? What they all thinking? Watching performance arh??? "" He told reporters after the match. 

This defeat came as a staggering blow to the Ultra defensive minded ICA as they suffered another defeat just 2 months earlier. Team Coach Teo Buay Pio was seen throwing his water bottle away after the final whistle was blown. 

""This is unacceptable.. we've never lost in our home ground for 70 million years! To taste a defeat twice in 2months is sibeh malu!!"" He blasted at reporters before storming into the changing room.

As a result of the recent dry spell, National Parks Body (NParks) has announced in a shocking statement that from April onwards, all plants in Singapore will be replaced by cactuses. 

Director of NParks, Mr Hua Cao Shumu from Japan, said: ""Ajinamoto everyone! No rain, no plants. No plants, no parks. No parks, me no job. Me no job, me no eat oiiiiishiiiiiii nehhhh! So cactus, good!""

When interviewed, half of the Singaporeans didn't understand Mr Hua's statement and the other half thinks that it is going to be a thorny issue."

378167172198277_803497822998541,"Full Apology Letter To SMRT

Unlikely as it may be, on behalf of all Singaporeans, especially those who where stuck on the trains between Yew Tee and Kranji MRT stations yesterday, we would like to bow down, kiss your mighty toes, and sincerely apologize to you for making the false and baseless accusation of service disruption, when your trains were merely running at a ""slower speed"" like you've correctly pointed out in your media statement. (See here: http://on.fb.me/1fPitUJ)

Car is something that we pathetic middle and lower class Singaporeans cannot afford, but we are grateful we have the honor to use your first world luxurious train service. A normal 15 minute train ride that ended up taking more than an hour yesterday is definitely not considered ""service disruption"" in the grand scheme of things, like for example the bonuses going to your fat pockets, which of course you rightly deserve for being an excellent public service provider.

Knowing our own intellectual deficiency, we should have realized that our untrained and uneducated eyes cannot observe minute changes like the ""slower speed"" that you claimed, and the ""lanjiao lah SMRT breakdown again"" that we accuse you of. Thinking back, I laughed at myself for making that statement because I clearly noticed an ant overtaking the train I was in and I should have known at that moment that we were indeed moving at a ""slower speed"". It was love at first sight with the ant, and MOE can testify to that.

Unknowingly, we've made a joke of ourselves through this little incident and we seek your kind and merciful forgiveness. In fact, I would like to recommend a close friend of mine to work for your company. You know how they say a great company brings out the best in their employees. His name is Pinocchio, I'll link you up with him on a separate note. Kthxbye."

And by great we mean rushing out of the office, rushing to the nearest eatery or staff canteen, queueing up, rushing through your meal, check your Facebook for 5 minutes, 5 minute smoke break (and for those who don't, wait for those who do for 5 minutes), buy some snacks from some random bakery to munch later on in the afternoon and rush to the office and resume your work.

Sinkapore Tourism Board (STB) has hailed Peter Lim as a national hero after the billionaire put Singapore on the world map once again after his bid for La Liga side Valencia was rejected. This is after a similar bid for Liverpool was also rejected in 2010. 

A STB spokesman, Ms Zhen Hao Lian, said: ""Peter (Lim) helped market to the world our very Uniquely-Singaporean trait of 'wayang'. We had to strike a fine balance of putting in a bid that is big enough to show off to the world, but not big enough for the bid to be accepted because we actually don't have that money.""

Prince William of the United Kingdom, who witnessed first hand the power of 'wayang' when he dropped by Singapore last year was seen nodding his head slowly in agreement of this latest move. When asked why he was nodding his head slowly, he replied ""I scared nod too fast, the wind speed too strong, my hair drop out some more.""

In a classic case of monkey-see-monkey-do, SGAG Holdings is reportedly in takeover talks with Manchester United worth up to $1 gazillion. Representatives from SGAG Holdings are already on the way to Europe and insider sources have revealed that the chances of this mega-deal happening is as positive as SMRT trains not breaking down again in the next coming month.

Transport Minister, Jiak Lui King has praised SMRT CEO, Teh Si Mon over the successful implementation of Ride-Longer-For-The-Same-Dollar (RLFTSD) scheme.

The most recent of which was an hour-long extension on the East-West Line on Wednesday evening for some lucky commuters.

""I share the joy of train commuters who gets to spend more time on our world-class trains for the same dollar. Commuters are definitely the main beneficiary of this new scheme,"" said Mr Jiak Lui King.

Singaporeans are already very excited about the full island-wide implementation of the Ride-Longer-For-The-Same-Dollar (RLFTSD) scheme with many hoping for the grand honor of walking on the holy grail, the MRT track."

Marathon organizers all over the world hailed the Singapore Marathon Rail Trail (SMRT) 2014 held yesterday as ""innovative"" and ""industry changing"". 

Not a race for the faint-hearted, race information is not revealed to participants to provide an element of surprise. The participants yesterday were definitely, well, surprised.

Singapore top marathon runner, Mock Ying Ren, who lost the race to an auntie said mockingly: ""Chao auntie, use umbrella to hook my leg! Next year you watch out!""

True to the style of SMRT of only sucking money and not giving away any, there were no prizes for top runners. For their own safety, participants were ""strongly encouraged"" to finish the race before the next train rolls along the tracks. 

Can't wait for SMRT 2015!"

Then we make LTA give us rewards for coming on time. Got rewards already, then we come on time. Brilliant right?""

Earlier this morning, 50 discipline masters from the Ministry of Edukation raided the MediaCorpse compound and sent more than a dozen artistes for detention classes.

This is after MediaCorpse replied in relation to criticisms of its Countdown show being too cheena by saying: 

""… some Channel 8 artists had chosen to speak in Mandarin. To insist that they spoke in English would have meant they might not have been able to express themselves clearly…""
Full reply here: http://bit.ly/1cS4dN7

When interviewed, one of the discipline masters, Mr Wo Hen Xiong said in a very fierce tone: ""We teach our kids to be bilingual no use one ah?""

One of the arrested artiste who declined to be named, said:
 
Artiste: ""You don't understand, I just cannot express myself clearly in English.""
Reporter: ""Well, didn't you just express yourself in English?""
Artiste: ""Oh fuck."""

Lousy Transport Authority (LTA) has announced that the heavy traffic at Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE) is not traffic jam, but ""scheduled traffic"".

LTA chief engineer, Shui Pian Plan told our reporter: ""We never anyhow plan ok? It is obvious that intricate planning by the greatest minds has been done when we converted a relatively straight ECP into a massively curved MCE. What can I say, I am a genius!""

At press time, local movie house, Golden Villager, has expressed interest in partnering LTA to screen movies in MCE given that the average ""scheduled traffic"" last as long as a full movie. Lucky movie-goers who happens to be ""scheduled"" to spend a longer time in MCE may even get to watch the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy in one go. 

Billion of dollars well spent indeed!"

SRRRYBC, Singapore Row Row Row Your Boat Council has released a press statement applauding Saiyidah's victory and adding on that the win was 99% because of SRRRYBC, and 1% herself.

A SRRRYBC spokesman, Mr See Beh Ngiao said: ""Saiyidah's victory proved that you don't need funding to succeed. So from now on, we'll cut all funding for our rowers. We've already informed Saiyidah to start rowing back from Myanmar.""

At press time, Saiyidah is uncontactable and GPS shows that she is somewhere along the coast of Thailand and should reach Singapore before Christmas.

378167172198277_759538324061158,"Hey everyone, I want to talk about the taxi driver article written by Mike Sim. So in one of the comments I read, someone said his father, who works as a taxi driver, asked, ""Who would hire me?"" His father's question gave me a business idea that I would like your valuable feedback on. Since I'm only a college student with limited business experience, I might make some mistaken remarks, and I apologize in advance for them. 
Anyway, in my social entrepreneurship class, I learned that businesses can be used to solve social problems. Thus, can we create a business that (1) ONLY employs taxi drivers aged 35+ who want to quit due to health, family, etc. reasons and (2) train them in new skills needed for the business? For example, can we start a small high-end bakery/restaurant etc. that exclusively hires past taxi drivers and offer them fair incomes and a better work/life balance? 
If the initiative succeeds, the business can start opening franchises elsewhere to hire more taxi drivers. If not, then alternatives should be sought out. Furthermore, should the taxi driver wish to leave the business later on, his/her skills, culinary skills in this instance but it could be any skill, would be transferrable, so s/he can start a sole proprietorship without waiting for someone to hire him/her.
Does the S'pore government has such retraining schemes already? Is it against employment law to hire a certain group of people exclusively? Sorry if my idea sounds stupid/unrealistic. I'm not a business student. I just want to help. "

378167172198277_756882067660117,"BREAK-NECK NEWS

In an exclusive interview with the taxi driver whose vehicle got covered in cement after an accident on PIE earlier today, we found out why he has decided to call it quits.

Shaking his head and looking at his taxi, the unfortunate driver, Mr Jia Tek Xi told our SGAG reporter: ""Previously driving taxi was already tough, so when it became too ""hard"" today, I decided to give up. I think if Kim Jung Un drop one nuclear bomb on my taxi now, it will still remain in shape.""

Mr Soli Bu Xiao Xing, the cement truck driver was very apologetic throughout the entire interview. He said: ""Soli soli, I didn't do it purposely! I wanted to turn the air-con speed up but accidentally press the ""Release Cement"" button. Paisei ah!""

This incident has no doubt cemented Comfort Delgro's spot as the most suay-ka-laosai taxi service operator in Singapore! 

Kthxbye!"

Singapore's most ""happening"" shopping mall, JEM will be screening the latest in the horror franchise, Final Destination 7 in 5D this coming week.

A JEM spokesman, Mr Si Beh Suay said, ""JEM has all the right elements in place to launch this popular horror movie. Just look at our track record since we've opened and you'll understand why the Final Destination franchise chose us over the other pathetic malls.""

Ms Xia Si Ren, a marketing executive at Final Destination headquarters told us, ""This will be a whole new experience for movie-goers with burning cars and shops, collapsing ceiling and shattered glass all over. Movie-goers might not ""get out alive"" if you know what I'm saying.""

Final Destination fans have already been seen queueing outside JEM in all sorts of heavy armor in anticipation for some crazy hardcore actions. 

Let's just say,

An ""offensive"" verse of a popular kindergarten song, Old MacDonald Had A Farm, has been banned, in an unprecedented move by the Singapore Kindergarten Forces. 

This followed a complaint by the Association of Women for Action-Bedek and Research (AWARE) three months ago that the ""offensive"" lyrics condoned discrimination against women.

In a letter to the Singapore Kindergarten Forces, the gender equality advocacy group objected to the verse:
""Old MacDonald had a farm
E-I-E-I-O
And on his farm he had a cow
E-I-E-I-O
With a moo moo here
And a moo moo there
Here moo, there moo
Everywhere moo moo""

AWARE's founder Cindy Fei Chang Pang said in a statement earlier today: ""These misogynistic lyrics tolerate and normalize the discrimination of women by referring to them as cows. I used to get called ""Fat Cow"" by my ex-husband and I believe it started with this insensitive Old MacDonald song.""

In an exclusive interview with Cindy Fei Chang Pang's ex-husband, Zi Ser Teng, he said: ""Ask that fat cow don't cow peh cow bu la!"" The interview ended abruptly as he suddenly started singing to a strangely familiar tune that goes along the lines of ""Purple light, in the valley…""

It remains to be seen what is the next song the AWARE group is protesting against next but rumor has it that it is going to be Beyonce's Run The World (Girls), cause they think that bitches, not girls, run the world. 

Kthxbye"

Artist Chen Yi Xuan explores the contemporary asian culture through her latest performance piece - Narrating Tears 

Narrating Tears 
Performance art piece, conducted at Changi Airport
props used: metal tears, tight rope, white dress.

In ""Narrating Tears"" Chen explores the reality of the current state of foreigners living in Singapore. Many of which struggle to make a living, it is through the shedding of tears and sweat that they overcome obstacles in their day to day life. 

""Our asian culture has inspired me to do this art piece as I felt that there is a need to address issues such as Xenophobia"", Chen commented before she stepped onto the wire netting. 

Metal tears which are lowered from an overhead framework would be collected and harvested by the artist. ""this is to symbolize the harvesting of all our hardwork"", continued Chen. 

Chen's piece will be ongoing for the next 2 months as part of the Singapore's Biennale. In just her first 2 performances, she has managed to gain heated attention in her impressive art piece. In addition, many viewers commented on Chen's effective use of medium to portray her message. 

""I initially thought that she was a deranged lady who had nothing better to do, but now I see the deeper meaning through her explanations"" commented Madam Lai, a housewife.

If you watch the Subaru Challenge backwards, the Subaru Challenge would be about a bored and tired guy putting his hand on his car out of boredom. Very soon, more bored people join him with their cars. Interestingly, the longer they put their hand on the cars, they more refreshed they feel. After 75 hours, authorities clamp down on their ""illegal gathering"" and confiscated all their cars. The people went home happy.

378167172198277_727968833884774,"BREAK-NECK NEWS

In a recent KFC Singapore's ""wittiest captions"" contest, the top 3 winners had a grand total of ZERO likes on their captions. 

See contest: http://on.fb.me/17GlmE1
See results: http://on.fb.me/1a4wdgH

After some very deep and intricate analysis, we realized there could only be 2 explanations for this:

1) The people behind KFC Singapore has a unique sense of ""wittiness"" that no one else in the world on Facebook appreciates
2) Their definition of ""witty"" is one that manages to avoid getting any likes (something we at SGAG finds very tough)

But it's alright, I guess constantly playing second fiddle to the ""Golden M"" must have not been too good for your psychological well being. 

That said, anyone up for some mouth-watering and juicy McSpicy at McDonald's Singapore?

The mane reason for the 3 horses found galloping around Kampong Pasir Ris yesterday has been revealed and it has gotta to do with the Singapore film ""Ilo Ilo"". 

In an exclusive interview by our SGAG reporter on the ground, we've managed to communicate with the friendly horses via mo-o-o-o-orse mo-o-o-o-orse. 

The leader of the pack, Huang Jin Mah, said ""I heard this Ilo Ilo was nominated for 6 Golden Horse Awards. I damn buey song, limpeh is the golden horse around here. You want me to show you my golden balls too?""

Another agitated horse, Mah Lu, interrupted and said, ""Is this Anthony Chen part of the 369 Zebra Gang? They kenna flatten and become zebra crossings already still not scared is it?""

It remains to be seen what action the horses might take next but the situation is definitely not stable now. Will bring you more live reports as the situation unfolds. Stay tuned!"

This was the epic conversation between the SGAG admins last night over PM Lee's use of the word ""meme"" and this was how it went...

Xiao Ming: What PM Lee talking about ah?
Muthu: What talking you dey?
Xiao Ming: There, the one which he said ""the idea of work-life balance has become so popular it is now a tag phrase. They call it a meme on the Internet..."" http://bit.ly/16pf294
Muthu: Haha as usual, he is so deep, I can't even see him anymore.

XM: Just because work life balance is a popular phrase
he says that is a meme, huh simi sai?
M: His line, I can't decipher, it's over level 9999.
XM: Let's discuss about this before I troll him!
M: Ya better double check, if not later kenna lim kopi. Let's check out wiki!

XM: Ok wiki says ""a meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture."" Wah like that he like correct leh!
M: But if you google ah, an ""Internet meme"" is a concept that spreads rapidly from person to person via the Internet, usually in a humorous way, largely through internet-based E-mail, blogs, forums, Imageboards, social networking sites, instant messaging and video sites such as YouTube.

XM: LOL this is too much to digest for a Friday night! The salmon sashimi I ate is swimming out from my mouth already.
M: Macam I go back to uni again sia!
XM: Ok so it seems like his definition of meme is more of the text book definition so theoretically speaking, he is not wrong right?
M: Yup. Technically not wrong cause he never say pop culture or internet culture. Plus wiki's definition is correct
and wiki is on the internet so Uncle Hsien Loong is correct
but it takes alot to digest that shit and cultural relevance is not there but theoretical relevance is.

XM: I think the crucial thing is that he said ""They call it a meme on the Internet"" and not ""They call it an Internet meme"". If he said the latter, then he would be wrong. 
M: If you studied semantics you would classify it more as a ""lexicon"". That would be a more appropriate word
to use than ""meme"". 
XM: Yea, cause in Singapore, people usually associate ""meme"" with ""Internet meme"" but our dear Supreme Leader of Singapura decided to use the text book definition of it.

M: WTF, I bet he didnt even think that hard when he said use the word ""meme"" and here we are debating about it all night.
XM: Wah screw this shit, my brain is gonna explode!
M: Uh uh siol, I think I can become uni lecturer!

XM: Haha please la dey, you dont go screw up other kids' future can!
M: Shut up you bitch! Next time I become PM then you know!
XM: Ya, then you can really flip stories faster than you flip prata!
M: F UUUUUUUUUUUUU!

So I guess PM Lee Hsien Loong shall live for another day without getting trolled. Just you wait sir, just you wait"

Singapore's official climbing body, the National Monkey Association (NMA) has called up to the national team, the Fairfield Secondary students who climbed their way into the school despite the #sgflood.

A delighted NMA President, Pa Hern Kao said, ""When I saw the photo of the students climbing the fence, I knew these kids were real talent! If you zoom in closely, you can see the excellent climbing technique used. I'm sacking my entire current climbing team to bring these new talents in!""

When interviewed, one excited student said, ""I didn't know I can climb so well, it just came naturally, like Spiderman! Am I Spiderman now? OMG!""

Singapore was hit by a once-in-50-years 'ponding' this morning with many areas in the West submerged underwater. Memories come 'flooding' back on the last time such a natural catastrophe stuck our island nation, it was a long time ago. 

In an exclusive interview with our SGAG reporter, Minister of Ponding, Dr Foo La Ding says, ""I would like to emphasize that unlike the last 'ponding' incident 50 years ago, we've a unique case of 'moving pond' this time round and our experts have told me that it is probably once-in-100-years. So don't worry.""

An aunty who was caught trying to fish in the 'moving pond' said, ""You know why like that? Cause this year NDP they never sing Dayung Sampan. The Ti Gong upstairs angry liao!""

S$100 million was immediately channelled to set up a focus group this morning and the group recommended using Singapore's famous useless sitting-ducks, oops I mean, the Duck Tour's amphibious vehicles as a mean of transport should this once-in-a-100-years problem of 'moving pond' occur again.

By the way, I'm roughly about 235 years old according to the Ministry of Ponding's prediction of ponding occurrence.

At times in the army, we do experience inclement weather, which most of the times is a good excuse for soldier to take a break (But not during field camps ._.)

We were based in Rocky Hill Camp in Tekong back then, so we didn't have the CAT 1 sirens like what they have in Ladang. Commanders would call the weather forecast to see if it is safe for their men to train.

Following last night's 1-0 defeat against Perak FA, the newly crowned MSL Champion, LionsXII is on the verge of an embarrassing early Malaysia Cup exit. 

An exclusive interview with a representative from Lions XII revealed the possible reason behind the team's poor form. Silk Poh said, ""Ever since Shahril Ishak became SilkproSG's ambassador, no one in the team wants to head the ball cause they scared mess up their hair!"" 

The team kit-man, Bo Cheng Sa, added ""Ki siao one. All the players spend one hour in the dressing room before every match gelling their hair, hoping to be the next face of the Silkpro!""

When approached, Sunny Dram coldly said, ""If the players don't start heading the ball, I'm bringing in the school barber from my boy's primary school.""

FIERCE SIOL. It remains to be seen if the tides can still be turned for the Lions XII but it is going to be an hairy issue that's for sure."

Sometimes its really difficult to find cabs in such areas, and we can't bear to book a cab due to the rising costs. Do try to check out main roads where it's much more populated, increasing your chances in finding one.

Please don't disturb the cab driver while he is driving. ^^;

378167172198277_684750218206636,"SGAG, could you make a (funny or otherwise) post gathering everyone's bad experiences with our public buses' drivers, ie. The Black Sheep?

Another bus captain was too busy to look at the bus stops he was obliged to serve today. Two people (yeaaah, including me) were flagging the bus down since it was barely in sight, and the bus driver kept looking right on an obviously straight stretch of road. 

This is obviously blatant violation of his responsibilities, and is FAR from the first time it has happened to the bus route 196 (over the past 5 years I've been taking it).

Why should consumers wait for the next bus after waiting an often-excessive duration (SBS, where the hell is quality control? Claims frequency of 10 minutes, bus comes after 30 minutes, still say acceptable?) -- just because the bus driver doesn't feel like looking at the bus station to check if someone needs to board?

We need to eradicate these bad sheep and make sure that they are never again allowed to drive a public bus in SG, because it damages the reputation of their company and their fellow drivers, and is a very irresponsible act.

I'm posting this here because when bus drivers screwed up in the past and I wrote to SBS once in a while, they'd give a stock answer that doesn't address their inadequacy. So I guess enough is enough.

SBS doesn't have a FB page for my feedback (probably doesn't dare to create one because there would be too many complaints on the wall, poor thing). 
To save many commuters from injustice and waste of time, and to put irresponsible bus drivers down, SGAG, please use your significant influence to try and make a difference! Thanks!"

In a stunning change in business strategy, popular Chinese restaurant Din Tai Fung has announced that they will no longer be selling dumplings or noodles. Instead, they will concentrate on producing toothpicks.

This revelation came after labour chief Lim Swee Say, says (no pun intended) whenever he goes to Din Tai Fung, his eyes are peeled not so much on its dumplings and noodles, but on its toothpicks. (Read: http://bit.ly/12YbG95)

Xiao Long Bao, a senior executive at Din Tai Fung, says ""Swee la this Lim Swee Say (no pun intended again)! See things we don't see! Say things we don't say (no pun intended again again)! It is shocking how we have overlooked toothpicks as one of the core pillars of our business.""

It is speculated that if our labour chief pays a visit to IKEA, the Swedish company will abandon it furniture business and focus on producing, pencils?

It has been revealed in a stunning announcement that this year's NDP theme song ""One Singapore"", was composed in conjunction with NEA's Mozzie Wipeout campaign. 

Unconfirmed reports have shown that since the sneak preview of this hit single was launched 2 days ago on Soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/straitstimes/ndp-2013-theme-song-one), there has been a mass suicide of mosquitoes in dengue-infested hotspots. 

Lab observations have shown that when ""One Singapore"" is played, the mosquitoes started showing symptoms of confusion. When the song hits the chorus with the catchy ""Wooo WOOO Wooo Wo WO wo"", mosquitoes started jabbing themselves until they eventually bleed to death.

Industry experts have applauded this revolutionary method of eliminating mosquitoes and organizers of NDP 2013 have said that the public is assured of a mosquito-free celebration come August the 9th.

378167172198277_579675745416747,"hy is It Cheaper/Affordable to Rent a Vehicle?



1. You want to save money
The average car costs $6000 a year to maintain(parking space, petrol/diesel, vehicle insurance, car servicing every 7,000km. 
. Stop wasting your cash and start only paying for a car when you need it.


2. You only need a car sometimes( Be environmentally friendly!)
We love MRTs and bikes as much as you do, but sometimes you really just need a car. Stop worrying and get there with us.

3. Your car is broken down. 
Let’s face it, not all of us drive the best cars in the world. And if your car is in the shop getting fixed again, renting a vehicle is a way to keep getting around. Also, having a rental car will save you taxi money if you are on multiple trips.

4. You might also want to rent a car if you are between vehicles. If you are interested in selling your car to get a new one, but they don’t work out well at the same time, you can rent a car for that period of time between them.

5. Variety
Any car rental service will give you some variety so you can choose a sedan, a van, etc. Roadside assistance is usually provided. Depending on the car, there may be an age limit, and you will have to pay extra fees for other drivers and other factors.

You are more likely to be satisfied with your rental when you rent from a locally owned and operated company, than, you will receive better service and better prices; it is their goal to make you happy. They want you to come back. No risk of being over-charged, flexible regulations, better customer service, better vehicle selection.

Yours Sincerely,
Ban Hong Lee Motor Services

The reason why Cristiano Ronaldo has been so secretive about his future has been revealed.The Portugese star apparently met Singapore businessman, Peter Lim to discuss a move to newly crowned MSL champion, the LionsXII. 

In an exclusive interview with SGAG reporter while on the Transformer roller coaster ride at USS, Ronaldo said: ""I'm excited about the prospects of scoring 10 goals a game and hopefully with this, I can beat Messi and win the Ballon D'or.""

LionsXII's coach, Sundram also expressed excitement at managing such a superstar. He said, ""Finally I get to try the 10-0-1 tactic I always use in Football Manager!""

Exciting times ahead for Singapore football."

This year's best unit has been awarded to the SAF Eyepower Division. 

The Commandoes may parachute down from the plane, the Guards may rope down from the chopper, the Divers may sneak up to you underwater, but it takes true skills to get things done and defeat the enemy just by using eye power. 

Staying true to their unit's motto of ""No Action, No Talking, Just Look See Look See Only"", Best Recruit Cyclops Tan received his Sword of Honor just by simply using his eye power while sitting at the cookhouse. 

As the saying goes, ""If you take a step back and look at things around you, you'll realize that a lot of things will get done by itself, or by somebody else.""

Happy SAF Day!"

It has been reported that PSI is set to rise up to ""unhealthy"" level this evening following reports of hotspots right here in Singapore.

Dr Hui Chen Duo, Minister of Dust said: ""This morning I turned on my fire hotspot monitor in office I kenna stunned tio. There're hotspots everywhere in small clusters all over Singapore!""

Our SGAG reporter went down to one of these hotspots and interviewed one of the people behind these hotspots.

Mai Du Shu, a student from Ruffles Institute, said: ""We've been hoping our Indonesian counterparts would help us with this. But with school re-opening tomorrow, no time liao, we've to take matters in our own hands. We're encouraging all students to start burning their homework in a bid to raise the PSI level so that school will be postponed. With the amount of holiday homework we have, we should create quite a haze!"" 

It remains hazy what the authorities will do to these students but if the PSI reaches haze-odous level, public is encouraged to tie their Hello Kittys on their noses. Kthxbye

understand that u guys are upset.. but given the circumstances of queue-ing for hours you wouldnt have just bought only one, would you? if you have spend an equal amount of time queueing to buy it perhaps you would have a different opinion? 

people who wanted them that badly, started queueing since 7pm at stores that opened til midnight.. i started queueing since 10.30pm at a macdonald's that closes at 12mn and reopens at 6am.. so is it right to say that i do not deserve them as much as u guys do? no offence but just a matter or perspective.. by the way i aint selling any of it... and i have collected the whole set except the witch cause i dont favour it..."

It has been reported that within 5 minutes of the launch of the limited edition Black Hello Kittys, McDonalds outlets islandwide has ran out of stocks of these popular soft toys.

Many disappointed Singaporeans have turned to the next best alternative. Orh Lu Lu, a huge Hello Kitty fan said, ""After the Macs staff told us that the Hello Kittys were out of stocks, I started chasing the black cat lepaking at the HDB void deck opposite! I had to fight off 5 other aunties to get my hands on the cat"" 

SPCA is reportedly very concerned about this issue and has advised HDB to dim the void deck lights so that the black cats are not easily spotted by these pussy fanatics.

After days of inactivity from staying indoors and not exercising as a result of the haze, the authorities have released a new index that sounds vaguely like the PSI called, the PSI aka Pui Sai Index to measure growing waistline of Singaporeans. 

Dr Ka Pui Liao from the Ministry of Fats & Oil however sees this problem in a different light. ""I've already proposed to the authorities to send these obese Singaporeans with a Pui Sai Index of over 400 to Jurong Island. I see great potential in harnessing and refining these human fats into precious energy that could power Singapore for generations.""

When interviewed, Pimple Tan, a secondary school student said: ""Wah like that my face the oil can refine also? I also want join leh!""

We represent a page that brings about awareness and advocacy about the latest environmental disaster which has befallen our country of Singapore. 

We are currently running a campaign against people working outdoors in these conditions without masks. We hope by changing our profile pictures to a shade of grey we can encourage and pressure employers in providing masks or reducing hours worked in such hazardous conditions. 

We hope you support our cause by sharing this and our page with your members. Your help is greatly appreciated!

Warmest regards,

With our last beacon of hope, the Singapore Flyer aka Mega Fan, being shut down due to the haze, it seems like Singapore is down to its last resort. 

Minister of Air, Dr Kuah Buay Tio has announced in a press conference for Singaporeans to unite together in times of a crisis like this. In a first-of-its-kind solution to tackle the haze problem, he has urged all Singaporeans to bring out their vacuum machines from their storerooms and suck the haze from 9pm to 12mn tonight.

Kuah Si Mi, a Singaporean living in Ang Bo Kio, said: ""This is a brilliant move! My grandmother say it is best if can install one vacuum on Merlion also so he can suck the haze instead of shooting water out! Swee right?""

Bookies have already started collecting bets for this evening's PSI score in Singapore. It seems like >200 is a hot favorite with many confident of a win despite the low odds offered.

Simi Toh Puah, an uncle who bets frequently on the number of times football players spit in matches, said: ""I tell you but you cannot tell people ah. I got ""insider news"" that the Indon farmers are going to have a burning party tonight! So you follow me, sure hit one! Confirm won't referee kayu!""

""WTF..Just 14 years Old drunk girl did this infront of all Public."" or

""Just 14 years Old drunk girl did this infront of all Public.""

Many Singaporeans have unknowingly posted these to groups which your friend could have invited you to without your approval, or directly on friend’s account, but that friend did not post it himself. These are fake video links being posted on Facebook, disguised as a video which could be posted by one of your friends.
In this case, if you click the link above, you’ll be taken to a fake video page, which tells you that you need to download a “Video Download Converter” in order to view the video. This is a tactic used by hackers and scammers to install viruses or trojan horses onto your system. Do not download this file. Do not click links such as this, as you may install malicious software onto your computer.

SUGGESTED FIX
No guarantee this will solve the problem fully as we do not know the virus' full capabilities, but if this has happened to you or a friend, you should consider taking the following steps:

1. Leave all groups titled as above and report it. Inform all your friends who are found in the group about this malware via PM

2. Remove/block any unknown, unwanted, or spammy apps. Be sure to remove “Fun Tube” as we’ve seen this one posting similar links before. Remove yourself from the mentioned facebook groups

2. Remove anything posted on your behalf by these apps so your friends aren’t fooled into clicking them. Run an anti-virus or anti-spyware program on your computer

3. Change your Facebook password"

378167172198277_639104512771207,"Twenty-one Malaysians were arrested in Singapore on Saturday for staging an illegal protest following the disputed elections in their neighbouring homeland, the city-state's police said.
The Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in a statement that ""while foreigners are allowed to work or live here, they have to abide by our laws"".
""They should not import their domestic issues from their countries into Singapore and conduct activities which can disturb public order, as there can be groups with opposing views. Those who break the law will be seriously dealt with.""
A police spokesman told AFP that the Malaysians were held under the Public Order Act, under which organisers of illegal protests can be jailed up to six months or fined Sg$10,000 ($8,100). They can also be both jailed and fined.
Participants in illegal protests can be fined up to Sg$5,000. Foreigners jailed in Singapore are normally deported after serving their sentences.
The Malaysians were arrested at Merlion Park, a popular tourist attraction along Singapore's Marina Bay promenade, for staging a protest ""despite repeated police advisories"" against such gatherings, the SPF statement said.
The arrests came three days after an estimated 100 Malaysians gathered at the same spot in conjunction with a mammoth rally in Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur by the opposition, which claims it was robbed of victory in the May 5 parliamentary elections through fraud.
Nine of the participants in Wednesday's protest in Singapore received police warnings.
""Their work and visit passes in Singapore are being reviewed by the authorities. Their employers will be informed of this. Further investigations are ongoing,"" according to an SPF statement on Friday.
The Malaysian opposition, led by former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, has called for a wave of protests after the ruling coalition was returned to power despite receiving less than 50 percent of votes cast.
Singapore was ejected from the Malaysian federation in 1965 after a brief union between the two former British colonies, but they are bound by strong economic, political, cultural and family links."

Either the escalator jammed and the lady got stucked and fell backwards or that she was rushing for the train, then lost her balance.

378167172198277_533207843360875,"Rumor has it that Adele, while turning tables, it got so heated up that she accidentally set fire to the rain. In order to avoid the skyfall of fire-rain, she started rolling in the deep mud in the nearby swamp. Upset, she looked at her beloved burnt tables and said ""Nehmind, I'll find someone like you"". True story."

I'm a Rafflesian and recently, an RG girl named Shriya dislocated her knee while playing in the netball carnival at school. She was doing her very best to win for her class but she injured herself in the process. 
She is a very very devoted The Wanted fan, and she really wanted to go see them at their upcoming concert in Singapore. However, due to this injury, she will be unable to go and see her favourite stars.
PLEASE help share this and trend #VisitShriyaSG and get The Wanted to notice it! 
PLEASE retweet and hashtag all the time and get it to trend worldwide! 
Because it'd mean the world to me, to Shriya's friends, and most of all to Shriya. So please help fulfill someone's dreams... Share, retweet, hashtag, status updates, ANYTHING, please help us out!

378167172198277_199703136827846,"Dear readers

It has been brought to our attention that the former Facebook fan page of The Temasek Review (TTR) has, despite our many requests and clarifications, continued to pass itself off as affiliated or related to our website, which is not the case.

Aside from linking their Facebook page to our website TR Emeritus (TRE), it has taken it one step further and recently ‘announced’ that Richard Wan, one of our current editors is the “boss” of the TTR Facebook fan page, which again is not the truth.

We wish to reiterate again that since our website was revived in December 2011, it is officially known as TR Emeritus and our only official Facebook page is located at http://www.facebook.com/TREmeritus and can also be accessed via http://facebook.tremeritus.com/.

Other than the above official Facebook page, no one on our current editorial team is involved or related to any Facebook page bearing the name “Temasek Review”. As such, the Team@TRE has no editorial control whatsoever over any other “Temasek Review” related Facebook page.

Please help raise awareness to other readers about our change(s) so as to avoid further confusions among netizens and bloggers.

For readers who still have any doubts or questions, please feel free to contact us using our online webform located at the “contact us” tab at the top of the site.

It doesn't matter what you think of them, and no one can ever tell you to change your perspectives. You can dislike them, which is fine and that is your opinion. But as a social media webpage boasting thousands of fan base, don't you think continuously making 4 posts that encourages netizen to scorn and ridicule our 'FT athletes' is a little insensitive?

What different is SGAG from that xenophobic website called STOMP now? Please do not engage in such actions. "
