I did a dialogue with leaders from the unions and labour movement yesterday. I told them this is unlike the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. Today growth is positive, EDB is attracting substantial investments, and we are creating many new jobs. The current slowdown is not an infection that can be cured with one course of antibiotics. What we need instead is a sustained longer-term strategy to build ourselves up, and go for growth.

We are working with businesses to transform industries, upgrade SMEs, and help companies expand overseas. For workers, we are investing in skills training programmes and job matching schemes.

Many countries face similar economic problems. If any country can succeed, Singapore can. We have the tripartite partnership, and will work as one nation together! – LHL

If you think this beautiful calligraphy is Arabic, then you are half right! It is written in Arwi, a written form of Tamil that uses an expanded Arabic script. The Singapore Kadayanallur Muslim League (SKML) presented it to me last night at its 75th anniversary dinner.

The SKML's roots go back much further than 75 years, in fact, to the 19th century. They comprise Tamil Muslims originally from Kadayanallur, a city in Tamil Nadu close to the southernmost tip of India. Weavers by trade, many left in search of a better life after British textile mills began exporting cheap textiles to India, putting them out of business. 

Some sailed to Malacca and Penang (and set up Kadayanallur associations there as well). Many arrived in Singapore with little more than the clothes on their back. They became labourers at the port, and sold wet ground spices for curries. 

Today, many have become successful professionals. They have made Singapore their home for three generations or more, just as so many others have done. 

The Tamil Muslim community in Singapore is small – about 20,000 – but have woven their own distinctive strand into our multicultural tapestry. The SKML works with organisations like the Singapore Indian Development Association and MENDAKI Singapore to help more Singaporeans. My congratulations to the SKML on your 75th anniversary.

Mr Peres was a visionary who served his country tirelessly all his life. I was privileged to meet him several times, and to benefit from his wisdom and friendship. 

I last called on him in April, at the Peres Centre of Peace in Tel Aviv. He received me graciously. Then 92, he was focussed on the young and the future. He told me why he was convinced that science and education were the way to foster greater understanding between peoples. 

Mr Peres was the last of the founding generation of Israeli leaders. As defence minister in 1976, he advocated the brilliant Entebbe hostage rescue operation. He was the only Israeli statesman to have served both as President and Prime Minister.

Scientists are still learning about this new disease. But we know that for most people it is mild, and in fact often causes no symptoms at all. Pregnant women are at risk, as they are with other viral infections like dengue and chicken pox. Do take precautions and get tested if you show symptoms.

Saya gembira menyampaikan Anugerah Jauhari Berita Harian kepada juara silat dunia, Sheik Farhan Sheik Alau’ddin dan Penolong Pesuruhjaya Kanan (SAC), Zuraidah Abdullah malam tadi.

Kedua-duanya adalah perintis dalam bidang masing-masing. Sheik Farhan berasal dari keluarga pesilat dan menjadi juara silat dunia ketika baru berusia 17 tahun. Sejak itu beliau telah berjaya memenangi lebih banyak pingat emas untuk Singapura dan dianugerahkan Biasiswa Spex tahun ini. 

Zuraidah pula adalah Melayu pertama yang menyertai Pasukan Polis Singapura melalui program kemasukan langsung, tiga dekad lalu. Berkat kegigihannya, beliau dinaikkan pangkat sehingga menjadi SAC, wanita pertama yang berjaya memegang jawatan ini. Kini beliau menyelia semua operasi Home Team di lima pusat pemeriksaan udara Singapura. Beliau juga telah banyak menyumbang kepada masyarakat ketika memimpin Yayasan MENDAKI dan kini Yayasan Warisan Melayu. 

Tahniah kepada Farhan dan Zuraidah! Semoga anda terus berjaya dan menjadi sumber inspirasi kepada kita semua – LHL"

The National University of Singapore conferred an Honorary Doctor of Letters on Mr Ban for his efforts promoting sustainable development and global peace and security. Glad that his Singapore Management University lecture yesterday was well attended - 3,500 people came! 

The UN is important to us. It is part of the international order that enables countries to live in peace, resolve conflicts, and tackle global issues like sustainable development and climate change. Without the UN, it would be much tougher for small countries to protect ourselves in the international arena.

Singapore is active in the UN. We helped to form the Forum of Small States (FOSS), a group of 100+ countries who work together to make our voices heard. This is how a small country can make a contribution and advance our interests in the world. - LHL

Mr S R Nathan was a man of great personal integrity, commitment and generosity. He lived life fully, and never gave up despite the challenges he faced. He could always be counted on to do his best for Singapore, even at personal risk and sacrifice. 
 
Mr Nathan played a significant role in our nation-building. He was a President for all Singaporeans, who cared deeply about racial and religious harmony. Even after he retired, he continued to share a lifetime of experience and wisdom with younger Singaporeans. 

Mr Nathan had hoped that Singaporeans, especially the young, would draw one key lesson from his life story: “to not give up.” Mr Nathan lived by this precept, and we will remember him for it. Thank you Mr Nathan, for giving the best years of your life and more to Singapore. Rest in peace. – LHL

In his condolence letter, PM Abe expressed his respect and gratitude for Mr Nathan’s act of courage during the Laju hijacking.

In the 1974, four terrorists hijacked a ferry, the Laju, and took the crew hostage. After eight days of negotiations, they finally agreed to release the hostages in exchange for safe passage out of Singapore. Mr Nathan led a delegation of 12 Singapore officials as guarantors to accompany the hijackers to Kuwait. 

Fortunately the incident ended well with no casualties. But it was a serious and harrowing encounter, and Mr Nathan clearly showed his mettle in the face of uncertainty and danger. 

As President, Mr Nathan made a State Visit to Japan in 2009. There he met the victims of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, the first foreign Head of State to do so. PM Abe mentioned this to Mrs Nathan just now. It meant a lot to Japan.

­PM Lee: We now have the core team for the next generation in Cabinet. But Minister or not, all of us are mortal. Minister Heng Swee Keat recently gave us a bad scare. I am very glad that he pulled through, and is steadily recovering. Doctors have given him the go-ahead to do office work, with minimum interaction.

I have therefore decided that Swee Keat will resume duties as Minister for Finance. DPM Tharman Shanmugaratnam will stop covering as Acting Minister. Swee Keat will focus on next year’s Budget and CFE, and I will appoint Lawrence Wong as 2nd Minister to help him out with the operational responsibilities duties for MOF.

Building up leadership and preparing for succession is the top priority. Nothing that has happened has changed my timetable, or my resolve to press on with succession. In the next GE, we will reinforce the team again. Soon after the next GE, my successor must be ready to take over from me. 岁月不留人

125845680811480_1183571138372257,"The second issue to review is the qualifying criteria to become a candidate for President. The main purpose of the elected President scheme is to give the President the mandate to decide on two major matters: reserves and appointments. 

The President who safeguards reserves and men must have the right experience to decide whether the Government’s budgets and spending proposals are sound and justified. He must also be able to judge character, motivation, integrity, ability of names put up, and to know what advice to seek and accept.

That is why candidates must meet the qualifying criteria before they stand for election as President. Candidates must have held key appointments in the public service like Speaker, Chief Justice, Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, or had experience in the private sector running large and complex companies like Singtel, DBS and Keppel Corp. The Constitution defines these as companies with $100mil paid up capital.

But this $100mil paid up capital criteria is out of date. When we set it 25 years ago, our economy was much smaller, and our reserves too. Now our economy has grown, government spending and reserves have increased.

The benchmark companies which we had in mind when setting the qualifying criteria have also grown much larger. Running a $100mil company is no longer commensurate with the responsibilities of the President, so we have to update the definition.

#ndrsg"
125845680811480_1183570795038958,"First, strengthening the role of the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA).

When we designed the system, we had in mind not just an elected President, the person elected by voters, but a President advised by a Council of Presidential Advisors. So that when the President makes decisions, he will have the benefit of the collective experience and judgement of the CPA.

We envisaged that over time, as the CPA became more established, we would build it up further. The CPA arrangements have worked well. The changes proposed to the CPA are incremental and straightforward.

#ndrsg"
125845680811480_1183570378372333,"REVIEW OF THE ELECTED PRESIDENCY

PM Lee: We have a good political, parliamentary system inherited from the British. We have adapted it over time to fit our needs, and one major change we made was to make the President an elected office. The President is the Head of State and the symbol of the nation. Therefore instead of being chosen by Parliament, he has to be elected by the people of Singapore.

We have operated this two-key system for 25 years, and made many adjustments to it. But some aspects have not been revised and we need to bring them up to date.

In January I appointed a Constitutional Commission, chaired by the Chief Justice, to review 3 things:
  - To consider how the President can give more weight to the advice of the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA)
  - To update the criteria for someone to be a candidate to be President
  - To ensure that minorities regularly have a chance to become President

The Commission submitted its report to me last week and made recommendations for improvement in all 3 areas. We are still studying the report and will release it soon.

Tonight, I won’t talk about specific recommendations by the Commission. I want to explain why we are reviewing the Elected Presidency and to tell you why in these 3 areas we should make changes.

#ndrsg"
125845680811480_1183569881705716,"Q3: HOW DO WE ENSURE GOOD POLITICS FOR SINGAPORE?

PM Lee: I have described some of our strategies to ensure that we progress together and to keep our place in the world. But for all these plans to work, Singapore must have good politics. If our political system malfunctions; if we fail to produce good leaders; if we cannot work together, and are divided among ourselves; then all our best laid plans will come to naught.

The Brexit referendum was a vivid reminder of the importance of good politics. The vote for the UK to leave the EU is already affecting the UK economy. But the bigger impact of the referendum was to deepen fault lines in British society. Why did it happen? Voters lost faith in their leaders and the whole political class. Large segments of the population felt that they were not benefitting from the country’s progress.

The same thing can happen here. Can Singapore be different? Yes, provided we have politics that unite the people and uphold our multi-racial society. Our leaders must be attuned to people’s aspirations and respond to their concerns, and our political system must be sound.

#ndrsg"
125845680811480_1183569465039091,"One of our big pluses is that our religious and community leaders have taken courageous stands. They condemn the terrorist attacks forthrightly, refute extremist views, and make clear that terrorists do not represent Islam, or Singapore Muslims.

Our Muslim leaders have expressed concerns to us about foreign preachers visiting Singapore who don’t understand our context and want to preach their exclusivist practices and doctrines here. I am glad our leaders are vigilant, making sure that the Islam practised in Singapore suits our multi-racial context.

I also welcome the call by Malay/Muslim community leaders to make the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS) compulsory, to ensure that our religious teachers and scholars are reliable guides for the community. I commend them for taking the initiative to deal with a sensitive problem. These measures will ensure that all asatizah in Singapore understand how Islam is practised there, and can guide their students to live in harmony with fellow Singaporeans of all races and religions.

#ndrsg"
125845680811480_1183568591705845,"TERRORISM
 
One urgent issue where we have to cooperate with our neighbours is terrorism.

Almost every day we read of new attacks somewhere: US, Europe, to Middle East, and closer to home, in Indonesia and Malaysia. Terrorist groups are active all around us in Southeast Asia. In Singapore, the threat is not just from outside but also domestic. We have arrested a dozen Singaporeans who have been radicalised.

Look at other countries. People react in two possible ways after an attack. One, they show a collective will to stand together. The other reaction is distrust and suspicion. The question is: which will happen in Singapore?

Our diplomats and security forces, the Home Team and SAF are doing excellent work. But they alone cannot guarantee our security and safety, or hold us together. All of us must do our part, from understanding our national interest, and supporting Singapore in our relations with other countries, to preparing ourselves to deal with terrorism, and standing together after a terrorist attack.

I will be launching the #SGSecure movement in September. It is a call-to-action to all to be sensitised, trained and mobilised to protect Singapore from a terrorist attack.

Ultimately, what matters most is our resolve to hold together and fight to defend our place in the world.

There will be differences from time to time, because of their deep-seated attitudes towards us, but today, on the whole, relations with both countries are good.

Last month, I was in Putrajaya to witness the MOU on the High Speed Rail between Singapore and Malaysia. PM Najib hosted us to lunch. The durian was good, but the High Speed Rail will be better!

125845680811480_1183567138372657,"Sometimes the interests of our friends will conflict, and we will be pressured to choose sides. One current issue which may upset the peace, stability, and friendship of the region is the South China Sea. It is a complicated dispute.

China claims the “nine-dash line”. Four ASEAN countries – Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam – have overlapping claims with China and with one another. The US has no claims but they do have interests at stake.

3 years ago, the Philippines launched a case against China under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The Tribunal heard the case, and in its Award in July said that China’s claim to historic rights within the “nine-dash line” is incompatible with UNCLOS. China has categorically rejected the Award as “null and void”.

What is Singapore’s interest and stand? We don’t have any claims of our own and we don’t take sides on the specific claims of any of the claimants. But in other ways, we have a lot at stake. Three things matter to us:
  - International law
  - Freedom of Navigation
  - A united ASEAN

Therefore, on this South China Sea issue, we have our own principled and consistent stand. Other countries will persuade us to side with them but we have to choose our own place to stand, and not succumb to pressure.

Singapore has a reputation to protect. We cooperate with other countries, but we make our own calculations. That is what makes us credible and valuable to others, to our ASEAN partners, and powers like the US, China and Europe. It has taken us a long time to build up this reputation, and we must be very careful to maintain it.

#ndrsg"
125845680811480_1183566558372715,"At the same time, Singapore is good friends with China and hopes that China will develop and grow well too. Because an unstable and backward China will cause Asia great trouble, as happened in 1950s and 60s. Over the last 40 years, China has been stable and prosperous, and this has greatly benefitted Asia and the world, including Singapore.

We are working with China on their “One Belt, One Road” strategy; exploring opportunities in infrastructure, connectivity, financial services, urban planning and clean technology; and participating in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

PM Lee: To start off with, we have to defend ourselves and that’s why we have the SAF. But we also need a network of friends. In our neighbourhood, with the big powers all over the world, and in faraway places.

That is why I have been busy with foreign trips this year. Beyond our neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, our most important friends include major powers like the US and China.

I just came back from an Official Visit to the US, at the invitation of President Obama. This was a significant gesture. My visit reflects Singapore’s warm and deep friendship with America, and was also a signal that the US values its friends and partners, and appreciates Singapore’s support for the role that America has played in the Asia-Pacific for more than 70 years.

We also need an overall strategy – to spot changes and respond to successive disruptions, to make our companies resilient and able to keep finding new ways to do business, and to prepare our workers to do different and new jobs during their working lives

That is what the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE), chaired by Ministers Heng Swee Keat and Iswaran, are doing.

It is not quite done, but I will give your a preview of 3 of the themes:

1. To help companies build new capabilities. The digital economy is one promising area.

2.To promote entrepreneurship as they play an important role in our society. Not just in creating jobs and prosperity, but with their resourcefulness and optimism, they give our society the confidence that “anything is possible”.

3. To develop a skilled workforce. That is why SkillsFuture is crucial. We are preparing our students well for the new economy, equipping them with relevant, in-demand skills. We are also offering courses to upgrade those already working and help them achieve deeper mastery.

Besides upgrading workers in their present careers, we are helping workers who get retrenched, or who change careers, to transition and find new jobs.

These are the ways our economy, and our workers, can thrive amidst disruption. This is how we can progress together, and thrive in a competitive and dangerous world.

125845680811480_1183562928373078,"Q1: HOW DO WE PROGRESS? 

PM Lee: We aspire to be among the leading cities like New York, Shanghai, London, Tokyo, Sydney. Yet at the same time, we want Singapore to be our home, where we belong and where our families feel safe and secure, where we build a compassionate and inclusive society, leaving no one behind.

But among all the economic issues we are dealing with, the defining challenge which we face in this era is “disruption”. Because of technology and globalisation, and disruption will happen over and over again, relentlessly.

We can respond to disruptive change in two ways: close ourselves off, and try to stop people from using the new technology; or, embrace change, and let the disruption happen, and adjust to it. 

Every industry is getting disrupted differently. EDB, SPRING Singapore, Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore - IDA and IE Singapore (International Enterprise Singapore) will work with industries and with the trade associations and chambers. They will develop specific programmes to help companies use new technologies and invest in skills.

We should continue to prepare for our future and therefore tonight, I want to speak seriously about the challenges we face. My subjects will not all be easy or fun, and some sensitive topics may even make us feel a bit uncomfortable. But it is my responsibility to talk candidly about them, tell you honestly what lies ahead, and what we need to do to progress together.

I was taken aback. I thought for a while and replied: If we wish for material things, we will regret it, because after we have got it, we will not be satisfied and we will want more. But what I would like is that we be blessed with a divine discontent - always dissatisfied with where we are; always driven to do better. And yet, that we have the wisdom to count our blessings, so that we know how precious Singapore is, and we know how to enjoy and protect it.

If just these two wishes are fulfilled, that will be enough. Then we can keep on building something special in Singapore for many more years, and “Achieve Happiness, Prosperity, and Progress, for our nation”.

PM Lee: I am sharing my concerns and my plans with you because all of us have a role to play, building Singapore together.

Whom are we building this for? Not just for ourselves but for our children and our grandchildren. Singapore must be a place where millennials (young Singaporeans born in or came of age around 2000) can chase dreams, in their careers and also in family, which adds meaning to our lives.

We might think – can things get any better after SG50? Can the best yet to come? The answer is a resounding Yes! 

This year, we showed ourselves, and showed the world, what Singapore can be, beyond SG50. We are a nation where every Singaporean has a place, as we saw at the National Day Parade – regardless of race or religion, able-bodied or special needs – we stand together with pride, singing “Count on Me, Singapore!”, because we know we can count on one another.

With this spirit, Singapore will advance in our nation building journey. Some troubles will surely come, and I am sure that we will not be short of challenges. We will be tested as one people, and we must not be found wanting.

Because this is a multi-racial society and multiracialism is the fundamental reason why we became a nation in the first place.

The President is the Head of State, he symbolises our nation so every Singaporean has to identify with him. Every citizen has to know that someone of his community can become President.

125845680811480_1183556221707082,"加强多元种族的和谐社会

总理说，新加坡能有今天的种族和谐，建国一代，尤其是华社，功不可没。他们和政府携手合作，奠定了一个多元、和谐社会的基础。经过多年的相处，大家在直觉上都明白各种族和宗教，都必须互相迁就，互相包容，才能维持现有的和睦。

不过我们的社会还没有完全达到对所有种族，无论肤色或语言，都一视同仁的理想。在条件相等的情况下，一位少数种族的候选人在华人占多数的选区竞选时，就会处于劣势。而新加坡，每个选区都是以华人居多。这也是我们实行集选区制度的原因。集选区制度确保了少数种族能在国会拥有他们的代议士。

总理说，要让一名非华族候选人当议员，已经很不容易。何况要一名非华族候选人当民选总统，就更困难。 所以，今年初，总理提议修改宪法，调整民选总统制度，其中就包括确保我国每隔一段时间，能有一位非华族的总统。

在现有的制度下，新加坡将来很可能长期没有非华族国人当选总统。这会削弱非华族同胞对国家的认同感， 影响我国社会凝聚力。这关系到新加坡的社会和谐，以及国家的发展与安全。所以，总理希望华族同胞会支持这个宪法的改革。这样，将来优秀的非华族人选，就能够成为国家元首，代表所有新加坡人。

总理说，调整我国的政治体系可让各个种族都有参与感， 都以身为新加坡国民感到自豪。这才能确保新加坡在面对各种挑战时，甚至是在危机发生时，大家可以更团结，从容应对。所以我们要坚守多元种族原则，让它延续下去。为下一代打造一个更美好，更灿烂的未来。

125845680811480_1183547578374613,"总理华语群众大会演讲2016

总理说，随着国家经济越来越发达，增长的速度必定会放缓。所以标新局 (SPRING Singapore) 和新加坡国际企业发展局 (IE Singapore) 针对中小型企业的需求，推出新的措施，帮助它们发展新的专长，利用科技扩大生意，开拓海外市场。中华总商会和其他商会也很积极地帮助会员寻找新的商机，推出各种计划帮助它们。

经过一番努力，我们已经看到了一些亮点，例如在一般制造业、家具设计、食品业等方面，有些传统公司转型 ，成功地向海外发展。总理也强调，危机也能带来转机。希望中小型企业能善加利用政府所推出的配套，进行转型，提升本地业绩或到海外发展。

除了帮助企业，总理也谈到政府推行的多项计划，跟企业合作，帮助工友调整，适应新环境。不少雇主也积极地帮助员工提升技能，借此提高生产力。另一方面，政府也帮助工友的家庭解决各种生活上的问题，让所有的家庭老有所养，壮有所用，幼有所长。

总理说，过去十年，政府推出了多项措施和配套，加强社会安全网。 政府尤其关心退休人事。因此，推出了终身健保和建国一代配套，帮助大家应付医药费。政府也改善了公积金终身入息计划(CPF Life)，提高了公积金存款利率，也推出了乐龄补贴计划。

但是，总理说，乐龄健保计划(ElderShield)还有待改善。因为现在，不是每个人都加入这项计划。总理说，卫生部将成立一个委员会来检讨这项计划。希望涵盖更多的人、提供更好的保障，同时确保保费是大家所负担得起的。

乐龄健保计划扩大之后，我们的社会安全网就可说是相当完善了。

125845680811480_1183538455042192,"Rapat Hari Kebangsaan 2016 – Ucapan Bahasa Melayu 

Dalam ucapan Bahasa Melayu, PM menekankan peri pentingnya masyarakat berbilang kaum Singapura untuk terus bersatu-padu.

Beliau turut menggesa agar masyarakat Melayu/Islam menguasai teknologi dan tidak lepaskan peluang untuk terlibat sepenuhnya dalam Ekonomi Baru. Beliau berharap masyarakat Melayu/Islam akan merebut pelbagai peluang untuk meningkatkan kemahiran dan taraf kehidupan melalui SkillsFuture.

PM juga menyentuh tentang ancaman keganasan yang semakin meruncing dan berbahaya di Singapura. Singapura terkenal sebagai negara yang berbilang agama dan rakyatnya bertolak ansur serta menghormati agama lain. Namun ada kalanya, pendakwah asing tidak faham konteks berbilang bangsa Singapura dan cuba memecahbelahkan keharmonian kaumnya. PM mengalu-alukan inisiatif masyarakat Melayu/Islam untuk memperkukuhkan Skim Pengiktirafan Asatizah (ARS) dan menjadikannya wajib bagi semua asatizah di Singapura. PM menyambut baik usaha dan azam masyarakat Melayu/Islam. Ini juga memberi jaminan dan meningkatkan keyakinan bahawa semua asatizah dapat membimbing pelajar mereka untuk mengamalkan Islam sesuai dengan konteks berbilang kaum Singapura.

Sebelum mengakhiri ucapannya, PM juga menarik perhatian kepada sistem Presiden Dipilih yang sedang diperhalusi untuk memberi peluang kepada kaum minoriti menjadi Presiden dari masa ke masa. Dengan keyakinan dan sokongan padu, barulah Presiden dapat melaksanakan peranan untuk menyatupadukan rakyat Singapura. 

Menggulung ucapannya, PM menekankan bahawa masyarakat Melayu/Islam adalah anggota penting yang telah banyak menyumbang kepada kesejahteraan dan kemajuan Singapura. Beliau menyeru masyarakat Melayu supaya meraikan kepelbagaian dan bersatu hati supaya dapat terus menikmati keharmonian, kemajuan dan kemakmuran pada masa akan datang.

125845680811480_1180183492044355,"I am too old to have played with Super Soakers, but my children loved these powerful water guns when they were small. So this BBC article on the inventor caught my attention and brought back memories. 

It is an inspiring story of Lonnie Johnson, former NASA engineer and inventor. It tells how he invented not only the Super Soaker but also the Nerf toy gun, which were both hugely successful. He used his fortune in royalties to set up a scientific lab that is developing green batteries and a hydrogen powered engine.

Johnson’s story is especially remarkable, as he is an African American who grew up in the American South in the 1960s, when blacks were still discriminated against and downtrodden. But he had a natural sense of curiosity and a “never-say-die” attitude, and he made it. 

He also spoke of why we must expose the young to ideas, and let them experience success. This will foster self belief and grow more successes.

So let us celebrate small successes, have passion and keep doing what interests us. Keep trying, and if at first you fail, try again. You never know where your efforts will take you! - LHL"

Joseph’s win signifies much more than Singapore’s first Olympic gold medal. He sweated and sacrificed. With determination and fire in the belly, he has shown a new generation of aspiring athletes that dreams are worth striving for.  

Achievements, too, are more than medals. Many of our athletes have come away from the Olympics with new personal bests, and valuable experience going up against the world’s best. Swimmer Quah Zheng Wen set two new personal bests in the pool. Rower Saiyidah Aisyah (Aisyah Rower) reached the quarterfinals, finishing as 3rd best Asian competitor. Sprinter Timothee Yap and shuttler Derek Wong went up against Usain Bolt and Lee Chong Wei respectively - both the best in the world. They have worked hard, and they all deserve recognition for their efforts.

The TPP is a deal. It is the outcome of a tough bargaining process that all 12 member countries have negotiated. Each agreed to improve market access to the rest, and commit to a set of common rules, in exchange for the others doing the same. 

It is not just about exports but also about imports. It will benefit consumers as well as producers. Our people will enjoy a wider range of products, services, and opportunities that will improve their livelihoods.

It also has a strategic dimension. It promotes interdependence instead of rivalry, and ultimately peace instead of war.

50 years ago, we were newly independent, struggling to build a modern economy. America was divided over the Vietnam War. Mr Lee explained to the US why Asia mattered to America, and why their active engagement was crucial to the millions living in non-Communist countries in Southeast Asia. 

Today, thanks to US sacrifices and efforts, we live in a more peaceful, stable and prosperous region. Singapore’s relationship with the United States has flourished. We are partners in many areas - trade, defence, R&D, education, and are continually exploring ways to do more together. 

Most importantly, we enjoy strong people-to-people ties. So it is fitting that we are marking 50 years with a scholarship for student exchanges in each other’s countries. We have come far, and have many more things to do together.

The performances were mainly by Teck Ghee residents, old and young. The items were chosen from a talentime competition that we held. They were thrilled to have a chance to perform at the Esplanade and practised hard. The result was a very good show enjoyed by all. We’ve got lots of talent, if only we know where to look, and can persuade people not to be shy!

PA launched the Senior Academy last year to encourage seniors to pursue lifelong learning. Yesterday’s graduates had completed a four-month long Certificate in Senior Wellness programme. The modules included Smartphone 101, Canvas Art, and even K-pop Line Dancing. The programme has been very popular and PA has just launched the Advanced Certificate in Senior Wellness. Now, seniors can enjoy deeper learning and at the same time, make new friends. 

Congratulations to the Class of 2016! May you continue to pursue your interests and passions. Age is nothing but a number, especially if you are young at heart. ;) – LHL

昨天参加了他们的毕业典礼。这典礼很有意义、因为每位毕业生都是经验丰富的成年人和乐龄人士。 他们充分地体现了“终身学习”的精神，活到老，学到老，令人钦佩。希望大家都能为自己的学习之旅不断策划，继续充实自己。 

所谓学海无涯 – 他们孜孜不倦地完成了四个月的课程，实在是不容易。 幸好学生们在课堂上互相扶持，帮助身边学习进度比较慢的同学。最后，大家可以一起戴着方帽，一起毕业。希望大家会一直不断地学习，也继续为社区、为国家尽一份力，让新加坡更美好。谢谢 – 李显龙"
125845680811480_1165961813466523,"Singaporean Zulfikar Mohamad Shariff has been arrested and detained under the Internal Security Act for terrorism-related activities. Zulfikar used social media to propagate radical ideology, glorify ISIS, and exhort Muslims to take up arms and wage militant jihad.

Zulfikar also helped to radicalise at least two other Singaporeans. He aimed to provoke Singapore Muslims to push for an Islamic state to replace our democratic system. Fortunately, our security agencies caught him before he could do more harm.

Such extremist, violent beliefs have no place in our multi-racial and multi-religious country. The government will be alert to spot such individuals, but we need everyone’s help to uphold and protect our harmonious way of life. 

Together, we can stay united and strong. - LHL"

We launched the HOME@JK initiative, which helps low-income Jalan Kayu residents retrofit their homes. The scheme provides essential upgrades such as wheelchair-friendly fittings, or even a new coat of paint, to make the homes more comfortable to live in.

We have seen so many brutal terrorist attacks in recent months, one after another. We are at risk of becoming numbed, and have to remind ourselves of the terrible human tragedy each time.

125845680811480_1161184287277609,"Attended Mr Chor Yeok Eng’s wake today. 

Mr Chor belonged to the Pioneer Generation who built Singapore. He dedicated his life to the country and to improving the lives of Singaporeans. 

As a young man, he joined the PAP to fight for an independent Singapore. As MP for Bukit Timah, he saw the poor neighbourhood turn into a beautiful modern estate, and improved the lives of residents. 

Mr Chor’s integrity and character shone on many occasions. In 1956, when a 2,000 strong mob threatened to burn down the former Yeo Hiap Seng factory in Bukit Timah, he stopped them. He reminded them that they were against the colonialists and not the local manufacturer. 

Mr Lee Kuan Yew considered Mr Chor one of his oldest, most steadfast and courageous party comrades. He said that if he had to choose one other to go to battle with him, he would pick Mr Chor. 

After retiring in 1984, Mr Chor kept a watchful eye over his old constituency. I often met him when I visited Bukit Timah for constituency events, and was glad to see him again last year when we celebrated the 60th Anniversary of Bukit Timah.

I would like to express my deepest condolences to Mr Chor’s family at this time of sorrow. – LHL

Harmony between our different races and religions is a fundamental principle of our nation. We celebrate our diversity, and share each other’s customs and cultures.

Unfortunately, in many countries, we are seeing more cases where people reject diversity and inclusion. Just look at the extremist terrorist attacks in recent weeks - Orlando in the US, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Nice in France, Puchong in Malaysia - each incident chilling, driven by hatred, and heartbreaking. 

In Singapore, we must always stay united as one people, and never allow any such event to break or divide us.  – LHL

One of them is the Skylab, a rotating structure built atop the new Academic Tower at the BCA Academy. It is fitted with over 200 sensors. The structure can be rotated, to position the sun and wind at different angles.

PM Najib and I agreed to build the HSR between KL and Singapore three years ago (bit.ly/29PWwem). Since then our officials have worked hard and long, through several Ramadans and Rayas, to reach agreement on key issues.

The HSR is a massive, long-term investment. Good execution will be crucial. We need to work closely together on many joint decisions and implementation issues. PM Najib and I will give full attention to this, because we want this major project to be done right.

With the HSR, people will think of Singapore-KL the same way as they think of London-Paris, Seoul-Busan, Taipei-Kaohsiung, Shanghai-Nanjing, or Tokyo-Osaka.

In my speech, I welcomed ASEM’s call for greater connectivity, which comes at a time of growing unease about the benefits of globalisation. We saw this most starkly when the UK voted for Brexit from the EU. Governments have to address this impulse to turn inwards. Increased connectivity has improved lives and brought progress to our countries. We must make sure our peoples benefit widely from this, and understand this.

Building HDB towns, running the MRT system, cleaning up the Singapore River, linking up the island with fibre broadband - these were only done through the hard work and ingenuity of skilled engineers. 

This is why we encouraged students to take up engineering, especially in the early years. And judging by over one thousand who attended the Institution of Engineers Singapore (IES) Golden Jubilee Dinner last night, many did.

At the dinner, IES honoured Minister Masagos Zulkifli and Prof Cham Tao Soon for their outstanding contributions to the engineering profession. IES also recognised the top 50 Engineering Feats in Singapore. These included Gardens By The Bay, Jurong Island, NEWater, and the invention of the ThumbDrive!

The IES provides feedback and technical expertise to the Government on engineering issues, raises interest in engineering, and also awards scholarships to deserving and needy students.

Defence is not merely an occupation in Singapore, it's also a duty and shared experience. 

This is why I was honoured to meet three former SAF Chiefs, (from left) LG (Ret) Ng Jui Ping, BG (Ret) Kirpa Ram Vij and LG (Ret) Winston Choo, along with other veterans at the OCS Commissioning Parade (bit.ly/298iBo4) and SAFTI 50th anniversary celebration last Sunday. The pioneers built the SAF from scratch, and under each successive Chief, our forces have grown in capability and strength. 

Thank you to everyone in the SAF, and the families of SAF servicemen and women too. Singapore would not be what it is today without your service and sacrifices. - LHL

I have written to Turkish PM Binali Yıldırım to convey my deepest condolences to the bereaved families. Singapore strongly condemns this senseless attack, which as President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said could have happened “at any airport in any city around the world”. It is a grim reminder of the reality of the global menace of terrorism. Singapore must remain on guard, knowing that it is not a matter of if, but when, such an attack lands on our shores.

Our MFA has contacted all of the registered Singaporeans in Istanbul and verified that they are safe. For all Singaporeans in Istanbul and Turkey, please register with the Singapore Embassy in Ankara, exercise common sense and watch out for one another. - LHL"

The new mosque opened just before Ramadan last year, and has been warmly welcomed by the community (Muslims and others too) in Punggol. 

The mosque is roomy and airy, with a modern design and an inviting, open plan. It also has an auditorium, seminar rooms and a rooftop garden. As Punggol has many young families, Al-Islah created a special family prayer room where families can pray together. 

My thanks to Dr Wan Rizal, the Chairman of Masjid Al-Islah, for showing me around this beautiful mosque. Thanks also to the volunteers for working hard every day during Ramadan to cook and provide food for the congregants. - LHL

Hari Raya akan tiba seminggu lagi. Saya gembira kerana sempat bersama para jemaah Masjid Al Islah Punggol di majlis berbuka puasa malam tadi, disertai Menteri Yaacob Ibrahim dan AP Pasir Ris-Punggol, Sun Xueling. Masjid ini dibuka tahun lepas, sebelum bulan Ramadan. Kehadirannya amat dialu-alukan masyarakat Melayu/Islam di Punggol dan sekitarnya.
 
Masjid baru ini lapang dan nyaman. Ia juga berkonsep terbuka dengan ciri seni bina yang moden. Masjid ini juga dilengkapkan dengan auditorium, bilik seminar, serta sebuah taman di bumbung masjid. Cantik sekali! Demi memudahkan banyak keluarga muda di estet Punggol, Al-Islah menyediakan bilik khas untuk keluarga bersolat bersama.
 
Terima kasih kepada Pengerusi Masjid Al-Islah, Dr Wan Rizal, serta pasukannya kerana menjadi tuan rumah yang baik. Terima kasih juga kepada para sukarelawan yang bertungkus lumus setiap hari menyediakan juadah berbuka puasa yang lazat untuk para jemaah. – LHL"

SQ368, a Boeing 777-300, was enroute to Milan from Singapore but turned back to Changi two hours after take-off due to an engine oil leak. The Airport Emergency Service team were on standby when the plane landed and firefighters put out the fire promptly.

Yesterday’s Officer Cadet Course Commissioning Parade had added significance because we are commemorating SAFTI’s 50th anniversary. Particularly happy that SAFTI’s first batch of officers and instructors were there to celebrate this jubilee with us. 

At the first commissioning parade in 1967, Mr Lee Kuan Yew said: “What we lack in numbers, we will make up for in quality: in the standards of discipline, training, dedication and leadership”. And so we did. Over time, this became part of the SAF’s ethos.  

My deepest thanks to every soldier who exemplifies this spirit to the full, and keeps our country and families safe. Long may this continue. Happy 50th anniversary to SAFTI!

125845680811480_1143492229046815,"Read this thoughtful piece in yesterday’s The Straits Times. The writer reflects on her childhood days growing up in a kampung. She remembers fighting spiders with her cousins, free roaming chickens in the compound, and gathering twigs for her grandmother’s kitchen fire. But along with these idyllic scenes she also recalls the potholed roads, dirt, discomfort, and lack of basic sanitation that was the reality of kampung life. It reminded me of Jack Neo’s movie, Long Long Time Ago 2, that I watched recently (bit.ly/1OsCMic). 

The rapid pace of change, and the uncertainties of a globalised world, make us nostalgic for an older and seemingly simpler way of life. There is such a thing as a kampung spirit, which we should maintain in our modern lives. But kampung life was hard, and we are much better off today. 

We should remember our past, but we should not idealise it. That is the way to take Singapore forward, and build ourselves a better home for the future. - LHL"

Many of the AMKFSC volunteers were themselves beneficiaries, like Muhammad Adam, 14 (in the blue shirt). His mother encouraged him to take part in Youth Infinity programmes, and he enjoyed them enough to want to give back to the community. That was a year and a half ago, and I was pleased to present him with a Sparks of the Community award today. 

AMKFSC Community Services started long ago, in 1978. For four decades, they have looked after residents well. Thanks to dedicated staff and volunteers like Adam, we can grow a caring community together. - LHL

125845680811480_1142353405827364,"The UK vote to leave the European Union (EU) in the #Brexit referendum is a turning point. It reflects the anxiety of the British population over immigration, their resentment at having to negotiate with and accommodate European partners, and their desire to assert British identity and sovereignty. 

Other developed countries also face similar challenges as Britain. We all live in a globalised, interdependent world. The desire to disengage, to be less constrained by one’s partners, to be free to do things entirely as one chooses, is entirely understandable. And yet in reality for many countries disengaging and turning inwards will likely lead to less security, less prosperity, and a dimmer future.

The next few years will be uncertain ones for Britain and Europe. Leaving the EU is as complicated as joining it. What new arrangements will be made? Will Brexit hurt investor confidence more broadly, and the global economy? How will Britain’s leaving affect the rest of the EU? How will this affect us, living in Asia but part of the same globalised world?

It is too early to tell, but we need to watch developments carefully. Nobody can foresee all the consequences of the Brexit. 

The British voters have decided. We wish Britain well. I wish David Cameron well too, who has been a good friend of Singapore and has announced his intention to resign as PM.

Singapore will continue to cultivate our ties with Britain, which is a long standing friend and partner. We hope in time the uncertainty will diminish, and we will make the best of the new reality. - LHL"

125845680811480_1140856889310349,"When was the last time you read a good book? I enjoy reading, but read less than I would like for pleasure. It is partly finding time, and also (if the book is serious) the effort of focussing on something not work related. But recently I have read several good books:

Ari Shavit’s My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel, tells the story of Israel’s nation building and the conflict with the Palestinians through personal stories.

Operation Thunderbolt, by Saul David, is about the spectacular Israeli commando raid on Entebbe airport in Uganda, to rescue hostages after an aircraft hijacking, which happened exactly 40 years ago.

A Rage for Order, by Robert Worth, is about the Arab Spring, and how things have gone since then. Also told through personal stories, it brings home vividly the passions and struggles that combined to cause the upheavals in the Middle East.

I read these books partly because of my April trip to Jordan, Israel, and the Palestine Territories.

Having just been on holiday in Japan, and visited the tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the daimyo (warlord) who unified Japan and founded the Tokugawa shogunate, I am now starting on a biography of him. Shogun, the Life of Tokugawa Ieyasu, by A L Sadler, was published long ago in 1937, but promises a fascinating read.

The National Library Board, Singapore encourages Singaporeans to read more, read widely and read together. They have launched a five-year National Reading Movement, and are offering more than 170 literary programmes and reading activities island-wide, in its annual “Read! Fest” which culminates in National Reading Day on 30 July.

125845680811480_1139832076079497,"Came across this The New York Times piece explaining why Berlin is a “playground paradise”.

It’s not just that the actual playgrounds are creatively designed, physically challenging and plentiful, but also the attitude of parents. German parents believe in giving their children the space for adventurous play — to explore, climb, build, and in the process, develop a sense of “selbstständigkeit” or self-sufficiency. 

The article describes how in the US (and I suspect in Singapore too), playgrounds are less challenging because parents are more protective of their kids. But it is good for children to learn through exploration and risk taking, and to take a few tumbles in the process. They will grow up more confident and resilient, better able to cope with unfamiliar or difficult situations. 

I asked the Housing & Development Board about this, because HDB builds many playgrounds in our housing estates. HDB tells me that they are trying out more interesting designs, like a forest-themed playground in Bukit Panjang, and a military-inspired design in Choa Chu Kang (where Keat Hong Camp used to be). I hope these will be popular with children and their parents, and will lead us to create many more fun spaces for kids! - LHL"

Fathers provide for us, support us, inspire us and lead us on the right paths. In many households, they are the head of the family, and carry much on their shoulders. But they also have to share with their spouses the housework and the duties looking after the children, especially nowadays with most couples both working. 

Today, spend time with your father, even if just to share what you did yesterday or what you plan for this week. We fathers enjoy hearing from our children, even about everyday, mundane things. Happy Father’s Day to all dads and dads-to-be! - LHL

Happy to visit the Singapore-Myanmar Vocational Training Institute (SMVTI) in Yangon yesterday. 

SMVTI came about when Myanmar leaders asked for our help in skills training. In 2014, both sides signed an MOU to set up the Institute. We assisted in building the premises, and also deployed 3 Institute of Technical Education, Singapore staff to develop the curriculum and help run the school. Companies from both countries have generously sponsored equipment and training facilities, and I hope more will do so.

The Institute trains skilled workers in hospitality and tourism, electrical skills and electronics, facilities management and engineering services. Entry to the six-month courses is very competitive, and I found the students bright and keen.

Myanmar is an old friend and partner of Singapore. We mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations this year, but historically our ties go further back into colonial times. In fact the same person, Dr William Montgomerie, was appointed by Stamford Raffles to help plan the growing city of Singapore, and later on also planned the city of Rangoon.

Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and I witnessed the exchange of diplomatic notes on visa exemption between our two countries. From December, Singaporeans and Myanmars will no longer need visas to visit each other’s countries, for up to 30 days.

Today, we are redeveloping Jurong to make it a greener, more inviting place for families to enjoy. I mentioned some plans in my 2014 National Day Rally — the new Jurong Lake District, a new Science Centre, more community spaces, and the High Speed Rail terminal.

The ASEAN-Russia Commemorative Summit in Sochi showed goodwill on both sides, and a shared desire to do more together.

Singapore is exploring our own bilateral SG-EAEU FTA, and we also encourage Russia to engage other ASEAN states individually.

President Jokowi described his efforts to improve the business environment in Indonesia, including in the Batam, Bintan and Karimun region. I said that we valued our economic ties with Indonesia, and our investors appreciated the Indonesian government’s support for their projects. 

We looked forward to our next retreat later this year. Indonesia will be hosting, and we are hoping to visit Kendal, near Semarang in Central Java, where Sembcorp has a joint venture to develop a big industrial park.

My father believed that Russia would play a major role in world affairs. He first visited in 1970 and eventually came more than five times. Even after he retired as PM, he kept the links up. He served on the board of the SKOLKOVO - Moscow School of Management. He also was a keen supporter of the Russia-Singapore Business Forum.

So I am very happy to continue building on our good relations. Our trade has almost quadrupled in the last ten years. But in absolute size, it is still not huge. 

That is why Singapore signed an MOU with the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) yesterday. I hope this will pave the way for an FTA between Singapore and the region. 

Beyond trade, today we signed two MOUs: one between the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth - MCCY and the Russian Ministry of Culture, and the other between Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and the Russian Academy of Sciences.

This year we are celebrating May Day in a cautious mood. With the global economy slowing down, many workers are worried and anxious. This is an issue in Singapore too, with retrenchment a reality for some. We are watching this closely, and have measures to help workers retrain and find new jobs. 

One scheme is the Career Support Programme (CSP), proposed by Minister Lim Swee Say. The CSP provides wage support for a year, to defray hiring costs and encourage employers to try hiring PMETs who have been retrenched mid-career, and hopefully employ them longer-term. 

Another measure is to help our workers upgrade and uplift themselves. Secretary General Chan Chun Sing told me NTUC intends to raise $50 million to partner universities to teach new skills to mid-career workers, including PMETs. I told him if he can raise $50 million, the government will write the cheque for another $150 million, for a total of $200 million in the NTUC-Education and Training Fund. NTUC will start by partnering with NTU, with more universities later down the road.  

In these are times of rapid change, we must take our challenges seriously, but we should have confidence. The Government and Labour Movement are ready, and with the people’s support for our programmes, we can emerge stronger than before.

I was honoured to have the chance to visit a place which means so much to so many, and to see the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque up close. – LHL"

""Never again!"" This declaration refers to Hitler’s murder of six million Jews during WW2. But taken more widely, it is a goal mankind has yet to realise in full measure.

Since the Holocaust, other massacres and genocides have happened. Mankind is capable of terrible violence. We must come together to prevent more, regardless of race or religion. 

Earlier, I called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו. Our two countries have a longstanding relationship. When Singapore unexpectedly became independent in 1965, the Israeli Defence Forces helped us to build the SAF from scratch. For that, we will always be grateful. 

PM Netanyahu and I discussed many areas of cooperation, from innovation and R&D, to cyber-security and countering terrorism. At the same time, Singapore is concerned about the Middle East Peace Process, like many other countries. 

I encouraged Israel to resume direct negotiations with the Palestinians to reach a just and lasting two-state solution. We are friends with both Israel and Palestine, and hope to see them living in peace together. - LHL"

He is the King’s Chief Advisor for Religious and Cultural Affairs and Personal Envoy, and like the King a firm believer in inter-faith dialogue and harmony. 

Next, I visited Al Maghtas, the site by the Jordan River where Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist. Then we crossed the King Hussein/Allenby bridge into the West Bank. 

Like us, Israel believes strongly in research and technology to improve lives. So it was an honour to receive the Doctorate Philosophiae Honoris Causa from Hebrew University. Also witnessed the signing of 3 MOUs between Hebrew University and Singapore institutions NRF, NUS and NTU. 

Ended the day with a tour of the Old City in Jerusalem. It is a fascinating place.

Jordan has been a good friend to us from the beginning. It co-sponsored our membership in the UN in 1965. Our two nations share a mutual interest in fighting terrorism, including ISIS. 
 
Earlier, I visited Petra, “a rose red city half as old as time”. It is a fascinating place to explore, with lots of natural beauty, culture and history. It was built two thousand years ago, yet still holds lessons for us. An ancient people, the Nabataeans, built a thriving trade hub here. 

The Nabateans adapted to the harsh desert environment through astonishing engineering feats, building aqueducts and water systems to channel and store precious rainwater. Two millennia later, we in Singapore still need to conserve water, and use technology to meet our water needs.

125845680811480_1095119080550797,"At the Committee of Supply (COS) debate for PMO yesterday, Josephine Teo spoke about the importance of valuing and celebrating parenthood as a society. One point she made struck me: quite apart from financial incentives and practical considerations, a country’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) depends also on historical and social factors, which are often not well understood. 

She gave the example of France, which has a TFR of 2.0 — one of the highest among developed countries. France has good social policies to support and encourage parenthood. But when Josephine visited France to study their experience, all the people she met gave one more explanation: ""1945"". France lost so many of its citizens in the Second World War (600,000 dead) that after the War ended in 1945, there was a strong desire - a national psyche - to repopulate the nation.

The TFR is a statistic, but it is made up of countless individual stories. I was reminded of the late Congressman Tom Lantos whom I met years ago. He was a Hungarian Jew and Holocaust survivor. He lost most of his family in the concentration camps. After the War, he emigrated to the US and became a Congressman. He had two daughters and 18 grandchildren. His daughters decided to give him as many grandchildren as they could, to make up for the family members killed.

Singapore is fortunate not to have experienced such calamities. Our TFR was 1.25 last year. We should do all we can to encourage couples to have more kids. Hence the enhancements to paternity leave, shared parental leave, and adoption leave that Josephine announced. They come into effect next year, so if you are thinking of having a baby (or another baby), now is the time to start trying! :) - LHL

Norway and Singapore enjoy good economic relations, especially in the maritime sector. Our ties go back more than a century. Norway established an honorary consulate here in 1906, soon after it became independent. As PM Solberg told me, the right to establish its own consulates overseas was the final issue which led Norway to dissolve its union with Sweden in 1905 and become an independent country. 

During her visit, PM Solberg spoke at the 6th Norway-Asia Business Summit, and gave a public lecture at The International Institute for Strategic Studies Asia (IISS Asia) – Fullerton Lecture Series.

Minister Masagos Zulkifli described how this has affected the reliability of our water supply from Johor in the Committee of Supply (COS) in Parliament today. We have been able to mitigate this using our other National Taps, but we must continue to diversify our water sources.

Ho Ching and I watched the movie yesterday. It told the story of Xinyao, how it began with student groups in the old Nantah composing 诗乐 (poems to music) in the late 1970s, then became popular with JC students who were bilingual, and now has caught on with a new generation, and even beyond our shores in Taiwan. 

Xinyao's history is tied up with the changes in our society and education system, and the difficult time which that generation of Chinese-speaking Singaporeans had, in schools and at work, adjusting to the new economy using English as the working language. 

I found the movie moving and powerful. And I got a surprise bonus — in one scene I found my old Chinese teacher 黄伟光老师 teaching a class in Catholic High School!

The first anniversary of a person’s passing is a significant moment to remember him and reflect on what he meant to us. The more so with Mr Lee Kuan Yew. The Cabinet had discussed how we should mark the occasion. My advice was that we should leave it to ground-up efforts. Groups should keep their observances in proportion, and focussed on the future.

The Cabinet recognised the strong desire of many Singaporeans to show their respect for Mr Lee, and honour what he did for us. We reviewed the events and observances that different groups had planned, and agreed that they were generally appropriate. They expressed the sincerely felt sentiments of Singaporeans, which my Cabinet colleagues and I deeply appreciate.

The idea that I should wish to establish a dynasty makes even less sense. Meritocracy is a fundamental value of our society, and neither I, the PAP, nor the Singapore public would tolerate any such attempt.

It is not a matter of if, but when, that an attack will take place here. Indeed, today’s attacks in Brussels happened even though the Belgians were on full alert. 

I hear that recently on a double decker bus, the driver stopped the bus, pointed at a bag left near the entrance and asked whose it was. The tension was palpable as he went round the second deck to try to identify the owner (whom he found).

We understand that faults and malfunctions do happen in our train system, and generally take them in our stride. But it is different when two young men lose their lives in a workplace accident. 

SMRT is working with the police to investigate the matter, to find out how the accident occurred. Whether it turns out to be an unforeseeable mishap, an individual lapse or a system problem, we must do our best to ensure this does not happen again. - LHL"

During the State Funeral Procession, gunners from the 21st Battalion, Singapore Artillery fired a 21-gun salute for Mr Lee from the Padang. 

I asked the SAF to collect the 21 artillery shell casings, to be presented to people, institutions and organisations that were closely linked to Mr Lee. 

The recipients include the eulogists at the State Funeral Service, the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, Housing & Development Board, National Parks Board, PUB, The People's Association, Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, and the Parliament.

125845680811480_1059036364159069,"Deeply saddened by the passing of Mr Lee Khoon Choy, a member of the PAP Old Guard, at the ripe old age of 92.

Khoon Choy, whom we all knew as “KC”,  started off as a journalist with Nanyang Siang Pau in the 1950s. Mr S Rajaratnam recruited him to join the PAP. KC fought in the 1959 elections and won, thus beginning his long career in politics and the Public Service. 
 
Mr Lee Kuan Yew once described KC as a man who “had it” — a man of courage that did not melt under pressure. In the early 1960s when the PAP was battling pro-communist factions in the party, the pro-communists targeted KC. He received a letter with a bullet, a death threat. In 1961, thousands of Chinese school students staged sit-ins. They threw rotten apples at him and shouted, “李炯才, 进棺材 (Lee Khoon Choy, enter the coffin)!” KC did not buckle. He stood with the PAP and was loyal till the end.
 
KC also served as Ambassador and High Commissioner to eight countries. As Ambassador to Indonesia, he played a crucial role in thawing relations between Singapore and Indonesia. Singapore had hanged two Indonesian commandos who bombed MacDonald House in 1965 and killed innocent civilians. KC persuaded Mr Lee Kuan Yew to wear a batik shirt and scatter flowers at the graves of the two men in Jakarta. This conciliatory gesture enabled Mr Lee to establish a relationship with President Suharto. In recognition of his contributions, KC was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1990.  

After KC stepped down from public service, he returned to his first love — writing and painting. I was honoured to launch his book “Golden Dragon and Purple Phoenix” in 2013. 

KC believed that “every human being should know his own roots. A tree without roots cannot grow. Human beings are the same.” Indeed, as we remember his life, we remember our roots and what our pioneers like him did, to put Singapore on the path it is today. My deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. – LHL

With an ageing population and medical science advancing rapidly, it is timely for us to refresh the campus. So I was happy to launch the new Master Plan today, to build a new SGH to serve future generations. 

Amidst the new buildings we will preserve links to the past. The Bowyer block (in pic, with clock tower), built in 1926, will be at the centre of the new campus. It will be an icon to honour those who have given their lives to public healthcare, and to remind us of how SGH has been treating patients for two centuries. 

Revamping the SGH campus will take 20 years of hard work. It is a worthwhile effort to assure Singaporeans of continuing good, affordable healthcare.

This new award recognises ordinary Singaporeans who have done extraordinary deeds, and helped to improve the lives of others. Over 85 nominations were received. 

Noriza was in the news in October two years ago when she helped a senior citizen clean up after he soiled his pants while grocery shopping. Others shied away, but Noriza bought him a clean pair of shorts and accompanied him and his wheelchair-bound wife home. Today, Noriza continues to visit them at the nursing home where they now live. Glad her selfless act was acknowledged. You can read more about her here: http://on.fb.me/204ThkD.

125845680811480_1040154269380612,"Singapore needs good policies and good politics to succeed. Our political system is working now. But we must keep updating it to continue to have a high quality government in the longer term – one that is honest, competent and effective, that is always accountable to the electorate, and that upholds a multi-racial society.

In Parliament today, I announced 3 things we will do to ensure this:

First, we will increase the minimum number of opposition MPs, including Non-Constituency MPs, from 9 to 12 by the next election. We will also give them the same voting rights as MPs. This will in effect aid the opposition, giving their best losers more exposure and possibly building them up for the next round. But I believe this will be good for the government and good for Singapore. No ruling party and government should ever be afraid of open argument. Ultimately, Singapore will benefit from a contest of ideas.

Second, we will further reduce the average size of Group Representation Constituencies, and create more Single Member Constituencies. The GRC scheme ensures that we will always have at least a minimum number of minority race MPs in Parliament. But we have to find the right balance between big and small GRCs, and the right mix of GRCs and SMCs.

Third, we will review the elected President scheme — to keep the eligibility criteria up to date, to strengthen the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA) which assists and advises the President, and to ensure that minorities have a chance to be elected President.

I didn’t until recently, though I learnt the song when I was in primary school, which was a rather long time ago. ;) It has been one of my favourites ever since.

The TENG Ensemble has beautifully combined this song with another children’s favourite, the traditional British folk song, ‘The More We Get Together’. I heard them perform it recently at the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations anniversary dinner, and now they have it on a music video!

I am happy to see many young people starting performing groups like the TENG Ensemble, showing off their talent and enriching our culture and lives. I wish them every success. – LHL

I spoke about this as well as our fundamental interests and international relations at the S Rajaratnam Lecture yesterday. The Lecture series is organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Diplomatic Academy.

Compared to where we started off 50 years ago, Singapore’s position in the world has improved immeasurably. We are respected and successful. We enjoy good standing in the international community and we have friends from around the world.

For this, we have generations of MFA officers and Ministers to thank, starting with our first Foreign Minister, the late Mr S Rajaratnam, after whom the Lecture series is named. In fact, MFA has done such a good job that people hardly know they exist, until they lose a passport somewhere. :)

In the end, both our external influence and our domestic success comes down to us as individuals. In the words of Mr Rajaratnam, “Being Singaporean is a matter not of ancestry, but of choice and conviction.” If we have that conviction, we can achieve success for Singapore as one united people, we can have an effective foreign policy, and we can keep our little red dot shining bright in the world.

Leng Joo left us suddenly when he had so much more to give. Singapore has lost a champion of the environment, leader of corporate social responsibility, and a fine photographer with a big heart. 

A passionate nature lover, Leng Joo often took photos of birds, dragonflies, plants, or ponds. The Singapore Botanic Gardens was one of his favourite places (and mine too).

Mr Schmidt was a visionary leader and a strong supporter of closer relations between our countries. Mr Lee Kuan Yew described him as a 'clear-headed and tough-minded' leader who had a thorough grasp of important issues. They found common ground on many issues, and were close friends for four decades. 

In 2012, Mr Schmidt made the long journey from Hamburg to Singapore to meet my father. The two friends spent three days discussing world politics. It was to be the last time they met. Their conversation was recorded and included in the final chapter of “One Man's View Of The World”, the book my father published the following year.  

Mr Schmidt also had an acute musical ear. I recall one poolside dinner my parents hosted for him. As usual my mother had some classical chamber music playing in the background. That evening she had on J S Bach’s Goldberg Variations. In the midst of the conversation, he turned to my mother, and asked if the pianist was Glenn Gould, which indeed it was. My mother asked how he knew, and he said there was something unique about Glenn Gould’s playing style. 

My deepest condolences to Mr Schmidt’s family and the German people on their loss. - LHL

This has been an eventful year for Singapore, and for our Public Service too. Not only did we celebrate SG50 and host the SEA Games, we also had the State Funeral in March, the Sabah Earthquake in June and the recent General Elections. Plus UNESCO inscribed the Botanic Gardens as a World Heritage Site, and we successfully concluded the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations.

For all this to happen, many agencies came together to work as a team. Public officers went beyond the call of duty to get the job done. The UNESCO inscription and TPP needed a lot of hard work behind the scenes. Even now, our agencies are tackling the haze situation.

The TPP is an ambitious free trade agreement. It covers twelve major economies in the Asia Pacific, including the US, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia, Mexico and Peru. Our exporters will have better market access to these countries, and investors can expect a more open and level playing field. The agreement will open up more opportunities for SMEs in TPP countries, and make it easier for them to do business. In the long run, our people will enjoy greater prosperity and more jobs.

Our pioneers worked hard to bring different communities together, through events and celebrations, and through deliberate policies on housing, education and the National Service. 

Religious and community leaders have built personal friendships and trust with one another. They discuss sensitive issues that arise with mutual respect and give and take. 

At the OnePeople.sg Community Leaders’ Conference this morning, I emphasised the importance of this harmony to our multi-religious and open society. We must stay vigilant, strengthen our ties and harmony, and ensure that future generations understand these complexities and work together to resolve issues amicably.

When Singapore became independent, we were defenceless. We needed the British forces stationed here while we built up the SAF. But the British economy was in trouble, and their government wanted to withdraw from “East of Suez”, to ease the defence burden.

Denis Healey was the UK Defence Secretary, and a friend of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He fought to keep British forces in Singapore as long as possible. 

The British bent over backwards to help us. British regulations required them to destroy surplus equipment, but Healey agreed to let us have their surplus equipment when British forces left Singapore. 

Healey also sold us the Hawker Hunter aircraft, and helped train our air force to operate and fly our first fighters. 

Mr Lee Kuan Yew described Healey as having a powerful intellect, “like a computer which kept on putting out new solutions as more data was fed in”. He later became the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and was described as “the best Prime Minister Britain never had”. 

My deepest condolences to his family on his passing. – LHL

Our challenges are now more complex. More issues involve multiple ministries. I am appointing three coordinating ministers to oversee three major areas: Teo Chee Hean will continue as DPM and be Coordinating Minister for National Security; Tharman Shanmugaratnam will be DPM and Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies; Khaw Boon Wan will be Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure.
 
Two ministries – the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Trade and Industry – will have two ministers each to oversee their expanded scope of work.
 
We also urgently need to prepare the next team to take over from me and my senior colleagues. Chee Hean and Tharman will no longer have specific ministerial responsibilities. I will put many younger colleagues into key ministries to broaden their experience. I have also reinforced my team with newly-elected MPs as well as existing backbenchers.
 
These moves will help prepare the next generation of leaders that will work with you. Half of the office holders will now be below 50 years old. I will do a mid-term review and expect to make further changes. We must have a new team ready to take over, soon after the next general election.

Mr Lee believed that education was key to breaking the cycle of poverty. He helped thousands of beneficiaries through the SBL Education Foundation. 
 
The Lodge helped the needy regardless of their religion, and collaborated closely with charities belonging to other faiths, such as Jamiyah and the Hindu Endowments Board. 
 
Mr Lee twice received the Public Service Star for his tireless efforts and good works. Even when he had a stroke and was hospitalised, he worried that his illness would delay help to the needy.

One was when Kit Chan sang “Home” and we sang together so loudly from all around the Padang that we could hear ourselves.

The second moment was when I met the kids in the bright LED costumes on the Padang after the parade. They were in high spirits and their faces shone with excitement and hope. I thought to myself, these are the faces of the future of Singapore. 

At SG100, these kids will be about 60 years old. I hope they will be back at the Padang celebrating again, remembering SG50, congratulating each other on how far they have come, and looking at more young, radiant faces of children and many grandchildren, and singing Majulah Singapura!

Will Singapore stay special for our children?

We said we would build more beautiful homes that Singaporeans could afford, and we did (e.g., Punggol 21 and Dawson).

We said we would strengthen our safety nets, and we did.  We introduced WorkFare, Silver Support and ComCare, built new hospitals, and made healthcare more accessible and affordable (CHAS, PG card, and MediShield Life).

We said we would create more pathways for our children to chase rainbows, and we did:
- NorthLight School (Official) and Assumption Pathway for students who failed their PSLE, because we believe in our young and we will never give up on them
- School of the Arts, Singapore, School of Science and Technology, Singapore to cater to varied talents
- First-class campuses for our Institute of Technical Education, Singapore
- New universities (SUTD Singapore University of Technology & Design, Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), SIM University (UniSIM))

We said we would transform our city, and we did (Changi Airport Jewel, T4 & T5; Gardens by the Bay, beautiful parks connectors and ABC waterways like Bishan-AMK Park).

We said we would transform Marina Bay and we did. In 2005, Marina South was still empty. At my NDR that year, I promised you Marina Bay would be special by our Jubilee. Today in 2015, Marina Bay is entirely transformed.

We did this together. We had a vision, we believed in it, and together, we realised our dreams.

PM: After 50 years, this sense of togetherness and purpose is stronger than before. The Singapore spirit shines when we celebrate our successes together, such as when our athletes made us proud at the SEA Games. Or in times of need when we help one another, like people rushing to help a man run over and stuck under a truck, or Singaporeans in Bangkok who contacted our Bangkok embassy offering their help after the #bangkokblast.

Our spirit shone brightest when Mr Lee Kuan Yew passed away. It brought out so much in us, and on the day of his funeral, we were mourning Mr Lee’s passing, but also affirming what he stood for, and celebrating what he had achieved. That day, something changed in us. Our shared moment of sorrow bonded us and we knew that we were Singaporean.

PM Lee: Glad to hear from Grace Fu that we have given out almost 20,000 SG50 Jubilee Baby gifts so far, including one to Tin Pei Ling. I hope couples will continue to have many babies beyond SG50.

Having a child is a major responsibility but we will help you, because every Singaporean child is precious to us. We will do so in four ways:

1. We will help couples live closer to their parents by introducing a Proximity Housing Grant. Every Singaporean household will be eligible, whether first-time buyer or not. You will get the Grant when you buy a resale flat with or near your parents, or your married children.

2. We will increase the amount of the Baby Bonus, and give it for every child. This will provide more support for larger families.

3. We will increase the Medisave Grant for Newborns. It will be enough to cover MediShield Life premiums for the child until age 21, and also help with other healthcare expenses.

4. Fathers play a vital role in bringing up children. You have to do your part. Paternity Leave will be increased from one to two weeks. The Government will pay for the extra week of leave. We will implement it on a voluntary basis first, and the Public Service will volunteer straightway. 

The Baby Bonus, Medisave Grant, and Paternity Leave changes will apply with effect from 1 January 2015.

Minister Gan Kim Yong leads the Ministerial Committee on Ageing. He will announce an Action Plan to make Singapore a model for successful ageing. 

One sneak peek from his plan: Many people in their 60s want to work longer. The tripartite partners have been discussing this, and they have reached an agreement. We will pass legislation to raise the re-employment age from 65 to 67 by 2017.

PM Lee: We are going to do three more things to keep HDB flats affordable and accessible to all Singaporeans:

1. The income ceiling will be raised from $10,000 to $12,000 for HDB flats, and from $12,000 to $14,000 for ECs, so that more households can buy HDB and ECs. 

2. We will raise the household income ceiling for Special CPF Housing Grants (SHG) from $6,500 to $8,500 so that two-thirds of all first-timer households will qualify. We will also double the maximum SHG from $20,000 to $40,000. 

3. We will help those in rental flats to own a flat. With latest changes, first-timers can still afford a 2-room flat even if you earn below $1,000, if you hold a stable job and contribute to CPF regularly. The Fresh Start Housing Scheme will help second-timer rental households own a 2-room flat. The flat will have a shorter lease and stricter conditions on resale. A Fresh Start Grant will be provided to help pay for the flat. We will support the family with counsellors to guide them to solve their problems holistically. The family has to play its part, and show that they are putting their lives in order.

125845680811480_962038533858853,"PM Lee: There is an African saying: “If you want to go fast, go alone.  If you want to go far, go together”.

HDB housing is one important way we make sure we go together. The HDB home ownership programme has been a tremendous success. Today, more than 90% of HDB households own their flats. 

In Singapore, no matter who you are, you live in a good neighbourhood with good homes, parks and waterways, and you feel safe and secure. This must always be the reality for all Singaporeans.

125845680811480_962037273858979,"PM Lee: We have to be alive to our external environment. We have good relations with our neighbours, but it may not always be like this. Even in the next 10 years, we cannot be sure.

On our National Day, just recently on 9 August, one Indonesian newspaper published an overview of the relationship between Indonesia and Singapore. The article quoted what a senior politician said about the haze: “I would only consider apologising (for the haze) if Singapore and Malaysia are thankful for the oxygen they enjoy (from Indonesian forests) for 11 months (each year)”. This may not reflect the Indonesian Government’s view, but we have to take note of it. It is a deep seated mindset – that a little red dot should know its place in the world. That mindset will not disappear for a long time.

We have to stay on top of regional developments, and watch relations between the major powers in the region. We have been able to maintain our security and standing in the world because we have a strong SAF, successful economy, and good diplomats and leaders. We must maintain and strengthen this if we are to hold our own in the outside world.

#ndrsg"
125845680811480_962036323859074,"TRUST & GOOD GOVERNMENT

PM Lee: We have kept faith between the Government and the people. As the Government, we have kept our promises. We are honest about the choices we have to make, and do not shy away from hard realities or sugar-coat difficult issues. In turn, the people trust the Government to have their interests at heart and they support its decisions. Therefore, even in tough times, we can act decisively together.

One tough issue we have is immigration and foreigners. Singaporeans understandably have strong views on it. The Government has heard them. But there are no easy choices on this matter. Every option has a downside, and whichever option we choose will involve some pain. 

PM Lee: I believe that I am doing what Singapore needs and what best safeguards your interest. It is my responsibility to make this judgement and act on your behalf.

#ndrsg"
125845680811480_962036100525763,"SELF-RELIANCE & MUTUAL SUPPORT

PM Lee: We knew right from the start that to strike out and blaze a path on our own, everyone had to pull their weight and be counted. That is why Mr Lee Kuan Yew exhorted us over and over again to become a rugged society. Our people must be robust and tough, able to take hard knocks, always striving to be better. No one owes us a living and we have to make our own way forward. 

But a rugged society doesn’t mean every man for himself. We are strong even though we are small, because we are strong together. The ethos of our society is that if you work hard, you should do well. At the same time, if you do well, we expect you to help others.

We must inculcate this same ethos in our young. That is why we encourage our children to play sports, and send them to adventure learning and character education – to bring up a generation who will grow up tough and able to work closely together.

125845680811480_962033710526002,"MULTI-RACIALISM

PM Lee: We separated from Malaysia because we believed in the ideal of a multi-racial society. We believed that before race, language, and religion, we should first and foremost, be Singaporean.

We encouraged all the communities to come together, but yet gave each community space to maintain their own cultures and ways of life. When difficult issues arose, we dealt with them together. We made extra effort to ensure that every community could hold their own and not be left behind. 

Therefore, for SG50, every community in Singapore is celebrating because all have progressed with the nation. Each group is celebrating with other groups, because we are one united people.

Tuck Yew has done a lot for my team and for Singapore over the last decade, especially these last four years as Minister for Transport. When I asked him to go to MOT in 2011, we both knew that I was giving him a very difficult job, but he did not hesitate. There were urgent things to be done, and public expectations were high. 

He put his heart and soul into the task, and made many improvements to the public transport system. The benefits will be seen in the coming years. The job is not yet complete, but we are heading in the right direction.

Besides Transport, Tuck Yew also served in the Ministries of Information, Communications and the Arts, Foreign Affairs and Defence. As an MP in Moulmein, he has worked to improve the lives of his residents.

Vivian Balakrishnan visited Linggiu Reservoir in Johor on Monday. The reservoir ensures that there is always enough fresh water in the Johor River to supply PUB’s waterworks downstream at Kota Tinggi.

Because of prolonged dry weather, Linggiu Reservoir is now only half full – lower than it has ever been. (See Vivian’s photos at http://on.fb.me/1KPSSzQ.) If the dry weather continues and Linggiu Reservoir is emptied, PUB will be unable to draw all the water we are entitled to from the Johor River.

I visited Linggiu Reservoir in 2012. (See my post at: http://on.fb.me/1eShI3x.) After my visit, I decided to build more NEWater and desalination plants, to make our water supply more resilient. One more NEWater plant will be completed next year, and a third desalination plant in 2017.

When I appointed the Committee two months ago, I asked it to redraw the constituency boundaries, to have smaller Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs), and at least 12 Single Member Constituencies (SMCs). The Committee was also to take into account population shifts and new towns that have come up.

They have done so. They have added one SMC and one GRC, giving a total of 13 SMCs and 16 GRCs. 

We will have more 4-member GRCs (6 instead of previous 2), and fewer 5-member GRCs (8 instead of 11). 

To make smaller GRCs and more SMCs, some boundaries have had to be changed. This will be the electoral configuration in the next general election. 

Wherever the boundaries may be drawn, MPs should serve the residents they represent to the best of their ability. And voters should support the candidates or teams who will best represent their interests, both in the constituency and as the government of Singapore.

I joked that Singapore is such a small country that even if we all stopped breathing it would make little difference to climate change. More seriously, we have few options for renewable energy. There is no space for nuclear power, and other sources are either not feasible (wind, hydro) or limited in scale (solar), so we have to rely heavily on fossil fuels.

But we will be a responsible member of the global community, and help to build consensus on an international agreement which is fair and implementable for all countries.

The family lived through the Japanese Occupation, the post-war anti-colonial struggle, and China’s Great Leap Forward. These tumultuous events profoundly affected their lives and fortunes.

In the 1970s, foreign investors had proposed building an iron and steel complex on Pulau Ubin, but he advised against the plan. The project was reconsidered, and eventually called off. So in a sense, MQ saved Pulau Ubin.
 
Later MQ served as our Commercial Representative in Beijing. When we established formal diplomatic ties with China, he was in the team which negotiated the terms. He then continued as our Charge d’Affaires in Beijing. He accompanied me on my trips to China, and gave me good advice. 
 
My thoughts are with his family during this difficult time of mourning. - LHL

We are still trying to find out the cause of the problem. LTA and SMRT staff and engineers worked through the night checking trains, tracks and cables. Today fortunately trains ran without a glitch, so far. But because we have not identified the root cause of the power trips, we are still very worried that the problem may recur.

Hope we identify and resolve the faults quickly, to prevent further inconvenience to commuters. – LHL

For population, we are managing immigration, promoting active aging, and most importantly, encouraging more Singaporeans to get married and start families! 

To forge national identity, we are nurturing shared values and experiences in our schools, NS and HDB towns. 

Some crucial shared experiences cannot be contrived - the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the tragic loss of young lives on Mount Kinabalu, and the triumph of the SEA Games. These times truly teach us what being Singaporean means.

Despite a late start (she started Primary 1 at age 11), Qiyu has excelled academically, and is now pursuing biomedical science in Temasek Polytechnic on a TP scholarship. Brandon is in the Tchoukball national team, and will be representing Singapore in the World Tchoukball Championships in August. 

This Saturday, come join CDAC and their supporters to make 50,000 Heart Knots (爱心结) at Ngee Ann City. The knots will be given to beneficiaries as a symbol of encouragement and good wishes. More details here - https://alittlefromall.wordpress.com/.

一人一点心，社会更温馨 – 华社自助理事会将邀请公众人士加入他们在义安城举行的爱心结活动 (https://alittlefromall.wordpress.com/)。

大家一起动手，编织出五万个爱心结献给华助会的受惠人士，为他们打气。虽然人生道路不一定平坦不过只要有恒心、有家人和社会的关怀和支持、我们可以为自己打造更好的生活。

邹启玉和李宝盛就是两个很好的例子。去年在华助会的晚宴认识了他们。启玉虽然到了11 岁才读一年级，不过她把握了机会，继续努力，现在已经是淡马锡理工学院的学生了。

宝盛对一种球类Tchoukball很有天赋。现在是Tchoukball国家队伍的队员，今年八月将代表我国队伍参加世界比赛。

希望大家踊跃参与活动，帮助华助社送出五万“颗”爱心。- 李显龙

Besides the Sky Gardens, the projects also feature a park-like environment, paired units and eco-friendly features. We will implement similar ideas in upcoming housing developments in Punggol Northshore, Bidadari and Tampines North. 

At the same time, HDB continues to offer new, affordable flats, like the ones to be launched in Punggol, Sembawang, Clementi and Tampines.

Many students find Mandarin hard, but this feeling is not unique to Singapore. Even native speakers in China find the language challenging to learn and especially to write.

Someone asked me for it. Here is the source code, the exe file, and a sample printout - http://bit.ly/1zAXbua

The program is pretty basic: it runs at the command prompt, in a DOS window. Type in the data line by line (e.g. 1-3-8---6), then the solver will print out the solution (or all the solutions if there are several), the number of steps the program took searching for the solution, plus some search statistics.

For techies: the program does a backtrack search, choosing the next cell to guess which minimises the fanout.

Here’s a question for those reading the source code: if x is an (binary) integer, what does (x & -x) compute?

Hope you have fun playing with this. Please tell me if you find any bugs! – LHL

#SmartNation

===========

Answer: As several of you noted, (x & –x) returns the least significant ‘1’ bit of x, i.e. the highest power of two that divides x. This assumes two’s complement notation for negative numbers, as some of you also pointed out. e.g. if x=12 (binary 1100), then (x & -x) = 4 (binary 100). I didn’t invent this; it is an old programming trick. :)

===========

Update: A few people suggested that I add a licence to the code. Have added it in the Google Drive folder."

He implemented community policing – the Neighbourhood Police Posts, the Neighbourhood Watch Scheme, and the National Crime Prevention Council. He emphasised crime prevention rather than reactive policing, and built strong partnerships with the community. It is his most enduring legacy, much admired by other police forces. 

My condolences to his family. – LHL

Some MPs shared their views too. Ms Chia Yong Yong felt that rather than spending time debating memorials, we should think about how we can ensure that his ideals and values carry on through the generations.    
 
I agree with Yong Yong. The ideals and the way we live our lives are more important than any physical thing we build. Yet a physical symbol is also helpful to focus our minds, if we can build something filled with meaning.
 
The memorial we decide upon should reflect and strengthen our sense of what it means to be a Singaporean, why Singapore is worth striving and fighting for, and how we can continue to build a harmonious and successful Singapore for future generations.

Kumar started life as a daily rated employee (DRE), upgraded himself, and rose to become leader of the DRE union, well respected in the union movement. 

My father entered politics by working with the unions, so that people like Kumar would have better lives and futures. Singapore has come a long way, but we have not forgotten our roots, nor what we stand for.

The theme was “Asia and the World – New Growth, New Strategies”. My moderator was Ambassador-at-large Prof Chan Heng Chee. Topics ranged from the relationship between Europe and Asia, to US-China tensions, how to charge the proper price for water, and the rise of global terrorism and extremism.

Mr Wan Saiful Wan Jan, CEO of The Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (IDEAS),asked me how governments should respond to demands for greater political participation and competition. My reply – with a team that has a mix of people with “grey hair”, and young, vigorous people!

Bernard contributed to Singapore in many roles – as a civil servant in EDB and MOF, as a Minister of State (in Mindef), as an MP (for Radin Mas and later Clementi in West Coast GRC), and in the private sector. Being a grounded, hardworking and humble man, he had friends from all walks of life.  

I first met Bernard nearly 40 years ago, when my father brought me along for a visit to Iran and Egypt. Bernard was in the delegation and we became friends. Later when I entered politics, Bernard as a senior MP was always supportive and generous with his advice. 

I was sorry to hear from ESM Goh Chok Tong in January that Bernard had cancer. When my father died a fortnight ago, Bernard wrote to me. I was moved. Despite his illness, Bernard made the effort to console me, and to explain that he was unable to pay his personal respects to Mr Lee because he was terminally ill. 

I replied to Bernard thanking him for all that he had done over the years. I said that we each have to make our journey through life, and live it so that when it is complete, we can say with good conscience that we have done our part.  Bernard had definitely done more than his fair share and contributed much to Singapore. I counted it my privilege to have been his colleague and friend all these years. 

Bernard was a staunch Catholic, so I ended my letter with the Latin blessing Dominus vobiscum – The Lord be with you. Rest in Peace, Bernard. – LHL

I am promoting Masagos Zulkifli to full Minister. He has performed well, both in his ministries and as an MP in Tampines. It is the first time we are having two Malay full ministers, which reflects the progress of the Malay community.

Other changes are because Chan Chun Sing is taking over as Secretary-General of NTUC from Lim Swee Say. So Swee Say goes to Manpower, and Tan Chuan-Jin goes to Social and Family Development. (Chun Sing also gives up his post of Second Minister in MINDEF, which Lui Tuck Yew will take over.) 

Swee Say has done a lot in NTUC: helping workers to upgrade themselves, finding them new jobs when they are retrenched, assuring them that they do not face globalisation and international competition alone. Chun Sing will have much work to do building on what Swee Say has done, but I am confident that he is up to the task.

These changes are part of continuing leadership renewal, to build a strong ‘A’ team for Singapore.

The date was 26 September 1958. My father was still practising as a lawyer in Lee & Lee. He was in Sibu (Sarawak) doing some cases, and was expected home. He sent this telegram to Lee & Lee (whose telegraph address was KYLEGAL SINGAPORE). It read simply “ARRIVING TODAY BATTLESHIP = LEEKUANYEW”. 
 
My mother did not understand the message. Was my father coming home on a battleship? The Lee & Lee secretary called the British Naval Base at Sembawang to check if any battleship was arriving from Sarawak, but they knew nothing about it. 
 
My father did arrive home that day, but not by battleship. He explained that he wanted steam boat for dinner, but as “steam boat” was two words, and telegrams were charged by the word, he wrote “battleship” instead, to save words and money! Sadly, since we had not understood the message, we did not have steam boat for dinner that night. :) - LHL

Eng Hen told the story of Lithuania, a small Baltic state close to Russia. In 2009, Lithuania ended military conscription (their form of NS). It had joined NATO, and assumed that its neighbourhood was peaceful. But after seeing Russia annex the Crimea and the war in Ukraine, Lithuania has now re-introduced conscription to build up its armed forces. 

When it comes to defence, we must never let down our guard. As Eng Hen said, by the time danger is upon us, it will be too little and too late to build up a defence.

Yong Yong cast the question in a broader perspective: whether it is right to think of the CPF as “our money”, to be spent solely as we choose. She explained how choice always comes with responsibility, and benefits always carry obligations. When we exercise personal choice (e.g. by spending our CPF savings early), there is a price to be paid (e.g. we may not have enough to support ourselves in old age), and that price should not be paid by someone else (e.g. other taxpayers).

Yong Yong had asked me earlier whether we had settled the CPF policy, and if so was it worth her while to speak. I said we had worked out the main changes, but strongly encouraged her to express her view and contribute to the public debate. I am glad that she did, and to such good effect.

“家”

农历新年是阖家共庆的佳节。在这喜庆节日，大家能深切体会到家的温馨。家中晚辈会向长辈拜年表达感激之意，并献上祝福，大人则会给晚辈发红包或压岁钱以示关爱，一家人开心庆团圆，沉浸在简单的幸福中。

正因为这个节日背后的深刻意义，即使我们工作忙碌、正在远行或是人在他乡，无法与家人一起吃团圆饭，我们也要尽力设法与家人保持联系。在这华人一年之中最重要的节日，我们不妨花点时间思考，生命中最重要，最珍贵的东西究竟是什么？家，对你而言又有着怎样的意义？

政府正竭尽所能协助国人建立温馨和乐，同时凝聚力强的家庭。我们通过“结婚与生育配套”，鼓励已婚夫妇生儿育女，并为家长们提供可负担得起的托儿和学前教育服务。我们希望今年新加坡会迎来很多金禧宝宝！为了鼓励多代家庭同住一个屋檐下，在生活中互相扶持，我们推出了三代同堂家庭组屋单位。我们也通过具有针对性的住屋津贴，鼓励年轻夫妇住靠近父母。另外，我们也透过建国一代配套、乐龄补贴计划和终身健保计划，来协助需照顾年长父母的子女减轻负担。

除了我们的家人和亲属，我们也应该加强新加坡这个大家庭的凝聚力。国人应该互相照顾，并向社会上的不幸人士和弱势群体伸出援手。我们正努力加强社会安全网，这包括协助低收入家庭拥有自己的房子。另外，今年底终身健保计划推行后，国人在面对庞大医院帐单时将不必担心付不起医药费。政府也检讨了公积金终身入息计划，协助各个家庭更好地规划退休生活。我们也扩大了就业补助计划，为低收入工友和他们的家人提供更多的支持。政府和社会人士将为需要援助的国人承担更多风险，让这些人士能更安心生活。我们会齐心协力，确保这些人不被抛在后头。

这些政策不是要取代家庭扮演的角色，而是为了协助维系家庭的向心力。我们不希望看到家庭关系变得薄弱；在其他一些社会，由于政府为家庭承担起更多责任，反而削弱了家庭关系。我们绝不能让这种情况发生在新加坡——不论是个别的小家庭乃至我们的新加坡大家庭。

凝聚力强的家庭是我国社会的基石。家庭成员之间互相照顾、互相影响、同甘共苦。家，激励我们向上向善，为自己也为家人谋取幸福。不论我们健康或病弱，不论我们处在顺境或逆境，我们的家会一直守护着我们，关心着我们。

单凭慷慨的社会政策或津贴，并不能打造幸福美满的家庭。家，不仅仅是我们和亲人之间关系的代名词，它更深层的意义在于我们如何维系亲情。因此，让我们用心经营我们的家：多抽空陪伴家人、教育孩子、尊敬和照顾年长的父母，以及积极帮助身边的人。

只要我们各尽本分，新加坡必将继续昌盛繁荣，不仅是取得经济上的繁荣，也能在这个多元社会，共筑一个和乐融融，和谐温馨的大家庭。。

最后，祝大家新年快乐！- 李显龙

125845680811480_859116007484440,"Chinese New Year Message 2015

“Our Family”

Chinese New Year is a time to celebrate with our families. It is a time to reflect on the blessings of having a family – to thank our elders for what they have done for us, to appreciate our spouses, to shower love on our children. It is a time to enjoy the simple goodness of family.   

So even if we may be busy, travelling or living in far flung lands, unable to come together physically for the New Year reunion, let us make the effort to connect with one another. On this most important festival in the lunar calendar, let us pause and remind ourselves of what truly matters in life, of what it means to belong to a family.   

The Government is doing all it can to help people build strong families. We are encouraging couples to have more children. The Marriage and Parenthood Package will support them, as will more affordable childcare and pre-schools. This year, we look forward to celebrating the birth of many Jubilee babies. We are encouraging three-generation families to stay close-knit, and making it easier for young couples setting up home to live close to their parents, through targeted housing grants. The Pioneer Generation Package, Silver Support and MediShield Life will lighten the burden on families taking care of elderly parents.  

Beyond our immediate family and relatives, we should also strengthen our larger national family. Singaporeans need to take care of one another, and especially of fellow citizens who are vulnerable or less fortunate.  We are strengthening our social safety nets. We have made it easier for low-income families to own their homes, introduced MediShield Life to give more protection against large hospital bills, reviewed CPF Life to help families better prepare for retirement, and expanded Workfare to support low-income workers and their families. The state and the community are bearing more risk on behalf of individuals, to give those who need help more peace of mind.  We are all in this together.  

We are doing all this to help our families stay together, not to supplant the role that families play. Our family ties must not weaken, unlike what we have seen in other societies where the state has taken on more responsibility. We must not let this happen in Singapore – either to our individual families, or to our larger national family. 

Strong families are the bedrock of our society. Family members not only take care of each other. They laugh and cry together.  Every member is shaped by every other. Our families inspire us to be better, not just for ourselves but for each other. Our families are always there for us, in sickness and in health, for better or for worse.

Generous social policies and grants by themselves do not grow strong or happy families. A family is not just about whom we are related to, but how we relate to each other. Therefore, let us make the effort to build strong families – to spend time with each other, nurture our children, respect and care for our elderly parents, and through our deeds help those in greater need. 
 
If each of us plays our part, Singapore will continue to prosper and do well, not just economically, but as a harmonious and cohesive national family, diverse yet one. 

Happy Chinese New Year! – LHL

In January, Mr Lee had undergone an MRI of the prostate which showed suspicious lesions. A subsequent biopsy found that one out of 38 samples contained cancer cells. 
 
Mr Lee decided on the surgical treatment option on the advice of a panel of doctors led by Prof Cheng, and is expected to recover fully. 
 
Data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre show that patients with similar medical profile and treatment have a cancer specific survival rate of 99% at 15 years.

He was one of the Chinese educated MPs who kept us close to the Chinese ground. Others like him were Yeo Toon Chia, Ho Kah Leong, and Chng Jit Koon. Many were Nantah graduates, like Dr Koh. One difficult decision they had to make was to support the reforms in the late 1970s that merged Nantah with NUS, and led eventually to the formation of NTU. 
 
Today we no longer have “Chinese educated” MPs, but many MPs speak Mandarin as a result of our bilingual policy. Our education system has progressed, and so has Singapore, thanks to Dr Koh and his generation.
 
My deepest condolences to his wife and family. – LHL
 
昨晚慰问了前议员高立人博士的家人。高博士曾担任义顺选区(1979-1988年) 和义顺南选区 (1988-1996年) 的国会议员，直到它被纳入宏茂桥集选区为止。
 
高博士是我国教育界的先驱，是新加坡国立大学(国大) 理学院的首任院长。之前曾担任南洋大学（南大）化学系主任及理学院院长。
 
当年的义顺是农村、有园林。在高博士的领导下，逐渐把它发展成崭新的组屋区。刚迁入新社区的居民面对不少困难，公共交通不足，新的房屋有缺陷等等。高博士很仔细的帮助这些居民，解决生活上的不便。
 
高博士自己是受华文教育的。像他出自华校的议员包括楊敦清、何家良、庄日昆。很多跟高博士一样，也是南大毕业生。当时，这群南大议员做出了重大的决定，很不容易，因为他们选择了支持教育改革，把南大与新大合并，多年后又改组，最后成立了南洋理工大学。
 
现在，我们已经没有所谓的受华文教育的议员，不过施行双语政策后，多位议员都能讲流利的英语和华语。
 
我们的教育制度改善了，新加坡也进步了。这些都是高博士和他那一代努力的成果，感谢他们为我们的付出。
 
这里向他的妻子和家人表示我最深切的哀悼。 - 李显龙

On Monday, IPS Director Janadas Devan gave a vivid account of the events leading up to Singapore’s independence on 9 August 1965. His conclusion struck a chord with me: that there was nothing inevitable about our separation from Malaysia. In fact our founding leaders had believed that Singapore could not possibly survive without a hinterland. The flow of events might well have ended up with “one country, two systems” and quite a different Singapore. 

Today we are in a much better position than in 1965, but we are still a vulnerable, small country in Southeast Asia. The dangers we avoided long ago are not permanently gone, but remain potential possibilities. If we forget our history, they may come back, and we will have to relearn painful lessons.

He was a successful businessman who held leadership positions in companies like the F&N Group, Asia-Pacific Breweries, SIA, Temasek Holdings, OCBC Bank and SPH. But he also had the energy and commitment to do an enormous amount of public service.
 
In 1983, Singapore started building the MRT. Dr Fam chaired the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC). The team completed the North-South and East-West Lines well within budget, two years ahead of schedule.
 
He was also chairman of the HDB from 1975 to 1983. Amidst a construction boom, contractors were reluctant to bid for HDB projects. But thanks to Dr Fam’s guidance, the HDB introduced pre-fabrication and mass production techniques, and got the housing programme back on track.
 
He sat on the Council of Presidential Advisers for many years and was also the founding chairman of the Nanyang Technological Institute, now NTU.

Japan's young are unhappy they have to pay for pensions and medical care for the old, at the expense of their own financial security. Meanwhile, the old bristle that the young are uncaring and ungrateful. 

Japan is renowned for its social cohesion and community mindedness. Yet the article tells of the elderly hogging seats on trains and cutting in line at supermarkets.

The Mosque-Cathedral has a fascinating history. Originally a church stood  there. When Muslim armies invaded Spain, they built a mosque on the foundations of the church. Over centuries, the Muslim rulers of Andalusia progressively expanded the mosque into a huge building that could hold 50,000 worshippers. After the Christians reconquered Córdoba in 1236, they re-consecrated the Great Mosque back to a cathedral. The influence of both religions is evident in the mix of Islamic motifs and Christian imagery.

-----------------------------

Here is an English translation of the Zaobao article:
 
By selecting a nearby neighbourhood secondary school, high scoring student saves on travelling time to spend more time on school work and family
 
When the PSLE results were released, 13-year-old Goh Wei Ling did not have to worry about which secondary school to apply for. This was not because her high score of 261 allowed her entry into any school of her choice, but because she had already made up her mind to apply for Evergreen Secondary School, a neighbourhood school that was next to her home.
 
This time last year, Wei Ling’s teachers and school mates thought she was “wasting” her chances but both she and her father, Mr Goh Poh Ling, a 68-year old taxi driver, thought it was a “worthwhile” choice.
 
Mr Goh said that his daughter could have gone to any school, but this one was the closest to home, and thus the most suitable. “If she went to a school further away, the journey there would have taken at least one hour, and a return trip would be two hours. That would have amounted to 730 hours in a year. Who would find the time to do their school work?” 
 
From her home in Woodlands Street 83, Wei Ling, who is now in Secondary One, takes just 5 minutes to walk to school everyday. The time she saves on traveling is spent on school work and with her family. “Lights out” is at 9.30pm and her family life is disciplined and healthy. 
 
Wei Ling said, “Rather than a school’s name or reputation, what matters more to my parents are good moral values. Every day, I spend most of my time with my family, and not on travelling. Ever since I was in Primary Four, I had already wanted to attend Evergreen and it is better than what I imagined.”
 
Wei Ling’s elder brother graduated from Evergreen, and was the school’s head prefect. He did well in his ‘O’ Levels, scoring eight A1s. Mr Goh related with pride how his children did not receive any tuition, as he could neither afford the fees nor the time. “For me, nothing is more important than a good upbringing, and the neighbourhood schools are not bad. If the child works hard, they can achieve good results, too. I am not from the Ministry of Education, but I believe that every school is a good school.” 
 
Brand name schools are attractive, but in the eyes of Mr Goh, what is more important is the sort of environment that suits the child. 
 
“If the child has the ability, they can go anywhere. Brand name schools are good, but the competition there is also strong. You may be first elsewhere, but be pushed down by the tougher environment. As parents, we should not let our children feel belittled. Instead, let them feel empowered. I will not insist that my children become doctors. Whatever she chooses to do, I will support as long as her heart is set on it.”
 
Wei Ling added that while many people may feel that neighbourhood schools are not as good, she disagrees. “I like Evergreen Secondary School very much and I have learnt a lot about life and being a better person here.”
 
Parent wants his child to be less tired
 
Siti Nurjaslina Bte Jeffry, 13, also performed well at last year’s PSLE. She chose to go to Fuhua Secondary School. Not only is it near her home, she was also attracted to their shooting CCA.
 
Even though she did not make it to the CCA, Siti was not disappointed as there were many other interesting CCAs she could choose from, and she now enjoys being part of the Malay Cultural Group. 
 
Siti’s father, Mr Jufri, a 44-year-old technician, said, “Life is already stressful in Singapore. I hope my children will not be too stressed. Her results could have gotten her into a brand name school, but she will be very tired. I don’t want her to be worn out. When you are under pressure, it will also be difficult to make friends and enjoy their friendship.”"
125845680811480_823864684342906,"I visited the Battle for Merger exhibition in October. This was the book of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s radio talks in 1961, explaining what the fight against the Communists was about, and why Singapore needed Merger with Malaya. 

The Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) was a violent, illegal organisation. So it operated secretly, underground. But the Communists infiltrated open, legal organisations like trade unions, student associations and political parties. These supported the Communist cause, but denied that they themselves were Communist. Mr Lee exposed this Communist united front tactic.

I took these photos of a fascinating exhibit: a pair of original handwritten documents. One was a trade union document, signed 林清祥 Lim Chin Siong. He was the leader of the Barisan Sosialis, the main open front political party. The other was a Communist study cell document, signed 王明 Wang Ming. The handwriting was identical. In fact Wang Ming was Lim Chin Siong’s party name; Communist cadres took party names to conceal their real identities. So Lim Chin Siong was a Communist, and the Barisan Sosialis was Communist controlled.

This was more than 50 years ago. Many old Communist and pro-Communist activists have reconciled with their past, and become good citizens. But a few hard core ones still deny these historical facts. They don’t want to admit that they had fought on the wrong side, and that luckily for Singapore they lost. Some “revisionist” historians make this argument too. One motivation: cast doubt on the legitimacy of the PAP government, not just in the 1960s, but today.

The British have been declassifying documents from their archives in London, and making them available to the public. Also senior CPM leaders like Chin Peng, Eu Chooi Yip, Fong Chong Pik (aka the Plen) and others have published memoirs. Their first person accounts, like the British documents, confirm the extent of the Communist united front in Singapore, and leave no doubt that the Barisan was formed at the instigation of the CPM, and that Lim Chin Siong was a Communist cadre.

We have put together an account using evidence from the British archives as well as CPM sources, which confirm that Mr Lee Kuan Yew told the truth. Here it is, for your weekend reading. http://bit.ly/16BGul3 – LHL

Singapore has a reputation for being a safe country because we have a good and capable Police Force, and our population trusts and cooperates with the Home Team.
 
But we cannot be complacent. As the Chinese saying goes 道高一尺，魔高一丈. As criminals get smarter, so must the police. The police must be ready for new threats, like cyber-crime and terrorism.

Thank you to all police officers, senior and junior, for keeping our streets and homes safe.  May you continue to bring honour to the force, and success to Singapore. - LHL

After retirement, he was the President of the SAF Veterans’ League.

That is why we welcome the broad international coalition, including the US and many Muslim countries, against ISIS and the terrorist threat. We are seriously considering how Singapore can be a helpful partner in this fight.

On the sidelines of ASEM, I met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. We have been studying a third government-to-government project with China, in the Western region. We are talking to the Chinese to understand their thinking for developing the Western region, so that we can shape the project to fit China’s priorities and needs.

125845680811480_787503657979009,"Visited the Battle for Merger exhibition at the National Library with my Teck Ghee activists. In 1961, Mr Lee Kuan Yew gave 12 radio talks, telling the inside story of the fight between the non-Communists and Communists, and explaining to Singaporeans what was at stake. Later he published the talks as a book, The Battle for Merger. The book has just been republished; hence the exhibition.

The radio talks were a crucial move in winning the hearts and minds of the people. It led to Singapore joining Malaysia, then Separation and today’s independent Singapore. Had Mr Lee and the non-Communist side lost, our history would have been totally different. 

Mr Lee worked very very hard to write and deliver the talks. I remember the “family holiday” in Cameron Highlands in August 1961, which we took so that my father could compose the talks away from the day to day pressures in Singapore. His secretary came with us, and there were multiple drafts and redrafts all over the flat in Cluny Lodge. 

I also remember following my father to Radio Singapore to record the talks. He broadcast 12 talks, in 3 languages, making a total of 36 broadcasts in just one month. Now that I have done my own talks and speeches, and know how much work goes into a single short broadcast, e.g. the National Day Message, I understand what a superhuman effort this was.

The subject was serious, but Mr Lee presented it simply and vividly. Singaporeans listened to the broadcasts eagerly. When the book came out, I read it, fascinated. I still have my old copy. It still reads like a thriller today.

After more than 50 years, Singapore has changed enormously, and vastly for the better. Most of today’s Singaporeans were born long after the broadcasts. They hardly know what the fight was about, why it mattered so much, and how it is still relevant today. 

That is why for #SG50, we are republishing The Battle for Merger. Do look up the book, and visit the exhibition if you can. It's on the 7th floor of the National Library Building at Bugis until 30th November.– LHL

今早和宏茂桥基层领袖参观了在国家图书馆展示的《争取合并的斗争》展览。初版的《争取合并的斗争》收录了建国总理李光耀在1961年12次电台广播内容，其中详细的说明人民行动党非共和亲共两派针对与马来亚合并而展开的政治斗争。通过这些广播，人民行动党非共派说服了国人支持新加坡与马来西亚合并，过后成了独立国家。如果当时国人做了其他的选择，当时的经历和现在的成果，会是很不同的。

建国总理非常明白合并对当时新加坡的前景，非常重要，费尽了体力和心思，为了就是要很明确的解释给国人具体的情形和后果。1961年8月，我们全家就上了金马伦高原陪着李先生让他能专心的写稿。印象中，演讲稿写了又改了好几遍，整间房子到处摆着一叠叠的演讲稿。最后，在一个月内做了36 次的电台广播，三种语言，每一种语言12次，很耗体力， 不过他坚持下去，完成重要的任务。

过了50年，很多人对为合并的斗争的历史背景和人物都已经不熟悉了，不过这段历史对今天的新加坡还是有重大意义，因此我们再出版了《争取合并的斗争》加上展览，让国人认识它，了解它。有些展示品，例如有关人士的亲笔记录等，是第一次公开展示。《联合早报》配合《争取合并的斗争》的再版，制作了“解读李光耀十二讲”中文电子书。可以点击 www.zaobao.sg/lkyradiotalk 阅读。在国家读书馆7楼的展览到11月30日为止， 不妨去看一看。

Also met Mr Tung Chee Hwa, the former Chief Executive of HK, and had dinner with the current CE CY Leung.

HK and Singapore share many similarities. We are both building for the future, while balancing the need to conserve our green spaces. HK is a thriving business and financial hub in Southern China. Singapore is doing well in Southeast Asia. We compete, but we also benefit from each others’ success.

DBS CEO Piyush Gupta was my moderator. We discussed opportunities in India, and how Singapore will change over the next 10 years.

One way to do this is to get agencies to work more closely together, to sort out municipal issues. As such, we will set up a new Municipal Services Office. It will coordinate the work of all the front-line agencies (LTA, PUB, NParks, etc) so they can serve people better. Another way to serve people better is to use technology to make Singapore a Smart Nation. PM will find another opportunity to talk about our plans.

a) how people can be allowed to take out part of their CPF  savings in a lump sum after the age of 65, subject to limits; 
b) how the Minimum Sum should be adjusted over time, so that members can continue to get an adequate basic retirement payout; 
c) how members can have more flexibility to invest their CPF savings; and
d) how CPF Life payouts can take account of cost of living adjustments.

The final Minimum Sum adjustment, scheduled for next year, will be $161,000 for those turning 55 from 1 July 2015. With a property pledge, you will only need $80,500 in cash.

总理说没有刻苦耐劳的建国一代，就没有今天的新加坡。 我们应该饮水思源，用一个恰当的方式，向建国一代表达我们的一份谢意。政府推出特别配套，希望能为建国前辈带来生活上的帮助。 
 
政府的另一大目标，是确保大家有足够的退休金，可以安享晚年。这个可以通过公积金制度和住屋政策两大政策来达到目的。总理说政府了解一些国人对公积金制度有一些见解，所以将调整公积金制度，使它更加完善，可以更好的帮助人民。总理说另一个能够保障国人晚年生活的政策就是居者有其屋政策。政府也会继续调整这些措施，尽量帮助国人利用房子来养老。总理将会在英语的演讲中进一步地解释这些政策。
 
总理也强调政府要让国人对未来充满信心和希望。无论国人处在哪一个起跑点，都有机会提升自己。在职场上一边工作，一边学习，也能出人头地。政府的教育目标，是要让人们按照自己的兴趣、专长和天赋，追求一个适合自己的学习道路，使自己的才华得到最充分的发挥。
 
要有好的生活，总理说，我们一定要有蓬勃的经济来进一步拓展国内和国际市场，特别是亚洲新兴的经济体，包括日益强盛的中国。政府会通过论坛促进新中企业交流，加深新加坡企业对中国的了解，促进新中两国创业者之间的合作。
 
总理说，新加坡华族，因为文化背景相近，以及具备双语能力，可以更容易融入中国社会。一直以来，政府也不遗余力支持民间组织，推广华族文化和母语教育。总理说，我们的宗乡会馆就做了很多工作，积极提倡文化和教育事业。政府会全力支持宗乡总会提出设立华族文化中心的构想。总理会在下个月为中心主持动土仪式。
 
华族文化中心所推广的文化，除了传统和现代中华文化，也将涵盖新加坡独特的华族文化。经过多年的酝酿，新加坡华族文化已经逐渐形成一种南洋风格。 
总理说，新加坡已经步入了第一世界，但是我们还没有发展到极限；我们还有无限发展的空间。我们需要的是先辈那种勇于开拓、积极进取的精神，新加坡才能攀上另一个高峰。

Dalam ucapan Bahasa Melayunya, PM telah mengulangi penghargaannya kepada golongan Perintis Melayu.

Encik Lee menekankan bahawa warga Perintis Melayu sebenarnya ada pilihan (samada untuk menyertai Malaysia atau kekal di Singapura) apabila Singapura Merdeka. Tetapi mereka memilih untuk jatuh-bangun bersama Singapura sehingga negara ini mekar menjadi sebuah masyarakat berbilang kaum dan agama yang unik – yang bersatu padu dan harmoni. Beliau mengulangi penghargaannya kepada golongan Perintis Melayu kerana yakin dengan masa depan Singapura dan bertungkus-lumus dengan kaum lain, membangunkan Singapura.

Salah seorang tokoh Perintis Melayu cemerlang yang disebut PM ialah Encik Yusof Ishak, Presiden pertama Singapura. PM mengumumkan 3 bentuk penghargaan sebagai menjunjung budi dan pengorbanan Encik Yusof kepada Negara:

Pertama, sebuah masjid baru di Woodlands akan dinamakan “Masjid Yusof Ishak”.

Kedua, Institut Pengajian Asia Tenggara bakal dikenali sebagai “ISEAS – Institut Yusof Ishak”. 

Ketiga, NUS akan memulakan “Kerusi Profesor Yusof Ishak dalam Sains Sosial”. 

Dalam ucapannya, PM turut menarik perhatian tentang kemajuan besar yang dicatat masyarakat Melayu/Islam sepanjang 50 tahun lalu. Ini ketara melalui contoh-contoh individu Melayu/Islam yang berjaya saban tahun. 

PM juga menarik perhatian tentang penekanan pemerintah untuk menghargai setiap individu berdasarkan sumbangannya dan bukan hanya kelayakannya. PM mengumumkan pembentukan Jawatankuasa ASPIRE yang akan bantu rakyat menggilap potensi mereka melalui pembelajaran sepanjang hayat dan latihan kemahiran khususnya buat pelajar ITE dan politeknik. Ini agar setiap rakyat berpeluang untuk majukan diri dan perbaiki kehidupan mereka.

Menggulung ucapannya, PM yakin masyarakat Melayu/Islam akan mencatat kejayaan demi kejayaan jika mereka terus bersatu-padu. PM menyeru agar masyarakat Melayu/Islam menjunjung semangat golongan Perintis, perkukuh masyarakat berbilang kaum kita dan memperteguh komitmen untuk membentuk Singapura yang lebih baik buat semua.

The loss of innocent lives is tragic and painful. The Middle East is far away, but still we empathise with the pain and suffering of the Palestinian people, because of our common humanity.
 
Alas there is no easy solution. The Israel-Palestinian problem goes back almost a century. The distrust and enmity are mutual, and deep. Yet there is no future in this endless cycle of violence and retribution. 
 
Any lasting solution must begin with restraint and an end to violence, by both sides. I hope all parties will work together to stop this latest episode of violence.

Some of my classmates are moving into the third age of their lives, becoming grandparents, enjoying retirement and giving time and energy to good causes. 
 
As the first junior college in Singapore, NJC had to overcome many challenges. I was reminded of the old Chinese saying 山不在高，有仙则名；水不在深，有龙则灵。It is not the external form that matters but the substance that counts. NJC still maintains that spirit today.

I joined the pioneer batch of students in their second year in 1970.  You could say I was a “pioneer generation” too (although the NJC pioneer students don’t qualify for the PGP)! :)

NJC exemplifies our efforts to keep paths upwards open to all, and to promote an open and egalitarian society. The college actively seeks out talented students from humble backgrounds, and has no affiliations to primary or secondary schools. It promotes a culture of moderation and restraint, so all students and staff feel comfortable and interact on equal terms with one another.

MPs generally supported the Government’s plans to improve people’s lives. But they had specific suggestions to help different groups of people. Some wanted more support for professionals, managers and executives (PMEs). Others suggested improvements to the CPF system to give older Singaporeans peace of mind in their retirement. Several urged more help for the lower-income and disadvantaged groups. We will look into these suggestions carefully.

Constructive politics is key to realising our dreams. The purpose of politics is to make a difference to people’s lives, to build a better Singapore. Politics purely for the sake of power, without any notion of what we want Singapore to become, will lead us to disaster.

This clip shows an exchange between Mr Low Thia Khiang and SMS Indranee Rajah on this important point.

The teams had to develop the fastest and most optimised mini-supercomputer. The participants needed many skills: computer design, engineering and coding.

125845680811480_703236646405711,"I came across this interesting piece about how the Chinese language is changing in China. People are using English words in spoken and written Chinese directly, without translating them into Chinese equivalents, or even transliterating them into similar sounding Chinese characters.  It is easier to say GDP than 国内生产总值, and Wifi is Wifi. 

This is causing controversy in China. Some think it is the practical thing to do – everybody knows what Wifi is, so why invent some unfamiliar Chinese term for the same thing? But others feel that the pure Chinese language is being polluted with foreign words. After all, some translations have been successful – Coca Cola 可口可乐 has a very appropriate meaning, and translating email into 电邮 is neat and succinct.

The same thing is happening to other languages too. If you listen to Malay spoken in Malaysia, or Tamil in India, you will often hear English words mixed in.

The reality is that a language is a live, changing thing. It constantly absorbs words, concepts and usages from foreign languages, so long as people are using it in their daily lives. Otherwise it becomes a dead language, studied by scholars but not spoken by ordinary people anymore, like Latin or Sanskrit.

We pay a lot of attention to languages in Singapore. We are doing our utmost to keep our mother tongues alive. These are live languages to be used, so we should accept that they will evolve and change over time. We need to speak and write them correctly, but also colloquially. Then we will really be cool, or as we say in Mandarin, 酷! :)

Dixie and I were from the same batch of MPs. We entered Parliament together in 1984. For many years before that, all the MPs had been male. Dixie, along with Dr Aline Wong and Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, were the only female MPs elected that year. They more than held their own, and stood out in the House.
 
Dixie was a hardworking MP who cared for her residents and spoke up for them in Parliament. She retired in 1991 to pursue a second career as a family and marriage therapist. She told me she derived great satisfaction from this. It was in keeping with her temperament and concern for others.
 
She was also an active volunteer. She founded the Association for Educationally Subnormal Children (later renamed the Association for Persons with Special Needs), and was Adviser to the Singapore Bank Employees’ Union. She received the Public Service Star for her community contributions, before she became an MP.
 
Dixie impressed with her quiet self-confidence, good sense, and gentle resolve. She spoke softly, but pressed with conviction for what she believed in. Although her sons had special needs, and needed her love and care, she was able to fulfil her public as well as family roles amply.
 
May Dixie rest in peace.

We must treat people in Singapore the way we ourselves expect to be treated overseas. Many Singaporeans live overseas, and are warmly welcomed in their adopted homes. I just attended our Singapore Day in London. How would we have felt if British netizens had spammed our website, and abused Singaporeans living in Britain?

We have passed Budgets that include major economic and social policies, including the Pioneer Generation Package, GST Vouchers, and Workfare enhancements. MPs have filed many questions to obtain information, press for actions, and solve their voters’ problems.

Parliament is where the most important national issues are debated and decided. Our sittings are not as fiery as some other legislatures, but the duty of government is to manage affairs responsibly and soberly, and not to create entertainment and excitement.

Singapore is in transition. We are adjusting to new domestic needs while navigating an uncertain international environment. When Parliament re-opens on 16 May, we will hear the President’s Address, and discuss strategies for creating a brighter future and a better Singapore for all. - LHL

The students had interesting perspectives on this Budget and shared ideas on what they would like to see next year.

I explained to them that the purpose of the Budget is to decide on where and how the Government is going to raise and spend its money for the year. 

This year, we had two main goals:

First, we want to grow our economy, to create more and better jobs for Singaporeans, and to give citizens more opportunities to upgrade themselves and improve their lives.

Second, we are building a fair and equitable society. The Budget contains schemes to help people afford medical treatment, public transport, education, housing, etc. It also recognises our Pioneer Generation through a special healthcare package (http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2014/pgp.aspx).

My thanks to all MPs for their active participation, and to ministers for working hard to listen, reassure, and explain. I am heartened by the general support for Budget 2014. 
 
Yesterday and today, Gan Kim Yong and Chan Chun Sing explained how we are strengthening social safety nets so that no one gets left behind. One key initiative is MediShield Life, which will cover every Singaporean, throughout his or her life.

Premiums for MediShield Life will be affordable for all, especially the elderly and the low-income. 
 
The Govt will bear most of the initial costs of universal coverage under MediShield Life. We will also introduce permanent subsidies for lower- to middle-income groups. For those who despite this help can’t afford their remaining share of premiums, Medifund will provide additional assistance. 
 
After all the subsidies, most households should be able to pay their MediShield premiums using just half of their Medisave contributions. 

Lower- to middle-income households should pay either the same or less premiums for MediShield Life as they are paying for MediShield today. 

The Pioneer Generation will be fine too. Effectively, those aged 80 and above today will have their premiums fully covered. Younger Pioneers (aged 65 – 79) on MediShield today will pay half of current premiums, but get better coverage. 
 
MediShield Life depends on everyone chipping in to share the burden, to take collective responsibility to protect one another. While MediShield Life gives us peace of mind for our health costs, let’s all do our part to stay healthy and avoid getting sick. This is the best way to keep health costs low, live long and live well.

Khaw Boon Wan shared plans to look into more ways for elderly residents to monetise their HDB flats, to support vulnerable families (e.g. divorcees with children), to enable more extended families to live near one another. MND had fewer cuts (items raised by MPs for discussion) this year than previous years, which hopefully shows that people are less worried about housing!

Lui Tuck Yew described what we are doing to reduce train disruptions, and cut waiting and travel time. We have bought more trains and will put more buses on the road, so as to service commuters better, especially during peak periods. 

Lawrence Wong announced plans to build more sports facilities all over the island, so that most Singaporeans will have sports facilities a short walk from home. The National Museum will have a new Wing, Play@NMS, dedicated to children and young families. We hope young Singaporeans will visit the Museum often, and grow up with fond memories of the Museum. (As I do – my grandmother used to regularly take me and my siblings to the National Museum. :) )

Vivian Balakrishnan announced an updated PSI index that takes into account PM 2.5 pollution, and an International Advisory Panel to advise the Government on what it can do about the haze under international law.

These are not easy issues, but if we continue working at them, we’ll continue improving our living environment and keeping Singapore a liveable city and an endearing home.

Mr Lee was a union leader of the Singapore Postal and Telecoms Employees Union. He had helped to found the union in 1947. 

During the postmen’s strike in 1952, he worked with Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who was the union’s legal advisor.

So when Mr Lee Kuan Yew launched the PAP in Nov 1954, Mr Lee Gek Seng was in the first pro-tem Central Executive Committee, and later served as Deputy Secretary General.

Mr Lee was a community leader for many years in Jalan Besar, and later in Toa Payoh. MPs he worked with included Mr Chan Chee Seng and Dr Lee Boon Yang.

I had just met Mr Lee at the Pioneer Generation Tribute at the Istana last month. He came in a wheelchair, but was clearly very happy to be there. Now he has left us.

We are tightening up on foreign workers, and helping businesses to improve productivity. It is not always easy for businesses to keep up, especially our small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). 

But we must press on. We are helping our businesses upgrade in practical ways. Here are some schemes we talked about in Parliament.

(Lim Hng Kiang) The Nanyang Additive Manufacturing Centre at NTU has the latest 3D printers which can print metal objects and even human tissue. It will do R&D projects together with businesses, to develop commercial applications for this technology.

125845680811480_670865602976149,"During the Budget debate, we always pay attention to local issues – healthcare, housing, public transport. But we must not lose sight of what is happening in the outside world, and how faraway events can affect us. Take for example the crisis in Ukraine, which Minister K Shanmugam Sc talked about in his speech yesterday (http://bit.ly/1e1SDg7). 

Ukraine is bigger than Singapore, but much smaller than its neighbour, Russia. For the last few months, the country has been in turmoil. Two weeks ago, President Yanukovich fled, and his pro-Russian government collapsed. Russian troops then intervened in the Crimea, a part of Ukraine that used to belong to Russia, and where Russia still has a naval base. 

If war breaks out in Ukraine, the global economy will be affected, and so will ours. We condemn any unprovoked invasion of a sovereign country, whatever the pretext. All countries, big and small, must observe international law. This is vital to a small country like Singapore. 

Russia is a nuclear power. Ukraine signed a treaty in 1994 with Russia, the US and UK to give up its nuclear weapons, in exchange for which the US and Russia agreed not to use force against Ukraine. Yet Ukraine is in this predicament today. 

The Ukraine crisis reminds us that small countries must defend themselves, and cannot rely solely on international treaties or the promises of others. That is why we must always maintain a strong SAF and Home Team. We must also have a capable MFA to strengthen our ties with friends and allies. Only then can Singapore be safe and secure.

They shared stories of their own parents or grandparents, who belonged to the special generation which built Singapore. They made useful suggestions to improve the Package and other Budget initiatives. We will consider their ideas carefully.

The govt can afford the Pioneer Generation Package because we have been careful with our finances. But govt spending is going up – on healthcare, infrastructure, and an ageing population. We are alright for the next few years. Beyond that, we must think about raising more revenues. 

We must never fall into the same hole as so many other countries, spending more than they earn, dragging down the economy and burdening future generations. If we keep our economy vibrant, and live within our means, we can continue providing assurance to all, while keeping ours a nation of opportunities. – LHL

Like quite a few others, he was born in Malaya, in his case Malacca, but came to Singapore to seek his future and make his home. While studying law in London, he met Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who was speaking to the Singapore and Malayan students there. Later he recounted what a profound impression Mr Lee made on him and his fellow students.

Mr Chua held several important appointments in the Cabinet from 1968 to 1984 – Health, Home Affairs, Education. As MP for MacPherson for 23 years, he groomed many grassroots volunteers, including several who have continued serving till today.

Mr Chua’s passing is a sad loss to us all. Our thoughts are with his family during this time of sorrow. – LHL

Hj Mohamed Ariff was a Legislative Assemblyman while we were in Malaysia, and then a Member of Parliament after we became independent. He served in Ulu Pandan and later Kampong Kembangan. Those were tumultuous times, with racial riots, and strong ethnic tensions. Because Hj Mohamed Ariff and the other PAP Malay leaders of his generation stood firm, and supported the PAP’s vision of a multi-racial Singapore, we were able to build the harmonious society that we have today.

When we held the Pioneer Generation Tribute event at the Istana a few weeks ago, I had asked if Hj Mohamed Ariff could come, but was told that he was unwell and could not make it. His passing marks another step in the passage of generations.

Our condolences to Hj Mohamed Ariff’s family. May he rest in peace. – LHL

Saya berdukacita dengan pemergian Haji Mohamed Ariff Suradi. Beliau tergolong di kalangan Generasi Pemimpin Perintis kita yang mengorak langkah untuk Singapura mencapai kemajuan dan kejayaan.

Hj Mohamed Ariff merupakan Anggota Dewan Perundangan ketika kita sebahagian dari Malaysia dan kemudian seorang Anggota Parlimen selepas kita merdeka. Beliau telah berkhidmat di Ulu Pandan dan kemudian Kampong Kembangan. Keadaan begitu getir ketika itu dengan rusuhan kaum dan hubungan antara kaum yang tegang. Namun berkat keteguhan Hj Mohamed Ariff dan para pemimpin Melayu PAP lain yang seangkatan dengannya, menyokong visi Singapura yang berbilang bangsa, kita mampu membina masyarakat harmoni yang kita nikmati hari ini.

Ketika kami mengadakan majlis menjunjung budi Generasi Perintis di Istana beberapa minggu lalu, saya bertanya jika beliau boleh hadir tetapi saya diberitahui beliau uzur dan tidak dapat hadir. Pemergian beliau adalah satu lagi petanda peralihan generasi.

The Budget gives specifics of the Pioneer Generation Package that I announced two weeks ago. These men and women made great sacrifices to build today’s Singapore. Now, it’s our turn to take care of them. 

There are enhanced schemes to help companies (especially SMEs) upgrade, adopt IT, and raise productivity.

Employer CPF contributions will go up, to help build up our Medisave savings. 

Healthcare will become more affordable. Lower- and middle-income patients will enjoy higher subsidies for outpatient care at polyclinics and specialist outpatient clinics.

We will give more support to disabled children and their families, through early intervention programmes. 

A GST voucher – Cash for Seniors, U-Save top-ups and S&CC rebates, will help households with the cost of living.

125845680811480_652043048191738,"Happy to be back in NTU to speak at the Ministerial Forum organised by the Students’ Union. With Singapore's 50th birthday around the corner, I shared with the students what I felt the future held for them and for Singapore, especially with the opportunities presented by a rising Asia and new technology breakthroughs.  The possibilities are limitless but so there will be challenges too, including to our social and cultural norms. 

I told the students that many of them would be here to witness Singapore's 100th anniversary. I asked them to think how they could make the most of their next 50 years. 

Some students I met are already making a difference, like Sally Yap, an NTU PhD student who is helping to develop a vaccine for malaria, and four Communication Studies students who’ve started The Real Reunion, a campaign to encourage families to bond over meals. Keep up your good work!  

To all who attended, thank you for your frank and lively views. Seize the day, and let’s work together to build a Singapore which we can all be proud of. Thanks too to NTUSU for inviting students from other universities to the forum. – LHL"

She came with her father, HRH Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. Now she is Thailand’s Ambassador to Austria and Permanent Representative to the International Organisations in Vienna, here as a Lee Kuan Yew Exchange Fellow. I wish her continued success and hope to meet her again soon. - LHL

125845680811480_650373518358691,PM Lee Hsien Loong bercakap kepada media di akhir sesi dialog dengan wakil masyarakat Melayu/Islam mengenai isu tudung pada 25 Januari 2014.
125845680811480_709476125781763,"The issue of wearing the tudung (headscarf in Malay) by Muslim women is an important matter for many Muslims in Singapore. This evening I met community and religious leaders, together with some Ministers and MPs, for a candid and fruitful dialogue. Snapped this pic of the participants at the end – all in good spirits! 

I told the group that I fully appreciate their desire to allow Muslim women in uniform to wear the tudung. But a larger issue is at stake: the sort of society we aspire to be. Singapore is a multi-racial, multi-religious and harmonious society. Minorities are fully integrated into the mainstream, but have full opportunities to maintain their identities and practise their faiths. So I am also mindful how crucial it is for us to strengthen our cohesion, and maintain the relaxed confidence and trust that benefits us all, especially the minorities.

On the tudung issue, the position is not frozen. Attitudes will shift and arrangements will get updated. We have gradually evolved over the last decade. Many statutory boards now have uniforms that allow Muslim staff to wear the tudung, e.g., LTA, NEA. In 5, 10 years’ time, I am confident that we will not be in the same situation as today.

It is best that we continue evolving gradually and carefully. The racial harmony we enjoy is not perfect, but it is more precious and more fragile than we think. Let’s work hard to strengthen it, so that all races can live happily together as one united people. – LHL

Isu tudung adalah isu penting bagi ramai orang Islam di Singapura. Petang tadi saya dan beberapa Menteri serta Anggota Parlimen telah bertemu dengan wakil-wakil masyarakat dan pemimpin agama. Perbincangan kami berlangsung secara terus terang, dan dari hati ke hati. Lihat gambar para peserta yang saya petik di akhir sesi – semuanya dalam semangat muhibbah! 

Saya tekankan kepada para peserta bahawa saya akur hasrat mereka untuk membenarkan wanita Islam di sektor seragam memakai tudung. Tetapi isu lebih besar harus difikirkan: Apakah bentuk masyarakat yang kita inginkan? 

Singapura adalah sebuah masyarakat berbilang bangsa dan agama yang harmoni. Kaum minoriti sebati dengan masyarakat lebih besar tetapi memiliki peluang sepenuhnya untuk kekalkan identiti dan amalkan agama masing-masing. Jadi saya sedar betapa gentingnya untuk memperkukuh ikatan kita bersama dan mengekalkan keyakinan dan kepercayaan yang mendatangkan manfaat untuk kita semua, lebih-lebih lagi kaum minoriti.

Dalam isu tudung, keadaan yang kita lihat hari ini tidak akan kekal begini. Sikap akan berubah dan dikemaskinikan. Sepanjang sedekad lalu, ada kemajuan yang bertahap dalam isu ini. Kini, banyak badan berkanun membenarkan kakitangan mereka memakai tudung bersama pakaian seragam misalnya LTA, NEA. Dalam 5, 10 tahun lagi, saya yakin keadaan akan berubah, tidak seperti hari ini. 

Sebaiknya kita terus bergerak secara bertahap dan berhati-hati. Sesungguhnya keharmonian kaum yang kita nikmati tidak sempurna, ia sebenarnya lebih rapuh dan berharga dari apa yang kita sedari. 

Ayuh kita berusaha gigih untuk memperkukuhkannya supaya semua kaum boleh hidup bersama-sama dengan selesa sebagai satu warga yang bersatu-padu. - LHL"

This was an isolated incident caused by an unruly mob. The vast majority of foreign workers here obey our laws. We must not let this bad incident tarnish our views of foreigner workers here. Nor should we condone hateful or xenophobic comments, especially online.

Visited the Ang Mo Kio Town Centre too. Caught up with residents and shopkeepers, some of whom have been here for decades! AMK has certainly been transformed over the years.

We last met in 2010 when I visited SIP, which has fulfilled all our expectations. He is an old friend of Singapore.

China’s reforms and development will create many opportunities for Singapore companies.

中国的改革发展给新加坡企业带来新机遇与挑战。因为要在中国市场立足，不单要跟中国公司比拼，也要经得起世界其他公司的竞争。因此我们必须掌握中国市场的动脉，并提升我们的华语和华族文化习俗的了解。通商中国的宗旨就是要为新加坡企业助一臂之力。大家齐心协力，希望能有卓越的成绩。

Many tweeted about stress in the education system (e.g. @Joshyy_Tingg, @RovinNation, @ShaeAtSix). Richard Chan and Benny Chee wrote about the need to do more in terms of values, ethics and social awareness. I understand these concerns. But we do need to study and work hard, to give ourselves the best start in life. We are making every school a good school, and providing every student with many paths through the education system. But there is a lot of competition to get into the most popular schools. Some competition is good, but too much becomes counter-productive. 

Students, parents and teachers must not lose sight of what education is about. Yesterday, Heng Swee Keat outlined MOE’s plans to continue providing values-driven, holistic education, to help every student achieve success in his own way, at his own pace (http://bit.ly/1bFvVO3). But whether this reduces stress depends also on our attitudes towards success and examinations. 

Several of you worried about housing affordability (e.g., @ZeeFriday, Zack Drz, Siu Lin). Housing is becoming more affordable, because we have increased grants for lower- and middle-income families, and are building more flats. We will track this closely and do more if necessary to keep HDB flats always within reach of Singaporeans.

@hpility asked if being Prime Minister is stressful. I suppose sometimes it is, just like any other job. But it is a great honour for me to serve. My team and I will continue to do our best to improve your lives. :)

125845680811480_573957802666930,"Sorry to learn of the passing of Tuan Haji Abu Bakar Maidin this evening.  As President of Jamiyah Singapore (a Muslim missionary society), Haji Abu Bakar was a stalwart of the Malay community. He devoted his life to the less privileged. Convinced that education was key to improving lives, he set up many education centres to develop young Singaporeans. 
 
Haji Abu Bakar also championed inter-religious harmony, and forged a strong partnership between Jamiyah and the Singapore Buddhist Lodge Foundation to help the needy. He was a role model not just for the Malay/Muslim community but for all Singaporeans.
 
Ho Ching and I offer our deepest sympathies to his family. - LHL

 
Dukacita dengan berita pemergian Tuan Haji Abu Bakar Maidin petang tadi. Sebagai mantan Presiden Jamiyah Singapura, Haji Abu Bakar merupakan antara tunggak masyarakat Melayu. Beliau gigih membela nasib golongan kurang bernasib baik. Mempercayai bahawa pendidikan adalah kunci untuk perbaiki kehidupan seseorang, beliau mendirikan banyak pusat pendidikan bagi membangunkan anak muda Singapura. 

Haji Abu Bakar juga memperjuangkan keharmonian antara agama dan menjalin kerjasama erat antara Jamiyah dan Singapore Buddhist Lodge Foundation untuk membantu golongan susah. Beliau menjadi contoh tauladan bukan sahaja untuk masyarakat Melayu/Islam bahkan juga bagi semua rakyat Singapura. 
 
Saya dan Ho Ching melahirkan rasa dukacita kami yang amat mendalam kepada pihak keluarga beliau. - LHL

125845680811480_562952703767440,"In his conclusion, PM said that all these are not merely plans but acts of faith – in Singapore and in ourselves: that a generation from now, Singapore will still be here; that we can thrive in the world and hold our own against bigger and stronger competitors; that we can get our politics right and have honest, capable, trusted people to lead our country well; that we can stay together as one united people and make our dreams come true.

PM called on Singaporeans to work with him and with one another. “Together, let us forge our new way forward, to create a better Singapore for all of us.”

125845680811480_562951300434247,"PM: We must pass on to our children a better Singapore than the one we inherited. We owe it to them to do so, just as we owe what we have today to our founding generation. PM said his responsibility is to help our young build the Singapore of their dreams: A Singapore with Opportunities, Purpose, Assurance, Community Spirit and Trust, a home where we celebrate our many talents, and above all, a society where the human spirit flourishes.

To realise these dreams, we need to do tangible things to build our city and improve our living environment. We are upgrading Changi Airport with a new complex codenamed Project Jewel, two new terminals and a fourth runway, to maintain our position as an international hub and create more opportunities for Singaporeans in future. We will move Paya Lebar Airbase to Changi. This will free up a big plot of land (bigger than Bishan or Ang Mo Kio) for new homes, offices, factories, parks and more in Paya Lebar. Relocating the airbase will also remove height restrictions on a large area around Paya Lebar, and allow us to redevelop eastern Singapore in new and exciting ways. The Government is also building a new port in Tuas and will move all container ports from Tanjong Pagar there eventually. This will free up prime land in Tanjong Pagar for a brand new Southern Waterfront City.
 
PM said these longer-term plans reflect our fundamental mindset and spirit – to be confident, to look ahead, to aim high. He said if we can carry off these plans, we will not have to worry about running out of space or possibilities in Singapore. We are creating possibilities and opportunities for the future, for our children and theirs to continue building, upgrading and reinventing our city for many more years.

125845680811480_562946360434741,"PM said the new policies in housing, healthcare and education are significant shifts, and part of our new way forward. But he emphasised that Government’s core purpose has not changed, and that is to ensure every Singaporean shares in the nation’s progress, to support the less fortunate and vulnerable, to create opportunities for Singaporeans to do their best, and to build a stronger Singapore. It will take some time to work out policies and programmes to realise the new balance between Government, Community and Individual, and Government will take further steps as we gain experience. 

PM stressed that the new strategic direction will take us down a different road from the one that has brought us this far. There is no turning back, PM said, but he believes this is the right thing to do given the changes in Singapore and the world. “We proceed. But let me sound a caution: All this is not without risk.” Hence, we have to tread carefully, and beware the pitfalls.

125845680811480_562944143768296,"PM stressed that the Community will have to do more to complement individual effort and Government programmes, and some have indeed shown that spirit during the recent haze crisis. 

PM was encouraged that many young people are doing good work. The Government will encourage more youths to build a better world and a better Singapore. A volunteer youth corps will be formed. The Govt will provide funding for youth corps members to start and do their own community projects. The youth corps will also match youths with critical community needs to help them make a meaningful contribution to our nation. “You are our future. Go forth, and change Singapore and the world for the better,” PM said.

125845680811480_562942403768470,"PM said the Government will create flexibility in secondary schools for students to tailor their education to their abilities and development. Secondary 1 students will be allowed to take a subject at a higher level if they have done well in that subject in PSLE. Secondary students who are strong in some subjects but not others can then learn each subject at a pace appropriate to them, and build their confidence. 

PM said it is good that we have outstanding schools in our system, but we need to keep admissions to these top schools open. These schools must not take just students with outstanding academic results but also very good students with other special qualities such as character, resilience, drive and leadership. They must make sure that those from low-income backgrounds are not put off from applying for fear they cannot afford it, or cannot fit in. MOE will broaden the Direct School Admissions scheme to do this, and enhance Financial Assistance and Bursary schemes substantially so that students who qualify and want to attend these schools can do so confidently.

The Government will introduce a Pioneer Generation Package to help this group of elderly pay for their premiums under Medishield Life. This will make sure they are well-covered and will not need to worry about healthcare in their old age.

125845680811480_562922693770441,"PM said that the Government will improve healthcare financing to give all Singaporeans peace of mind. It will provide more help with outpatient care. It will remove the age floor (currently 40) in the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) and increase subsidies for lower- and middle-income patients at Specialist Outpatient Clinics.

MediShield will be revamped to become MediShield Life. It will cover people for life (not up to 90) and be universal (covering every Singaporean, including those not currently covered, the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions). MediShield Life will also give better protection for very large bills. Because benefits and coverage are better, premiums will be higher. The Government will subsidise premiums for those who can’t afford it. MOH will conduct a public consultation exercise on this major change.

125845680811480_562920710437306,"PM emphasised that home ownership has been and will continue to be an important way to share the fruits of our progress with all Singaporeans, and to level up the poor. 

PM said he will make sure every Singaporean working family can afford an HDB flat - a family today earning $1,000 per month should be able to afford a 2-room flat; $2,000 per month a 3-room flat; and $4,000 per month a 4-room flat. Flat prices will be kept affordable so that people can use mostly CPF to pay off their loans, and have a 25 year loan instead of a 30 year loan.

Families in 2-room flats can look forward to more help to upgrade to 3-room flats later, as they improve their lives, through Step-Up Housing Grants. Lower- and middle-income households buying 3-room and 4-room flats for the first-time will also get more support – the Government will extend the existing Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG) to purchases of 4-room flats, extend it to middle-income households, and increase the SHG quantum.

PM: ""We will always make sure that an HDB flat is always within reach - affordable and available to Singaporeans.""

125845680811480_562915270437850,"PM said we must make a strategic shift in our approach to nation building. Individuals must still do their best, but the Community and Government must do more to reduce the pressures on individuals.

The Community must take more initiative to solve problems and get things done. As Mr S Rajaratnam, one of our founding fathers, said, we must be a “democracy of deeds, not a democracy of words”.

The Government will also do more to support individuals and community. It will make 3 important shifts: (1) Do more to give every citizen a fair share in the nation’s success, raise incomes and wealth of the low-income; (2) Strengthen social safety nets, so that whatever happens to you, you can get the essential social services that you need; (3) Do more to keep paths upwards open to all, by bringing every child to a good starting point, and ensuring the less privileged are not shut out.

125845680811480_562926000436777,"PM began his English speech recapping the OurSGConversation (http://bit.ly/1cJT4ij) process. He said the OSC has been a very meaningful exercise. “We have listened to one another and created a firmer, shared basis to discuss and plan our future.”

PM said that to achieve our aspirations, we need to take into account the world around us. He knows Singaporeans feel uncertain and anxious - technology and globalisation are widening income gaps, our population is ageing, and Singaporeans are worried about the cost of living, public transport, and other day-to-day problems.  PM said: I understand your concerns, and I promise you - you will not be facing these challenges alone because we are all in it together. We will find a new way to thrive in this new environment.

总理说我们应该再接再厉，延续成功的故事，使一代比一代好。我们也必须要有新的构想，新的策略，才能不断的进步。

总理说政府会继续帮助人民减轻压力，更在近几年推出了一系列社会措施来帮助中下层人民。政府已经推出的措施包括消费税补助券，就业奖励计划，特别就业补贴计划等措施来加强社会安全网，使老百姓的生活更有保障。除此之外，政府也非常关注中小型企业的困境，并强调政府正尽力帮助它们提升和转型。所以他希望企业和政府能多多沟通与对话。

这是政府的新理念、新思路。未来的几年，政府将沿着这个新思路走下去，使政策更贴近人民的意愿，更切合社会情况的改变。

总理强调我们必须调整政府、人民和民间团体三者之间的责任和角色，以取得一个新的平衡点。原本由个人承担的一些生活担子，现在由政府承担得更多，或者由民间团体分担。重新平衡政府、个人和民间团体的角色需要多年的努力，按部就班的进行。政府将先处理一些迫切的民生问题，包括教育、医疗保健和住屋，也会尽量减少人民所承担的生活风险，特别是医药费的风险。总理将会在英语的演讲中进一步地解释这些政策。

总理说我们必须做好扶贫济困的工作，以维持社会的凝聚力。其中，政府会尽力保持社会的流动性，通过教育的途径让每个阶层的人民都有机会提升，让人人都有机会能出人头地。政府也将确保较贫困的孩子能够处于更好的起跑点，而不会因为生活条件差落于人后。所以，政府去年决定大规模的资助幼儿所，托儿所，为中低收入家庭提供更多津贴，使他们的孩子得到良好的启蒙教育。在未来五年内，政府也计划增设两万个幼儿所名额。

除了援助比较贫困的家庭，政府将特别照顾较年长的新加坡人。政府会调整医药制度，为老年人制定一个特别配套，大大减轻他们的医药负担。

总理强调我们在处理问题的时候，也应该着眼未来，继续建设，寻求发展。他说华族根深蒂固的思想意识是 “前人种树，后人乘凉”，而现在是我们为后人种树的时候了。所以我们应该继续不断积累成就和资源，为子孙后代造福。

政府已在治国的理念上，做了重要的调整，并且已经根据新理念，重新制定民生政策。总理强调政府的目标是：不论贫富，人人受惠。而要做到这点，我们必须特别照顾生活比较困难的社群，尤其是低薪家庭和年长一代。总理承诺政府将全力以赴，也鼓励人民全力的支持和配合。

总理说人民可以期待明天会更好，因为政府就在新加坡人左右。

The economy is maturing and our population is ageing. Different groups in society have more diverse, even conflicting, interests. Older people worry about healthcare and costs of living. Younger ones aspire to wider education opportunities and more affordable homes. So we need to reassess our position, review our direction, and refresh our strategies. We have already started adjusting policies to achieve our goal: a fair and just society. 

Here are some videos on the changes in housing, education and healthcare. Thank you all for your suggestions over the past year, through OurSGConversation and other platforms. I look forward to speaking to you tomorrow. – LHL

Indonesia’s Environment Minister Prof Dr Balthasar Kambuaya promised Vivian that Indonesia would consider our offer and explore how to follow up on our suggestions.  

Meanwhile we are making sure that Singaporeans who need N95 masks can get them. Most of us don’t need to use masks, unless we have medical conditions like asthma, or have to do strenuous work outdoors when the haze is bad. We will distribute 1 million N95 masks free to low-income households, and push out more masks to retailers. There are enough masks – please do not panic buy or hoard. 

The Haze Inter-Ministerial Committee has also issued guidelines on what to do at each PSI threshold – please read them. (http://www.e101.gov.sg/haze/)

I’m heartened by the kindness of Singaporeans when faced by the haze. Some are distributing herbal tea and masks to needy residents, while others are opening up their air-conditioned homes to strangers! We will create more air-conditioned “haze shelters” in our RCs and CCs for the public.

We have already had 5,000 cases of dengue so far this year –more than the whole of last year. Public health inspectors are going round to check for mosquito breeding, but they need help. Thank you to the 30,000 volunteers in the Dengue Prevention Volunteer Groups!   

Each of us can do our part to reduce mosquito breeding and prevent dengue. Remember to change the water in vases, turn over water storage containers and cover bamboo pole holders that are not in use. Let's do the Mozzie Wipeout together, and protect our families! - LHL"

I have taken a personal interest in this matter, because it troubles me that our accident and fatal injury rates are higher than they could be. Every injury means pain and suffering for a worker, every death is a family distraught, bereft, and deprived of a breadwinner. It is our duty to reduce these to the absolute minimum, by instilling safety consciousness and safe work practices in workplaces.

Over the past decade, we have reduced the rate of fatal workplace injuries by more than half. We will continue to raise safety and health standards in our workplaces, to safeguard our workers’ well-being. I was happy to share our experience in my Message to the International Labour Organization (ILO) to commemorate World Day. – LHL"

Happy to make a side trip to visit our troops in Temburong. I first visited Temburong in 1982, before our present camp was built.

The events were on the other side of the world, but a good number of Singaporeans study or work in Boston. 18 Singaporeans participated in the Marathon. I am sure their families here were following events closely, and are greatly relieved that their loved ones are safe. 

Watching the news, I was inspired by the many stories of people behaving selflessly when facing fear and danger: spectators rushing to help victims instead of running away, healthcare workers working extra shifts to treat the injured, shopkeepers offering free food and drinks to comfort the public. Whatever our differences, we are all bound by a common humanity. 

The events this week remind us that we cannot take peace and security for granted, and must always remain vigilant. If ever Singapore encounters an incident like this, may we have the courage and the humanity to respond with the same grace and unity as the Bostonians. - LHL"

We will also focus on promoting social mobility, especially through education, so that children from less privileged backgrounds are not disadvantaged in our society.

The Catholic Church (Archdiocese of Singapore) is a key part of our diverse religious landscape. It has served the poor and needy of all faiths and races, provided excellent education and social services, and benefited many Singaporeans over the years. I have worked closely with Archbishop Nicholas Chia to promote religious harmony and understanding during his term as Archbishop, and thank him for his many contributions over the past 12 years. 

At the reception, Coadjutor Archbishop Goh explained to me his Coat-Of-Arms, which included his motto and other symbols that represent Singapore and the French Mission founding of the Catholic Church here. His Grace intends to lead the Church to continue contributing to a cohesive and compassionate society, peace and harmony in Singapore. 
 
I congratulate Coadjutor Archbishop Goh and look forward to working with him. I am confident that the Catholic Church and its 300,000 strong community will continue to flourish and make important contributions to Singapore under his leadership. - LHL

125845680811480_484765134919531,"Thoroughly enjoyed the Chingay Parade (妆艺大游行) this evening! 
 
Chingay is a highlight of our CNY celebrations. It is now a multi-cultural parade, comprising performances by Chinese groups as well as other ethnic and international groups. This year’s theme is “Fire in Snow”, which connotes resilience. 

I see resilience in many Singaporeans - people who have encountered misfortune or survived cancer, people born with special needs who have overcome them to excel, people who push themselves to achieve daunting challenges. Many such Singaporeans joined the finale of the Parade tonight. Their grit and determination make them special, and make Singapore special. Resilience is a vital part of the Singapore spirit. 
 
A big thank you to the many Parade performers and volunteers, who have practised very hard for many months. I enjoyed chatting with several of them after the parade (including several from Teck Ghee). You can still catch the Chingay parade (http://www.chingay.org.sg/) tomorrow or watch it on Channel 8 this Sunday, from 8pm onwards. - LHL

It was a special occasion, because both have been with GIC since it was first formed in 1981. They have contributed much to Singapore – overseeing and managing our reserves through booms and crashes, growing them steadily year by year, and mentoring generations of younger officers. 

Richard was the first private sector member of the GIC Board. After he retired from Shell Singapore, he became the Managing Director of GIC (and MAS concurrently), before serving as Finance Minister. He continued serving on the GIC Board even after he retired from politics. He was widely respected for building up GIC and for his humble and fair disposition. 

Kok Song was GIC’s Chief Investment Officer. He was a key person, almost an institution, in GIC. He could have done well for himself elsewhere, but chose to stay in GIC because he found meaning and satisfaction in working for the nation, for a greater cause than a typical bank or fund manager. Besides his work in GIC, Kok Song also chaired the Wealth Management Institute and served on the Singapore Labour Foundation.

Many others like Richard and Kok Song work quietly out of the public eye, making Singapore a better place for us all with their talents and energies. They deserve our support and gratitude.

In 2012, we served nearly 2,800 residents (many of whom came more than once) and wrote over 5,500 letters of appeal, or more than 100 letters per week. Just under half the cases live in Teck Ghee itself, while the rest were from other parts of Ang Mo Kio GRC. More than half were older residents (aged 46 or older). Half live in 3-room flats, mirroring the housing profile of our estate. But I had a sprinkling (3%) from private estates too – these residents are generally able to handle problems themselves, though once in a while they too find they need their MP.

The most frequent appeals (more than a third) concerned housing, e.g. buying/selling flats or requests for rental flats. HDB has a tough job, but it is making progress building more BTO flats and shortening waiting times for rental flats. 

Other common appeals were for financial assistance (14%, including social assistance, or help with paying bills), followed by immigration matters (12%, including citizenship & PR, employment or social visit passes), and traffic/parking issues (9% of letters, mostly appealing against summonses). Education appeals (4%) popped up seasonally, especially during school or university / poly / ITE admissions season. 

Fortunately, we encountered not many requests for help to find jobs (3%) reflecting our low unemployment. Nor were there were many requests for help with medical bills (only 82 cases throughout the whole year, less than 2%), though I know that people worry a lot about healthcare costs and we will continue to monitor them closely. 

We always seek to give residents a full and sympathetic hearing, and to help them as best as we can. Even if we can’t fully solve all their problems, we can often at least lessen them. I always feel encouraged when residents come to thank us, like this one who brought me a special thank you card. I had written for Mr Koh Chek Heng to NUH a few weeks ago, and obtained a medical report which he needed to show to several government agencies. – LHL"

But PSLE is far from the only thing which counts. Our students must also develop good moral values, strong social skills, and a sense of duty to our families and nation. These are not in the PSLE syllabus, but they are important to a fulfilling and productive life.

I hope you do well in your studies, whichever school or stream you attend. Your schools and teachers will nurture you, and develop your talents. Our education system offers you many pathways and opportunities. Make the most of them. Study hard, but also make time to play and pursue your passions. May you find your own paths to success and happiness. – LHL"

Member countries are individually quite small in the global scheme of things. Hence we need to work together, despite our different situations and perspectives, to thrive in an uncertain world. 

One key event was the launch of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The RCEP will be a free trade area that links up all 10 ASEAN members and 6 ASEAN dialogue partners. This will cover nearly half the world's population and a third of the world's GDP.

We appreciate US President Obama’s strong support, visiting ASEAN on his first trip after re-election. For Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, this has been their last ASEAN meeting. We thank them for their support and wish them all the best. – LHL"

It houses research labs from ten leading R&D institutions including MIT, Technical University of Munich, ETH (Switzerland), and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

CREATE is a “collaboratory”, which makes it easy for the different teams to work with one another and with our own universities and research institutions. Hopefully these interactions will spark creative insights and new discoveries, and help us build and root a well-integrated R&D eco-system in Singapore. 

Also launched the second National Innovation Challenge (NIC). An NIC is a way for us to focus research on a big and complex challenge facing Singapore. This NIC, on “Land and Liveability”, will study how we can create new space, e.g. by building underground, and how we can use our existing space more creatively. Then our economy can grow, and we can all enjoy a highly liveable city. – LHL"

Auntie Annie was a devout Catholic, who attended mass every day. The last time I met her was at a Commissioning Parade in SAFTI about 10 years ago, when one of her grandsons graduated from OCS.

I have only watched one of the Star Wars movies myself (Episode III: Revenge of the Sith), but I hope that Singapore can benefit from this.

This special friendship has endured and deepened. One area of cooperation is defence. Generations of SAF servicemen have done jungle training at Temburong, climbing Mount Biang and crossing Sungai Batu Apoi. Singapore and Brunei work together in many other areas too.

I wrote an op-ed to capture these longstanding ties. Will share more tomorrow. :-) – LHL"

We have been promoting healthy lifestyles for 20 years. We have made progress – more people are exercising, fewer are smoking and Singaporeans are generally more conscious of staying fit and healthy. But unfortunately more people are becoming obese, with fast foods and sedentary occupations. In the US and UK, obesity has become an epidemic. If we don’t want to end up like that, we need to watch what we eat and find ways to exercise more. 

For myself, I enjoy brisk walks and also swim to keep fit. I take the stairs rather than the lift whenever I can. Every little bit counts. Why not try the Health Promotion Board’s new online tool -- the Healthy Lifestyle Index (www.healthylifestyleindex.sg) – for some personalised advice on how you can improve your health! :) - LHL"

125845680811480_429324763796902,"Selamat Hari Raya Haji or Salam Aidiladha to our Muslim friends here and abroad!

Today marks the end of the Haj (pilgrimage), one of the five pillars of Islam. Millions of Muslims have gathered in the holy city of Mecca. Unfortunately, this year Saudi Arabia accepted fewer pilgrims, as it is redeveloping the area around two Holy Mosques. Singapore’s Haj quota was also reduced, even though I wrote to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to request more places. I hope that those who were unable to go this year will get the chance to do so before too long.

Muslims also perform the Korban (sacrifice) today, to celebrate Prophet Ibrahim’s faith in God. Min Yaacob Ibrahim and I were initially quite worried that our Korban ritual might be affected by Australia’s stringent new regulations on live sheep exports. Fortunately 16 mosques passed the Australian audits, and were able to import 2,500 sheep for the ceremony. 

When I met Australian PM Julia Gillard in Canberra recently, I thanked her for her government’s help on this matter. She told me that her government wants to continue exporting live animals. But I know that Australian animal welfare groups are pressing strongly to ban live exports completely, as New Zealand has done. We should be prepared for this possibility, and work out alternative arrangements in future.

I wish all Muslims well during this holy day. – LHL

Salam Aidiladha kepada semua umat Islam Singapura!

Semasa musim haji ini, jutaan umat Islam dari seluruh dunia berkumpul di kota suci Mekah. Malangnya, tahun ini, kerajaan Arab Saudi menghadkan bilangan jemaah dari luar negara kerana projek pembangunan semula di kawasan Tanah Suci. Kuota haji Singapura juga turut terjejas, walaupun saya telah menulis kepada Putera Mahkota Arab Saudi untuk merayu kuota tambahan. Saya berharap bahawa mereka yang tidak dapat menunaikan haji mereka tahun ini akan mendapat peluang untuk berbuat demikian tidak lama lagi.

Hari ini juga umat Islam mengerjakan korban untuk memperingati ketaatan Nabi Ibrahim kepada Tuhan. Saya dan Menteri Yaacob Ibrahim pada mulanya khuatir ibadah korban akan terjejas tahun ini sempena peraturan pemerintah Australia yang lebih ketat ke atas eksport binatang. Mujurlah, 16 masjid lulus pemeriksaan audit Australia dan berjaya mengimport 2,500 ekor kambing untuk dikorbankan.

Ketika bertemu PM Australia Julia Gillard di Canberra baru-baru ini, saya mengucapkan terima kasih kepada beliau atas bantuan pemerintah beliau mengenai perkara ini. Dia memberitahu saya bahawa pemerintah Australia mahu terus mengeksport ternakan hidup. Namun, saya tahu bahawa kumpulan-kumpulan hak asasi haiwan telah menggesa pemerintah Australia supaya mengharam sepenuhnya eksport ternakan hidup seperti apa yang dilakukan oleh New Zealand. Kita perlu bersedia menghadapi kemungkinan ini dan mencari alternatif jika ia berlaku.

Saya ingin mengucapkan yang terbaik bagi semua umat Islam pada hari suci ini. – LHL"

A fair share were residents with housing problems. But the root cause is family breakups. One resident I saw was locked out of his marital home years back, recently divorced, and has transferred the flat to his ex-wife. Another recent divorcee is having to sell her flat, leaving her and her teenage daughter to fend for themselves, with no other relatives here to fall back on. Both asked me for HDB rental flats. I often receive such messages through Facebook too.

Family breakups lead to so many other problems: housing, financial difficulties, custody of children, etc. MPs do our best to help, and HDB is building more rental flats. But ultimately the family members have to work things out themselves, and ideally avoid breaking up in the first place. That's why strong families are so important. – LHL"

Entitled “Sins of Their Founders”, the piece reviews a book on the civil war in Sri Lanka. The civil war started in 1983, but as Dhume pointed out its roots go back to the country’s independence in 1948. Instead of embracing an inclusive view of citizenship, Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) marginalised the Tamil minority. The Tamil revolt was led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, a brutal guerrilla leader. The bloody conflict killed tens of thousands, and set the country back many years. Now that it is over, I hope Sri Lanka can enjoy lasting peace and stability.

Dhume noted that Singapore took a different path, with a different result. We are fortunate that right from the birth of our nation, our founders upheld multi-racialism and equal opportunity as the fundamental basis for our society. Thus we have maintained harmony between the different races and religions all these years.

Singapore’s high standards of integrity are hard-earned and crucial. Anyone who gives or takes bribes will be caught and punished, no matter how senior he is. Far better for the government to suffer embarrassment and keep the system clean, than to pretend that nothing has gone wrong, and let the rot spread. 

To keep our system corruption free, political leaders must lead by example, the public service must strengthen its culture of probity, and Singaporeans must continue to reject corruption.

Now after every event, writing an FB post and choosing pics to share with fans have become habits. I appreciate your wall comments and private messages, which help me understand your hopes and concerns. Your Likes and Shares too tell me what posts struck a chord with you, and what I should post more about.

Today I met 19 of my fans and followers over tea. You came from many backgrounds and age groups (Jiajia was the youngest :) ), and some of you are more active online than others (mrbrown, Dr JiaJia Big Brother, Ming Shen). 

We talked about many issues, from Twitter and Reddit (President Obama just did an Ask Me Anything session today, and crashed the servers), to online behaviour (some favoured requiring real names, some didn’t), and Singapore’s declining birth-rate (no magic solutions, alas). Thank you also for your feedback on my Facebook page.

I value your ideas on how to give our young hope of a brighter future, how we can be a gracious, big-hearted people, and how to make Singapore the best home for us all. 

This is a major effort. That is why we need to have a national conversation on Our Singapore, and to work together to realise our ambitions. I’ll be holding more discussions in the weeks ahead, and look forward to a constructive dialogue. Let us come together to create a Home with Hope and Heart in our future Singapore! – LHL"
125845680811480_394771240577135,"At the National Day Rally on Sunday, I said that it is good for young children to play and learn through play. We should not force feed our kids, and turn pre-school into a prep course for Primary One. I am glad that many parents and educators have agreed with me. I hear that “No homework is not a bad thing” became the most re-tweeted tweet from my Twitter account (maybe by pupils :))!

This article gives an idea why this is so, and describes how children will gain much more (educationally) through playing games and fun activities, than through drills and rote learning. - LHL"

125845680811480_405444602851585,"Concluding the Rally with stories of Singaporeans and his own personal anecdotes, PM said that it is our shared memories as Singaporeans that define the Singapore story for all of us. He rallied Singaporeans to work together to create a better Singapore, where we look to our shared future with confidence and Hope, where we treat one another with a big Heart and where we build for our children and grandchildren our best Home."
125845680811480_405441749518537,"PM said Singapore must be a Home where we feel a sense of belonging, and take pride in what we’ve achieved together and what we stand for. Singapore also has to be a home where people want to get married, have children and bring up the next generation. 

Unfortunately, total fertility rate has been falling steadily. But PM said we cannot give up.

The National Population and Talent Division is consulting the public widely on the marriage and parenthood issue before deciding what needs to be done. The ideas the Government is looking at include better work-life balance, flexible work arrangements, priority housing for couples with young kids, paternity or shared maternity leave, defraying childhood medical expenses, better pre-school, childcare and infant care, and improving the baby bonus."
125845680811480_405437302852315,"PM: Singapore of the future must have a bigger Heart. He gave several examples of how we have built a harmonious society through mutual respect and a spirit of give-and-take. Most Singaporeans are big-hearted and generous, and more are donating to charitable causes. But he added that a minority seemed to be less tolerant towards others, and urged Singaporeans not to allow this trend of not-so-good behaviour to spread. 

On relations between Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans, PM said it was fair for people to express concern or to disagree with immigration trends and policies, but he was worried by some of the nasty views expressed, especially online and anonymously. This, he said, speaks poorly of who we are and damages our international reputation. 

He urged Singaporeans to show a generosity of spirit to one another, including toward new arrivals. He urged new arrivals to also make the effort to embrace our values, commit themselves to Singapore and integrate into our community."
125845680811480_405432686186110,"PM said this year’s Inclusive Budget was a major shift to set a new strategic direction in our social policy. There were significant initiatives for the elderly, low and middle-income and the disabled. 

Looking ahead, PM said that as Government spends more on social services, taxes must go up – not immediately, but certainly within the next twenty years. PM stressed that safety nets have to be coupled with self-reliance and resilience. He also urged those who have succeeded to help others succeed too."
125845680811480_405430522852993,"PM said quality of pre-school education has to be substantially raised, while keeping pre-school affordable, especially for middle- and lower-income households. 

Hence, the Government will invest substantial resources in pre-school and play a more active role. It will establish a new statutory board to oversee the sector but will not nationalise the sector. MOE and MCYS will study this.

PM also cautioned parents against “over-teaching” pre-school children and said having no homework is not a bad thing. It is good for young children to play and learn through play, he said."
125845680811480_405427626186616,"PM said the Government is opening up more paths in higher education. It will increase full-time places for applied degrees. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and SIM University (UniSIM) will be made Singapore's fifth and sixth universities. This will increase current full-time university intake, and enable 40% of each cohort to go to university by 2020, up from 27% today. 

Government will also give more support to part-time students. Besides making more part-time places available, Government bursaries and loans will be extended to UniSIM part-time students, so that they get the same support as part-time students in NUS and NTU. MOE will announce details later."
125845680811480_405423709520341,"PM said the Government is making major investments in the MRT system, spending $60b over 10 years. But train projects take time to complete. So, the Government is also working on Bus Services Enhancement Programme. Commuters should start to see new services and better frequencies by next month.

On healthcare, PM noted that new hospitals are being built - Ng Teng Fong Hospital in Jurong and another in Sengkang. The Government plans to build more nursing homes and day care centres but PM was quick to add that the best and cheapest healthcare is to keep fit and live healthily.

PM also said the Government knows the concerns of singles who can only buy from the resale market but not directly from HDB. He said that MND is looking into this issue."
125845680811480_405420929520619,"PM began his English speech by asking Singaporeans where they want Singapore to be 20 years from now. Much will depend on what we make of our resources and what we want Singapore to become, he said.

PM has asked Minister Heng Swee Keat to lead a national conversation on this. He urged Singaporeans to think about our future, contribute ideas and work together to make it happen.

PM then went on to say Singapore must always offer Hope of a better future."

努力发展经济，也积极建立更温馨、更优雅的社会

新加坡近50年来取得巨大的发展，我们已经告别了快速发展的阶段，现在必须寻找一条新的发展策略。我们要继续发展和进步，我们的社会必须保持朝气，也必须有一种前瞻性的思维，并且为年轻一代制造施展才华的空间。当然，我们也应该照顾年长一代，帮助他们应付环境的改变，我希望年长一代也能保持身心活跃，尽量做到自力更生。

我鼓励新加坡人自我更新，但也希望大家保留文化的根，宗乡总会今年初提出设立“新加坡华族文化中心”的构想。福建会馆最近也提出开办“福建会馆文化学院”的建议。政府支持这两项计划，希望它们能够开创新的文化天地。

Beliau menyeru agar kita terus berusaha untuk meningkatkan pembangunan masyarakat Melayu/Islam, supaya kita dapat maju bersama sebagai satu bangsa. 

Sambil memberi beberapa contoh belia yang cemerlang, beliau juga mengatakan bahawa para belia Melayu/Islam telah menunjukkan prestasi yang baik dan mengikut jejak langkah pemimpin masyarakat yang berjaya.

PM menambah bahawa pemerintah akan menyokong usaha masyarakat Melayu/Islam untuk meningkat maju, termasuk usaha mengekalkan budaya Melayu, tetapi masyarakat harus manfaatkan sepenuhnya sokongan itu. 

Demi memastikan masyarakat Melayu/Islam akan terus menjalani transformasi, dan meningkat ke tahap yang lebih tinggi, PM juga mengingatkan bahawa selain membimbing golongan yang berkebolehan, kita juga harus bantu mereka yang susah, dan galakkanlah yang sederhana supaya meningkatkan prestasi.

Mr Wong spoke about the importance of creating opportunities, improving Singaporeans’ quality of life and building stronger communities. Referring to the ideals expressed in the pledge, he urged Singaporeans to work actively with the Government to achieve happiness, progress and prosperity for our nation. 

Madam Halimah spoke on the need to ensure that a widening income gap does not make it harder for Singaporeans to excel. She emphasised the importance of maintaining social mobility, and said the Government is committed to doing more for those who need help. 

Minister Heng highlighted the need for a national conversation about “Our Singapore”, for Singaporeans to come together, and ask: What matters most? Where do we want to go as a country, as a people?

Come November, we will restructure MCYS and MICA into three new ministries – the Ministry of Social and Family Development; the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth; and the Ministry of Communications and Information. We want to focus sharply on three priority areas: (1) Strengthening families and social safety nets; (2) Promoting arts and sports, building social capital and engaging the young; and (3) Improving public communications and engagement.

Quite a few of you felt that I should talk about population issues, including integration with new arrivals (e.g., Yap Fred, Qi Yong, Jessica.Chan) and parenthood (e.g., Suresh Kumar, Sherin Tan, February Amethyst). This is an important and difficult problem. We have just published an Issues Paper “Our Population, Our Future” (http://www.population.sg), which explains our demographic challenges and what we aim to do about them. Do take a look at it. 

Other readers suggested cost-of-living (e.g., Peter Cheng, Jasmine P'ng Siok Lee), education (e.g., Steven Ooi, James Phoon), and housing (e.g., Yusoff Yb, Sean Lim). These are all issues preoccupying many Singaporeans. 

I will definitely bear your suggestions in mind as I work on my National Day Rally speeches. Unfortunately I can’t cover all the subjects you have proposed. But many of them are on our national agenda, and being attended to. 

I have Liked quite a few of your comments, including those disagreeing with the government or voicing your concerns. Do continue to post your comments and views. We can all benefit from a constructive and civil debate on national issues.

This year marks 45 years of NS. More than 900,000 men have completed this rite of passage, and NS has become a vital national institution.

I remember when I was called up in 1971, and was a recruit in ‘A’ Company, 2 SIR, at Holland Road Camp. The facilities were basic, the equipment often incomplete. We did not even have steel helmets for everybody. We were issued only the inner liners covered with camouflage nets, except when we went to the firing range.

When it came to my sons’ turn to be called up, my wife and I went with them to BMTC at Pulau Tekong. I met many other parents, who had similarly done NS themselves. We (the fathers) all ooh’d and aah’d over the barrack rooms, the cupboards and mattresses, and of course the cookhouse food. We told our sons about the old days, but I am not sure how impressed they were.
 
Long after we have finished NS, the bonds and friendships remain. Last Sunday, at the Singapore Youth Awards (SYA) Presentation Ceremony, someone came to say hello. He had served under me in 23 SA in 1980, as a gunner. Now he was on the SYA panel choosing the awardees. We were so happy to meet again.
 
Thank you to all our servicemen, regular and NS, for safeguarding our peace, security and progress! Thanks also to all the families and employers, for your support and understanding!

AMP produced a good report outlining the progress made, and its proposed strategies for the next 10 years. I encouraged AMP to maintain its focus on educational, social, and economic issues.

These two retirees, old friends of each other, have lived in Woodlands for 40 years. They used to work for the Royal Navy.

Getting our population and integration policies right is crucial to our social cohesion, economic wellbeing and sense of belonging. This is why we are encouraging discussion and dialogue on this difficult problem.
 
We have to recognise the human and emotional reactions that people understandably feel when they see our society changing. We must also acknowledge our economic and demographic realities – our need for enough workers and more talent, as well as our shortage of babies and aging population. Only then can we anticipate the challenges, and address the problems comprehensively.

We will do our utmost to help all citizens through education and upgrading. We will also strengthen our social safety nets.

Our trade with Guangdong province is large and growing.

Mr Wang Yang proposed building a long term relationship between Singapore and Guangdong, and I was happy to agree.

Having made great economic progress, Guangdong must now tackle social issues. As Mr Wang Yang put it: when people were poor and hungry, the government concentrated on growth; but now that basic needs are largely met, new aspirations have arisen. He came to see how Singapore has dealt with the social side of things. I shared what we have done on housing, healthcare, education and community development, and how in Singapore too as old problems are solved, new issues have arisen.

Back in 1999, Ezra arranged for me to spend a few weeks in Harvard, meeting professors and students interested in Asian affairs. 

Over dinner we talked about his recent book, and about developments in China. He sees the enormous progress that China has made, and the major challenges that lie ahead. He is convinced, as we are, that a stable, prosperous China will be a great plus to the world.

125845680811480_357948324267880,"My previous post on the call centres in the Philippines attracted many thoughtful comments, which I have read with great interest.

As several readers pointed out (e.g. Aaron Quek, Eric Lee, Melvin Chen), I was not suggesting that Singapore should aim to attract call centre jobs, or compete with the Philippines on the basis of low wages. We have gone well past that phase of development. Furthermore, our fundamental aim is to improve the wages of our workers, not join in a race to the bottom. My point was that many jobs which used to be done in the developed countries are gradually migrating to lower-cost providers around the world, such as call centres in the Philippines. This global trend will affect us too.

The Filipinos will not stop at call centres. They are already moving on higher value-added services such as animation for movies and video games. India has upgraded from running call centres to hosting higher-end business process outsourcing (BPOs), e.g. providing professional services such as legal advice and filing tax returns for Americans, at a fraction of the cost of American lawyers and accountants. 

As more and more services are “crowdsourced” at the click of a mouse, Singaporean workers will face growing competition. Not just in unskilled and low-paid jobs, but white-collar jobs too; and not just from foreign workers here, but from workers and professionals thousands of miles away in other countries. 

This is why, although we want our workers to earn more, we cannot simply push up Singaporean wages as we would like. Globalisation and technology make this impossible. We will watch the inflow of foreign workers, so that Singaporeans don’t get overwhelmed. But in the long term, the only way for our workers to do better is to compete on knowledge and innovation, upgrade our skills, and stay ahead of the pack. We also have to continue welcoming talent, to boost our competitive edge. This is not easy to do, but the Government will walk this journey with Singaporeans every step of the way.

Our economy is doing quite well, and unemployment is very low. But I know workers are concerned about issues like the cost of living, our low-wage workers and our ageing workforce. We are tackling these tough issues directly. 

At the same time, we must get our overall strategies right. Singapore needs to stay open and connected to the world, as a society and a people. It is the only way for a small country to progress and prosper. 

Second, our economy must grow. Not simply by expanding, but by upgrading ourselves, raising productivity and creating better jobs for all. This will give us the resources to build a better Singapore. 

Third, all Singaporeans must share the fruits of growth. In particular, we must do our best to help low-wage workers. This is how we build an inclusive society which leaves no Singaporean behind.

125845680811480_391261257575265,"Just returned from AMK. Was at a Welcome Party at Teck Ghee Vista, and an MUP Completion at Teck Ghee Grandeur. 

A warm welcome to all my new residents! Hope you enjoy your new homes. I liked the mural “My Heartland Memories” in the rooftop garden, done by 50 families working together.

Teck Ghee Grandeur is the final MUP project in HDB’s programme. Visited one Malay family with three kids, and an extended Chinese family living in two flats on different floors. Both were very pleased with the improvements to their flats, and neighbourhood.
