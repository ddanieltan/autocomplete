Garuda, the mythical half-eagle, half-human creature, is one of those interesting features of Hindu legend that can be found all around Asia. It was absorbed into Buddhist tradition, which is how it made its way to China and Japan. And through both Hinduism and Buddhism, it came to Southeast Asia. The Garuda is today the national emblem of both Indonesia and Thailand. 

It became part of Indonesia’s local traditions from ancient times, and was chosen as the symbol of Pancasila, Indonesia’s unifying national ideology after it gained independence. In Thailand, Garuda was the symbol of royalty for centuries. A less well known fact: the Garuda is also the official symbol of Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, where it is called Khan Garuda.

It’s just another example of how our Asian traditions were woven into each other. Each of our cultures is distinct, with its own beliefs, practices and colours. But every culture has in fact borrowed extensively from others over the centuries. 

Garuda, which comes from the Sanskrit language, became Karura in Japanese Buddhism and art. In Thailand it became Khrut, in Cambodia Kruth. In both countries, like in Indonesia, Garuda refers to the half-eagle creature that fought evil and carried the god Vishnu, drawing from the epic Mahabharata story. 

A bit more information for those who are interested. Garuda is actually one of the three half-animal deities in Hindu mythology that found their way into many  Asian societies, as cultures flowed into each other. The other two are Ganesh, the elephant-headed deity, and Hanuman, the monkey god. (Ganesh is better known as Vinayaka amongst Buddhists.) 

The photo shows a Javanese version of Garuda, which people are more familiar with in our part of the world."

Muslim volunteers perform the sacrificial slaughtering of sheep at our mosques after the congregational prayers in the morning. The meat is distributed to relatives, neighbours and especially the needy. It's a reminder to share one's blessings with others.

The Malay name that we use for this holiday, Hari Raya Haji, comes from the fact that it occurs on the culmination of the Haj, or pilgrimage to Mecca. The Tamil Muslims say Haji Perunāl. The Arabic name refers to the act of sacrifice - Eid al-Adha, or Feast of the Sacrifice. Locally too, it is now common to say Hari Raya Eiduladha."

I have met few people who lived and breathed Singapore the way he did. His fondness for friends of every race and from all walks of life.  His complete absence of airs. His love of food. And his remarkable memory of events in our history, small and big, and of everyone he had met along the way. 
 
He was active to the end, and never lost his human touch. Just in the last few months, he was sending letters to me and others with his sharp observations and advice on various issues, and always in his beautiful hand-writing.  When I last saw him at his home, for lunch, he was in a mellow mood. He had recalled that I had liked the sambal udang the last time we had lunch, and made sure it was served again.

496904023672427_1372505902778897,"“I just used to giggle and found that I really liked being in the water.” That’s how it all started, when Colin and May Schooling pushed their 3-year old Joseph under water to get him to learn how to tread water. They also got Vincent Poon to coach him. He taught Joseph to swim, to be fearless, and as Colin Schooling recalls, to have the hunger to win. Vincent himself remembers how, when Joseph started winning easily, he made him start 10 seconds after the others, and to race against bigger kids  - so that he would sometimes lose, and had to fight harder. But Vincent’s own life story is also something.
 
Vincent taught himself to swim when he was six – in the early 1950s -  at our first public pool - the old Mount Emily swimming pool. When he went to Beatty Secondary School, he became the swimming team captain. Later, he received a long-distance swimming award – he swam more than 20km, non-stop over 12 hours. Vincent was also a serious judoka, obtaining a black belt (second dan). Unfortunately he got seriously injured in a road accident, which gave him a permanent limp. So he decided to become a swimming coach. He read up, taught himself the training techniques, and began coaching at the old Royal Naval Officers’ Club in Woodlands in 1964. Later he moved to Farrer Park Swimming Pool and then Tanah Merah Country Club.
 
Vincent Poon is still coaching at 70. He told The Sunday Times that his heart was beating faster and faster while waiting for Joseph’s finals on TV yesterday. 

His story carries the Singapore spirit.  Find something that we can each be good at. Persevere over the years. Then pass the passion on to the next generation.
 
So from parent to teacher to student, we keep discovering talents in Singapore, give everyone hope, and support them on their own journey of excellence, each in their own way. Who knows, we may even create more Joseph Schoolings.

Joseph has unusual athletic ability, physical and mental. But he also put huge effort over the years to achieve this. So did his parents, Colin and May Schooling, who have been totally dedicated to supporting his ambition. And congratulations to his coaches over the years, in Singapore and the US. Starting with Vincent Poon, who coached Joseph for 5 years when he was young.

Vincent is still going strong as a coach at age 70. He used to dive underwater to watch the young Joseph and help him improve his technique. So when Joseph's current coach Eddie Reese  -  the former coach of the US Men's Olympic Swimming Team - described Joseph as ""the closest human to a dolphin under water"", Vincent knew how it all began.

Now Joseph has made it to the finals,  topping the list, and history has been made for our little nation.

Joseph told the media after his semi-final win:  “I feel fine.. It was all about posting a good enough time to get into top eight. And come back tomorrow and try to do it. It’s a good confidence booster but doesn’t really mean anything.”  He’s quite the cool Joe.

“Part of me still wanted to be a football player. Now, I just want to walk again.” 

One of the most heartwarming stories I’ve come across this year: Muhammad Haikal Johari  (on the right of the photo). He’s 39, and works 6 days a week as Executive Chef at Spanish restaurant Alma, which earned a Michelin star last month. Just 10 months ago, Haikal was paralysed from the neck down after a motorbike accident. With daily physiotherapy at NUH, the support of his wife Rafiqah Soh, and sheer will, he’s got back some of the movement in his legs, and can move his hands. He’s also got back his voice. 

Haikal had been chosen by Juan Amador, a world-famous chef who is behind the restaurant. He had worked under Amador in Germany seven years ago. He now watches his team from his wheelchair with an eagle’s eye.  As he describes, “cooking can be done in the head as well. I see and taste everything and watch how things are presented on the plate.”
  
Haikal had begun working again on the restaurant menu while he was warded at NUH’s rehabilitation centre. He was at the restaurant when they heard the news of the Michelin star.  He told his team that it just meant that everyone had to work harder now. Together with chef de cuisine Muhammad Sufian Zaini (on the left), he’s determined to keep the coveted star and if possible add another.

Another interesting thing about Haikal’s life.  He was once a Singapore youth football  team player. But he kept getting ankle injuries, so he was persuaded by his late father to switch to something else. He developed a passion for cooking after going to Shatec, and then learnt the ropes from top chefs in a series of restaurants.
 
“It was a very hard transition for me when I went into cooking. Part of me still wanted to be a football player. Now, I just want to walk again.” And Haikal surely will.

496904023672427_1339806966048791,"Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri to all Muslims, and wishing everyone peace and our continuing spirit of togetherness in Singapore!

Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebrates forgiveness, and the renewal of relationships. Unfortunately this year it comes at a time of escalating religious extremism and attacks around the world. Just in the last week: the ISIS-related terror attacks in Muslim-majority countries  -  in Medina near the birthplace of Prophet Muhammad, in Baghdad, where the loss of lives was largest, in Istanbul and Dhaka, and closer home in KL and Solo. The attacks were targeted variously at both Sunni and Shia Muslims, and at foreigners and non-Muslims. In the same week, Buddhist mobs attacked mosques in Myanmar.
 
Religious extremism and acts of terror will be a threat everywhere, for years to come. We have to counter it actively -  counter intolerance of every form, within each of our faiths and in public life, as political and community leaders. And actively breed the openness of mind, and sense of balance, that is how every human civilisation has advanced, and must keep advancing.
 
It also means we have to keep enriching each young generation of Singaporeans with the experience of living in a multicultural society. We have to do more, and can. Go beyond accepting our differences, and beyond providing space for people of different faiths, to deepen interactions and friendships with each other starting from young. So that come what may, we stay resilient and resolutely together as Singaporeans.

There is also something in Swee Keat’s recovery that has to do with his own spirit, and the encouragement and prayers of so many people around the island. Just today, many people came up to me in Jurong to say how happy they were with the news. Welcome back, Swee Keat!"
496904023672427_1331060486923439,"Divided We Leave. 
That’s what the UK referendum result looks like.  London and Scotland voted to stay in the EU; Wales and the English provinces outside London voted to leave. The majority of the educated class voting to stay; the less educated to leave. Those doing well in their jobs and incomes voting to stay; those who felt they’ve been losing out voted to leave. Many more of the young voted to stay; old voting to leave.
   
It will take some time to draw the full lessons of the vote.  The big issues are not about financial markets or economics. The markets will react negatively, and overshoot, but this will not be like 2008 when the house came down.  There will be a loss of growth in the UK and Europe because of the uncertainty of the next few years, and the weaknesses there will also hurt the rest of the world including us in Asia.
  
But the more profound questions revolve around politics. Many of the people who voted for Britain to leave Europe, like those in England’s industrial cities, may end up being hurt by its economic consequences.  Yet their frustration over their jobs and wages, and their fear of uncontrolled immigration if Britain stayed in Europe, has shaped their votes.
 
There is a new brew in politics around the world, especially in the most mature democracies like the US, UK and in Europe. The growing appeal of nationalist politics, demagogues, and in some cases outright racism. (There was in fact all of that in the UK referendum debate.) A growing disaffection with the establishment. A weakening of trust and consensus in society, and of the centre in politics. That too has happened in the UK itself, with the two major parties now weakened.

As politics gets fragmented, the political extremes will gain appeal. We do not know where this will lead to, but it cannot mean anything good. But to tackle it, the politics of the centre must stay connected to the challenges that ordinary people face - and address their need for jobs and security, and a balance in immigration that preserves  a sense of identity.  Tackling this without turning inward, and weakening jobs and society further, is the central challenge everywhere.

He grew up in the US in the segregated South, and always knew what it was like to be looked down on.  He became a sensation when at age 18 he won the Olympics light-heavyweight gold. He called himself “the greatest ever” the moment he beat the feared Sonny Liston at age 22 for the world heavyweight title in 1964. And most still agree he was boxing’s greatest athlete.

""I would like to be remembered as a man who never looked down on those who looked up to him...who tried to unite all humankind through faith and love. And if all that's too much, then I guess I'd settle for being remembered only as a great boxer. And I wouldn't even mind if folks forgot how pretty I was.""

But the FA Cup final was also marred by some really bad fouls. The saddest when Marcus Rashford was brought down and had be replaced. Just 18, he’s the finest young star in English football. He’s already in the national squad for the Euro 16, but hope he recovers in time.

I took this photo of the Sara tree flower at an old Buddhist Monastery in Mendut in central Java a couple of years ago. Not far from Borobudur, one of the most remarkable monuments in the world. The tree is grown at many Buddhist temples around the region, where it is often called the Sala tree.  

The tree is also another instance of how our religions have been intertwined in history. Besides Buddhist temples, it is grown at Hindu temples that worship Shiva  -  because the flower is viewed as resembling a sacred multi-hooded snake perched on a lingam, the symbol of Shiva. In some parts of southern India, it is hence called the Nagalinga flower. Naga is the Sanskrit word for the snake, and viewed as representing the balancing forces of nature.  

The late Mr Kwek Leng Joo, who took some of the best photos of the natural world in Singapore, once showed me a beautiful photo of a Sara tree flower at the Botanic Gardens.

It takes us further in developing the two things we need most for our future: innovative enterprises and a stronger, more caring society. One really important aspect of our efforts: helping the kids who start off with less, to do well and move up. Few advanced societies have succeeded in this, which is why most of those born to parents with low incomes remain there throughout their own lives. 

We still have more mobility in Singapore than most places, but we have to work much harder at this in the years to come. The key is to intervene during the early years in life. Give the kids the confidence that they can achieve, give them the exposure they would not normally get, and help offset the disadvantages of having poor or unstable homes. We must do more, and we will.

The Budget strengthens our support for this group of parents and children. Everyone will get a First Step Grant to use for the child’s early development, besides the Baby Bonus. We are also starting a new programme of interventions called KidSTART, to try and make an impact in the first 6 years of life for kids from low-income backgrounds. And we will help families with children who have ended up in HDB rental flats, to own their own flat through the Fresh Start Housing Scheme. Owning your flat makes a difference to everyone in the family, including the stability and continuity it gives the kids.

It’s a wholesome mix, with cabbage, black fungus, lily flower buds, mushrooms, gingko nuts, dried beancurd strips and other ingredients. It’s also said to be a local dish, something to do with the Chinese in our part of the world. The name chap chye comes from Hokkien (literally ‘mixed vegetables’), though the Teochews, Hainanese and others have their own versions.  But some foodie experts say that the dish originated with the Peranakans. 

During Chinese New Year, people have often included black moss in the dish. It is considered auspicious because black moss in Mandarin (‘fa cai’) it sounds like the term for ""striking it rich"".  But black moss has become much less popular recently, because of health fears. China has also been concerned for some time about the harvesting of the moss, which grows in the deserts. Although it provides income for ordinary folk in the inner provinces, it removes the top layer that holds down the soil and leads to ever-larger sand storms.  

By the way, in the old days, chap chye was used mainly at funerals and for ancestral worship. So it was viewed by some as ‘pantang’ or taboo to serve it for meals at home. Fortunately, we now enjoy the dish without fear. And the Nonya chap chye still has its unique flavour. They use lots of taucheo (fermented bean curd).

Pongal in Tamil means ""boiling over"" or ""spilling over"", literally.  Its meaning is similar to the biblical ‘my cup runneth over’. Milk is traditionally boiled in a pot on this day, and when it boils over it symbolizes abundance and happiness. 

Pongal is not as well known among non-Indians as Deepavali and Thaipusam.  But it’s an important festival for the Tamils and others of South Indian origin. 

It is also the only major Indian festival that is based on the movement of the sun, rather than the moon. That’s also why the ‘kolam’ designs on the floor outside homes on Pongal day are often about the sun. 

It all goes back to ancient times – when Pongal was a harvest festival. But it is celebrated actively today, wherever the Tamils have gone, including in Europe and North America. It has become a celebration of cultural heritage and community.

What children prefer, however, is another meaning of Pongal - the name of a sweet dish of rice boiled with lentils, which is eaten on the day. Quite nice, if you get a chance to have it."

And everywhere else: by refusing to be intimidated, by deepening bonds amongst people of different faiths and cultures, and by developing a spirit of open-mindedness in all our societies. 

Everyone is responsible for building this: those who lead religious reformation, political and community leaders who ensure we stay united, and all of us as neighbours, schoolmates and colleagues who must build friendships from young and through life. Nothing can ever defeat the spirit of open-mindedness.

People often ask why those who celebrate Deepavali have oil lamps lit up at their homes, often through the night. There are many old legends behind this. But the essence is the same and it is really universal. It’s about the flame of the human spirit: overcoming the darkness of ignorance and bigotry with learning and understanding. 
It’s as relevant today as it has ever been. Religious extremism is on the rise, in every major religion including Hinduism itself. Ethnic intolerance too, almost all over the world.
 
Unfortunately it will probably take decades before people are won over by moderate political forces, and religious extremism is overcome by internal reformation. It is a real challenge in the meantime, everywhere. 
All the more that we do everything we can to keep Singapore a place where tolerance and open minds prevail. Where everyone grows up with friends of different races and religions, and where there is some give and take in everyday life in our neighbourhoods, so we live together without any unease. And where we develop a deeper and genuine interest and understanding of each other.
   
The photo shows a Javanese version of Ganesh, the elephant-headed Hindu deity. Ganesh is significant because he is worshipped by all the Hindu sects (each with its own main deity), but also because he has travelled beyond India and Hinduism. In northern China, statues of Ganesh date back to the first century. In Japan, Ganesh is worshipped as Sho-ten (or Kangi-ten). There are major temples in Osaka and Nara dedicated to him – where he is worshipped as a remover of obstacles to success in business or courtship. A 12th century temple of Ganesh in Tokyo has been declared a national treasure.
 
Ganesh is also found all over Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, where Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam overlapped and enriched culture, Ganesh is still worshipped by the Chinese, Hindus and the Kejawen (those who practice the Javanese syncretic tradition). There is a spectacular selection of Ganesh statues in the national museum in Jakarta. They are in the  Hindu temples that remain in Java and especially Bali. But also elsewhere  -  a famous Ganesh statue is in the Sanggar Agung Temple (or Hong San Tang) in Surabaya, where the main deity is in fact the Buddhist goddess of mercy, Kuan Yin.
 
And everywhere Ganesh has gone, there are variations in how he is depicted. The common feature, besides his elephant head, is a broken tusk which he usually holds in his right hand as a writing instrument. Otherwise, he is depicted with anything from 2 to 16 arms, with a different symbolism in each version. The Javanese applied their own artistry to Ganesh. The sculpture in the photo is actually very unusual, as he only has one arm.  

A long story about Ganesh. But everywhere we look, we find examples of learning across religious and cultural boundaries. Much  borrowing and adaptation, as all our human traditions evolved, whether Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist. We cannot pretend otherwise. The flame of the human spirit is universal."

It has something to do with 1965, something about school loyalty, and something about the surprises that keep coming up. These are the girls from Jurong Secondary (JSS) who just became national basketball champs last week, beating Nanyang Girls High in the ‘C” Div finals. Nanyang Girls and Anglican High have dominated in recent years. No one expected JSS to win. But they had real spirit, a dedicated coach and knew that it mattered so much to the school.  And there’s one more thing that makes them stand out in basketball that has been a largely Chinese game in Singapore  -  they are a multiracial bunch of girls, including 3 Malays, 1 Indian and a Japanese.  They are great friends now. 

Here is the 1965 story. The boys basketball coach is Tay Choon Joo. He is 82 years old! I couldn’t believe it when I met him – upright and well-toned. He joined JSS as a PE teacher just when Singapore became independent. Spent his entire career there, then stayed on after retirement.  The girls coach is Vincent Koh Chin Heng, who was himself a student at the school in the early 80s. He came back to coach, starting in the late 80s. There’s something special in school loyalty. 

It’s just like no one expected the kids from Jurong Primary to beat top secondary schools like NUS High, Hwa Chong and Dunman High earlier this year in the national Flying Machine competition. I wrote about them in April. We have to keep looking out for talent and spirit everywhere. And we will find it."

None of us who grew up in the 60s and 70s knew what Singapore would become a few decades later. But we could feel the growing Singapore spirit. It is in all of us today, and makes us who we are.

496904023672427_1124367107592779,"A mural depicting the early days of Taman Jurong, by a group of kids from Lakeside Primary School. They imagined some of the things that older residents of the estate remember, like the SAF personnel from the old Taman Jurong Camp who were often at the bus-stops. The simple playgrounds which the children enjoyed. And the early HDB blocks which had no void decks.  

When the mural was unveiled recently, quite a few men who were watching recalled their own days doing NS in Taman Jurong Camp. And many recall the old Yung Sheng Rd hawker centre –  popularly called “60 stalls” (六十档).  It was the first hawker centre in Singapore that brought together resettled street hawkers. “60 stalls” was a simple construction, but lasted for over 30 years. It was upgraded a decade ago -  the new Taman Jurong Market and Food Centre sits on the very same site. Some of the old, famous stalls still draw patrons  from around the island.

The mural by Lakeside Primary is on the ground floor of the new hawker centre. On the first and second floors, there are other nice murals. One by Xingnan Primary School depicts what they thought Jurong might have looked like before it was developed in the 1960s -  the swampy land, the villages and small hills. Another mural, by students at Jurong Secondary School, paints Bruce Lee in action at the old drive-in cinema at Taman Jurong.

He had style. He wasn’t very tall at 1.68m, but was known for his flying headers. The legendary coach Choo Seng Quee described him this way: ""Running through like a reindeer, he meets a cross from the right flank in front of goal. He times and judges the ball as he runs, in his first stride he leaps into the air to meet the ball, then he nods or flicks it past the helpless goalkeeper.”

Kim Swee was one of several stars then. He once said that his scoring job was made easy because he had people like Majid Ariff, Arthur Koh, Rahim Omar, Ali Astar and Ibrahim Mansoor alongside him. The next time we won the Malaysia Cup was in 1977. 

Kim Swee was of course from the outstanding Quah family in football  -  he was the third of the six brothers who played for Singapore; three of their sisters played for the women’s team. Another brother also represented Singapore in track and field.

The photos show two ancient Korans, one from China and the other Java, part of a remarkable heritage collection that is preserved at Ba’alwie Mosque in Bukit Timah. Both hand-written, on hand-made paper from the mulberry tree. The story of how Islam came to be in Southeast Asia is part of the richness of the region’s civilisations. How Islam arrived, how it was absorbed in a region that had for centuries been layered by Hindu-Buddhist culture, and how the  cultures of the region influenced each other and developed a distinctive local character in each society over time. 

Many of us can remember Parameswara (later called Iskandar Shah) from our school textbooks. He ruled the Malacca Sultanate in the early 15th century, when it became the most significant Islamic kingdom in the region. Parameswara is said by some historians to have embraced Islam at the time of Admiral Zheng He’s visits to Malacca. Zheng He (Cheng Ho) was a pious man, and the most famous Chinese Muslim to visit Southeast Asia. But less well known is the role of Muslim Chinese traders who came from places like Guangdong and Changchou  long before Zheng He, and their role in spreading Islam, for eg in Java. Like the merchants from various parts of India, who brought Islam, and especially the Sufi tradition that  prevailed in the region for a long time. And those from the Arab world -  most prominently the Hadhrami entrepreneurs from Yemen, who also brought Sufism in the 19th century. They brought other influences too - dance and music, which combined with Malay aesthetics to become what we call the Zapin tradition today. Names like Aljunied, Alkaff and Alsagoff  in Singapore reflect our Yemeni heritage.             

It’s worth remembering how these different strands of Islamic culture came together in the region, and co-existed with other cultures over long periods. I wrote in my post on Hari Raya Aidilfitri last year about the example of the Kraton in Jogjakarta, where the combination of Islamic, Hindu and Buddhist cultures is preserved and celebrated. 

Knowing history gives us confidence in interfaith civilization, despite the efforts of the extremists and ideologues of many faiths. It’s also why we can take pride in being Singaporeans, and why every child must grow up knowing that they are enriched by our multi-cultural heritage - and care to keep it alive and deepen it."

The photo – one of the more unusual gems at the Botanics, the Curtain Ivy. Its long reddish aerial roots form a lacy curtain. (I took the photo late one night recently.) It is actually a close relative of the grape plant, and its fruits look like small black grapes.  

By the way, the Botanics was part of the fascinating story of how rubber came to transform Malaya and Singapore during the colonial era. Rubber trees grew only in Brazil until the late 1800s. But the trees in Brazil were blighted by a germ, and they could not stop it from spreading. (I learnt this during a visit to Brazil three weeks ago.) The British, smart fellows, smuggled seeds to London, and then sent 22 seedlings to the Botanics in Singapore for cultivation. It turned out they could survive. Rubber trees were then taken to Java and Malaya, which became the leading producer of rubber in the world. 

It was Henry Nicholas Ridley  -  the first director of the Botanics in 1888, whose research led to the discovery of a method of tapping rubber without damaging the trees -  which enabled the plantations to flourish. Ridley Park is Singapore named after him."

STATEMENT FROM THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE
The Prime Minister is deeply saddened by the deaths of eight Singaporeans in the earthquake at Mount Kinabalu. They were one teacher and six pupils from Tanjong Katong Primary School on an overseas learning trip, plus one adventure guide. One teacher and one student are still missing. 
On behalf of all Singaporeans, the Prime Minister expresses his deepest condolences and sympathies to their families and loved ones. As we grieve over the loss of these young lives, we also take heart that they were striving to stretch their limits and take on new challenges. 
The Prime Minister also thanks all those who are working tirelessly in the search, rescue and recovery efforts – the Malaysian authorities, the search and rescue teams, the hospital staff, and all the officers and volunteers who are helping in one way or other in Sabah and Singapore.
Monday, 8 June 2015 will be a Day of National Remembrance. State flags on all Government buildings will be flown at half-mast. One minute of silence will be observed at the beginning of the day at all SEA Games venues.
We hope that this collective expression of sympathy and support from all Singaporeans will give solace and comfort to the families and loved ones of the victims."

Beautifully ageing bark. Perfect photo taken last week by Chan Boon Hong, one of the many bird-watchers (they call themselves birders) who frequent the Japanese and Chinese Gardens over the weekends. 

It’s a remarkable diversity. About a third of the birds are migratory, escaping the cold in the temperate zones. Some quite rare like the Peregrine Falcon (which is also the fastest creature in the animal world at 389 km/h) or the Large Hawk-Cuckoo (looks like an elegant pigeon to me). The other birds are residents of the tropics, like the spectacular Spotted Wood Owl, several Kingfisher species and the Savanna Nightjar. Dr Wu Eu Heng, who lives near the lake, told me of Savanna Nightjars that were  just found roosting in Japanese Garden. 

We will be developing new features at the Lake, for the young and the young at heart  - boardwalks in the lake, community gardens, and the Science Centre on the northeastern shore. But we want to retain the naturalness of the Gardens, and protect the natural habitat of the birds – and the birders.

They made their glider from balsa wood, and launched it with a catapult. How did they get to soar, beating 92 other teams? A good mentor, not being afraid to try, and just persevering.
 
After I read about them in The Straits Times, I asked Jurong Primary’s Principal, Mrs S Manokara, how the pupils did it. There was nothing extraordinary, but a good teacher and kids who enjoy what they are doing and take their training seriously. Their Science teacher, Mr Low Heng Chong, taught them simple aerodynamics and encouraged them to read up on their own. They had been practising since January, after school hours, and had built up some experience from previous competitions. And they had good team skills.
 
Jurong Primary entered three teams. Their winning team, called JPS Falcon, took part in the secondary school competition, which required them to design an unpowered glider and fly it into scoring zones, instead of the primary category - which involved folding paper planes to fly them the furthest.

We get these surprises all the time, from schools around the island. Kids who soar, regardless of their backgrounds. And we must keep getting them to surprise and to soar."

Singapore is what it is because of Mr Lee. We survived as a small nation and earned our place in the world because of him. 
Singapore will also live on because of him. Lee Kuan Yew made Singapore to last. He led a team, not a one-man show. He groomed new leaders. He built clean  government, and a culture of telling it straight -  telling people the problems, and finding a way to fix them.   

Most fundamentally, he built a multiracial nation that has endured  - still being deepened, and a rarity internationally. 

And Mr Lee kept us all looking to the future - never satisfied with today, always searching for the next challenge, always wanting a future better for Singaporeans. 

The best way to honour Mr Lee is for each new generation of Singaporeans to build on what they inherit, live by their ideals, and strive to make our society fair, just and great.

“Each generation brings with it a fresh burst of enthusiasm, energy, vitality. Each generation is fired by its vision of the ideal society in an ideal world. The ideal can never be achieved but because men have ideals, those societies progress.” Lee Kuan Yew, 1988

It was labour-intensive, but also the first factory offering significant employment for women. The factory no longer exists, and the place is very different today.

Our Jubilee Budget today was focused on Singapore’s future. Two of the main directions:

Helping Singaporeans to develop themselves at every stage of life. No one's potential should be limited by the grades they obtained when they were young.

Giving people greater assurance as they grow older - through the new Silver Support scheme as well as enhancements to the CPF to help lower and middle-income Singaporeans.  

But we must also change our culture -  as individuals, as employers and as a whole society - so that learning at any time in life becomes the habit. 

This excerpt of the Budget Speech below talks about this. The full speech and various initiatives are at  http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2015/home.aspx
  
“…we need a different motivation in our society. Our economic and social culture must change:
 
a.	As individuals, we have to view the education that we get when we are young as but the starting point of a journey of personal learning, and self-renewal throughout our lives. Whichever the job, we must want to master what we do, and gain satisfaction from it. We must also develop a culture of mentoring, where individuals who have developed expertise and experience share their knowledge and passion with others, at their own workplaces, at education centres, and in the community.

b.	Employers must recognise what the best companies have found: that people are their biggest opportunity. Every employer must look for the potential in their people, and put time and effort into developing this potential with them. It also means looking out for mid-career Singaporeans who are temporarily dislocated, and helping them to get back in, get re-trained where necessary, and contribute their worth. And it matters greatly too when employees are empowered. The most innovative companies find that ideas come from people from all across the enterprise – whether for an improved workflow, a new colour or design, or a better way to reach customers’ hearts.
 
c.	In industry too, we need a new, collaborative culture, to take Singapore’s skills to a much higher level. We do not have the long tradition of collaboration in countries like Germany and Switzerland, where companies join forces to develop skills for the whole industry. We have to develop our own tradition, and find practical means to deepen collaboration, industry by industry. It will be especially critical to developing capabilities among our SMEs, who on their own often lack the capacity to attract and train people.

….Our aspirations are attainable. We can build a future that keeps social mobility alive in each new generation. A future that meets the aspirations of young and middle-aged Singaporeans, and enables us to realise the best in ourselves. And a future with greater assurance as we grow old. We must go forward with the blend of imagination and practicality that brought Singapore this far in 50 years. With hard heads, but warm hearts too, so that we all move up together.”"

The Teochews believe it is auspicious, bringing good health and well being. I am told they have an old Teochew saying: “Buay Chang Buay Tee, Lai Jiak Chiorh Her Pi” (there is no good spelling for this in English), meaning ‘sell farm, sell land, let’s eat pomfret nose’. 

Below: I found this touching account of Chinese New Year in the old days, by Allan Tan, on the Singapore Memory website. Life was very different. We found happiness in different ways. But the simple goodness of family was so important, and remains what’s most meaningful in our lives today. 

“In the 60s, Chinese New Year was a great time of fun and celebration for kids, who would look forward to it in great anticipation one month before it happened, as it was the only time of the year that most of the poor families could have chicken meat for food, soft drinks, lots of sweets, etc. The normal meals for my family were porridge, olives, fried ikan bilis, and a teochew dish known as 'hu-ju'. These were the cheapest food one could buy, and cost 10 cents for each portion - we could only afford 30 cents and porridge for dinner each day. On days when my mother had more money, we could have rice. So CNY was eagerly awaited.

Besides food and drinks, the other of course was ang-pows. It was the only time when a kid could have more money, or the most money, he could ever had in his life. I had only 5 cents to go to school, and had to take a 20 mins walk to school in order to spend that 5 cents on a drink or a piece of cake. During CNY, with ang-pows from neighbours and relatives, we could get up to $2. The feeling of having so much money to spend on what we normally could not afford was pure bliss!

Besides money, new clothes also made us kids  ecstatic, as we usually had hand-me-downs from elder members in the family or kind neighbours or relatives. For my family, my mother had to save all useable cloths and then sew them into a shirt or blouse whenever she could. 

Another thing that drove our adrenalin was fire crackers! They would be on sale about 3 weeks before the occasion, and we kids would watching some adults playing with them. Some shops would buy a long train of huge firecrackers, hang it from the top of the houses (about 4 to 5 stories of our HDB flat today), and then the noise of the firecrackers exploding would attract the whole neighbourhood, followed by liion dances.

By the first day of CNY, all the streets would be red in color, being fully filled with the red wrappers of the firecrackers. What a wonderful sight! What wonderful memories!”"

-------------------------------------------------------------
Hope PM has a smooth operation, gets good rest, and will be up and about and his usual self very soon. 

None of us can avoid the ups and downs of life. But I’ve always marveled at how PM bounced back from his bout with lymphoma more than two decades ago, and his sheer energy:  leading and guiding in government, taking a personal interest in people from all walks of life, and earning great respect for Singapore at international meetings. And always learning. Knowing him, he will be taking immense interest in the robot during his prostatectomy today! 
   
I got this photo taken from PM’s facebook page, where he had penned this message: “Joshua is a selfless boy, who has been very good helping his classmate who has Autism Spectrum Disorder. Joshua took on more family responsibilities when his father had a stroke. But he continued to work hard at his studies and do well. His mother (on my left) was there to see him receive the Edusave Character Award.” (MCI Photo by Terence) — with Joshua Noel Dinesh Ramanathan."

Shirley Nair and The Silver Strings were one of the local bands that sprang up in the 60s. They were different from most others, because they wrote their own songs – like the hit single in 1965, ‘You’re The Boy’, and ‘I Won’t Let You See Me Cry’. 

I’ve been following music for decades, but there’s always something special about the 60s. It has that simple, stirring quality.  The local bands were often multiracial. And they had the spirit of the times -  people just took their chances. As Audie Ng, founding member of The Silver Strings, put it recently  – “We never thought of success and fame. We liked it and we worked very hard, took every chance to get some exposure and hoped people accepted us for what we were”.  

The Silver Strings was formed by four students of music teacher Harry Martinez  -  Audie Ng on bass, David Chan lead guitar, Merlin Lim rhythm guitar and Danny Boy on drums. Others came in later. Shirley Nair joined them when she was 19. She had an unusual voice, that brought stardom. 

When the Rolling Stones performed at the Singapore Badminton Hall in 1965, they were an opening act. The Silver Strings also wrote the theme song for the famous 1964 Malay comedy film, Mat Tiga Suku (starring Mat Sentol), and had cameo roles in the film. 

Shirley Nair has left us, succumbing to cancer two decades ago. But The Silver Strings have had a few reunion performances in recent years, now in their late 60s and early 70s.

They were like the other pioneering bands of the 60s. Some of you will remember the names. Naomi and The Boys, fronted by Naomi Suriya, with hits like ‘Happy, Happy Birthday – the 1965 song of the year in Singapore and Malaysia. The Crescendos - originally with Susan Lim, who unfortunately died tragically off the coast of Trengganu. The Thunderbirds, with hits like ‘My Lonely Heart’. The Quests, with Vernon Cornelius as lead singer. The Stylers, who like The Quests performed in English, Chinese and Malay. Matthew Tan and the Mandarins, who made it big with Country Western songs. The Cyclones, with brothers Siva and James Choy, who sang together with the Checkmates. The Blue Diamonds, with Ruud and Riem de Wolff, who came from Indonesia. 

The video 'You're the Boy' is among those produced by SG50 in commemoration of our 50 years of nationhood."

The photo? I took it last week at the Jvari Church, built in the 6th century, perched above the  town of Mtskheta  in Georgia.  It is part of the beautiful and diverse Caucasus region: one of the ancient cradles of civilization, and at the crossroads of East and West, Islam and Christianity. My family and I just returned this evening from visiting a few places in the region for a break.
  
The region has seen tragic conflicts in recent times, and large loss of lives. But the conflicts have less to do with ancient rivalries than with modern political calculation. And the conflicts have little to do with religion.  The Caucuses have actually been a region where Christians, Muslims and others lived together and mainly accommodated each other over the centuries.  

Incidentally, this is also where wine may have originated from. Till today, Georgia and Azerbaijan are known to produce excellent wines.
  
For those with an appetite for more about this fascinating region, here goes.
  
Georgia and neighbouring Armenia were the earliest nations to adopt Christianity -  early in the 4th century, and before the Roman Empire did. Together with Azerbaijan, they are the three small nations that comprise the Caucasus, the region named after the magnificent arc of mountains that divides Russia from the Middle East.  Azerbaijan was originally a centre of the Zoroastrian faith (one of the most important religions two millennia ago), before becoming Muslim. 

By the way, there is a reason for the term Caucasians, which has often been used to refer to all white people of European descent.  Many Europeans trace their ancient roots to the peoples of the Causasus, including Azerbaijan.
 
The small nations of  the Caucasus have had many layers of history and culture, reflecting the influences of the large powers that controlled them  -  the Greeks, Romans, Persians and Arabs in early times; conquest by the Mongols in the 13th century; followed by centuries of contest between the Turkish Ottomans and the Persian dynasties; then control by the Russians from the early 19thcentury till the break-up of the Soviet Union two decades ago.
   
But from early times, there was co-existence of people of the different ethnic groups and faiths in the Caucasus. They lived in the same towns, spoke each other’s very different languages, and shared similar rituals. They all adopted elements of Persian culture. Even during the centuries of rule of the Caucasus by Muslim empires from Ottoman Turkey and Persia, Christian peoples were allowed to keep their faiths. (The major ethnic tragedy came in the 20th century, in Turkey’s Eastern Anatolia region, where the Armenians were forcibly expelled in 1915.) 

The capital cities of the Caucasus were also examples of the remarkable mix and flow of people of different ethnic groups across the region. Yerevan, capital of Christian Armenia, had a Muslim majority for much of its past; Tbilisi, today’s capital of Georgia, was historically controlled not by Georgians but by Armenian merchants; Baku, capital of Azerbaijan was the most cosmopolitan and indeed a centre of jazz music.
 
Today’s relations in the Caucasus too defy religious lines. Armenia has closer relations with Iran than with its old Christian neighbor, Georgia. Azerbaijan, which runs a secular state but whose people are Shiite Muslim, cooperates more closely with Turkey (Sunni Muslim) and Georgia than with Shiite Iran.
    
There have been bloody conflicts in the region over the last two decades, following the break-up of the Soviet Union. But they are not about religion either. The people of South Ossetia and Abhkazia, who have broken away from Georgia (but are not internationally recognized as independent nations) are Orthodox Christian like the Georgians.  Indeed the region that was also feared to break away from Georgia but did not, Ajaria, is Muslim. The Ajarians decided to remain Georgian nationals.
  
The biggest conflict, between Armenia and Azerbaijan, is a long-standing territorial fight - over  the  region of Nagorno-Karabakh.  Its people are mainly Armenian, but it is recognized internationally as belonging to Azerbaijan. It has rich soils, and has been in dispute since the 1920s when the Bolsheviks  made Nagorno-Karabakh  part of Soviet Azerbaijan.
 
The conflicts and breakaways remain unresolved.  But there was nothing predetermined about them. They reflect political maneuvers within each country following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and repeated failures of negotiation.  And these local poltical conflicts have also been shaped by geopolitical realities: Russia's strategic interests in the disputed areas near its borders, and by comparison the West’s incapacity to intervene despite its promises.
  
There can be no simple summary of the problems of the region, and they are likely to remain unresolved for some time.  But we should not lose sight of the bigger history of the Caucasus:  the centuries of accommodation and friendship between ordinary people of different faiths and cultures. It’s what we need more of, all over the world."

A happy Deepavali to all Hindus, and everyone who appreciates and treasures Singapore's diversity! I'm  having to celebrate this year's Deepavali in my mind - in Beijing's Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, amidst a meeting of APEC Finance Ministers.

There are several Indian legends behind why Deepavali (or Diwali) is called the “Festival of Lights”. But the essential spirit behind it is universal. It is about the human spirit: the triumph of the light of learning and understanding over the darkness of ignorance and bigotry.
 
The winds are unfortunately blowing the other way. We are seeing a rise in religious and ethnic tensions and conflicts, almost everywhere in the world today.
 
The headlines are about the Middle-East – the growth of Islamist aggression against the Kurds, Christians and Yazidis, in defiance of the long history of Muslim civilisation that was in fact relatively free of the persecutions of people of other faiths and holocausts that marked other civilisations; the surge in Sunni-Shia rivalry within the Muslim world; and the denial of Palestinian rights to co-existence. 

But the problems are elsewhere too.  In the continuing rise of the religious right in Christianity and Hinduism. And in the discrimination against minorities and rise of ethnic nationalism, in parts of Europe and Asia.
  
We cannot just hope for a better world.  The problems are in fact likely to get worse, and over many years, before they get better. Fighting this requires leadership, internationally and in each of our societies, collective will, and everyday actions by all of us. 

We must keep Singapore a place where tolerance is part of everyday life. And more than tolerance: we must be a society founded on open-mindedness, empathy and understanding of each other. Where there is some give and take, so we live easily with each other. Where every kid grows up with friends of other races and religions.  There is more to be done. So that we remain a peaceful place, a place where the flame of human spirit stays alive against the winds of intolerance."
496904023672427_937030669659758,"Learning through life. It's never too late. 

One of the interesting things about the community colleges in the US is the way people of all ages enroll - and often in the same class. Some are fresh school leavers. Quite a few are university grads who want to pick up a practical skill to help them in their careers. And some are at the end of their careers, just wanting to pick up a hobby. 

Like these two senior folk whom I met last week, while on a study trip to community colleges in the Bay Area on the US west coast.  Both were learning for the sake of a hobby. 

One of them was a lawyer, 67, who was taking a course in metalworking at De Anza College in Cupertino. (He's on the left.) He told me he wanted to make things with his hands.  The other had retired, and enjoyed cooking. He was taking a culinary arts course at Laney College in Oakland. He wanted to ""make me a better cook"". One of his team-mates in their training kitchen was a structural engineer in her 30s, who wanted to switch to the restaurant trade. They enjoyed the peer-learning with people of different backgrounds.

We are launching the SkillsFuture movement. It will make it easy for everyone to learn whenever they wish  - back in a poly, ITE or university, or through our  new lifelong learning institutes or other training providers. The courses can be short and bite-sized - a few weeks or months. Or modules that can be stacked up to form a longer course. And either taken online or in actual classes and labs.

It's never too early or late to learn. That's the culture we must create for ourselves in Singapore."

496904023672427_897725846923574,"Happy National Day to all Singaporeans and Majulah Singapura!

The words of our national anthem carry a simple and profound spirit. It is about togetherness, and aspiring for a better future. That was the spirit of our pioneers, and must still be what Singapore is about. “What Singapore becomes depends on what we make of it…Let us dedicate ourselves to working together, and building a brighter future for us all” – PM Lee in his National Day Message yesterday.

Schoolchildren sing our national anthem daily. But many Singaporeans admit that they do not understand the words they are singing, which are in Malay, our national language. Some learnt the meaning in school and later forgot. Some do not know what they are singing even in school. We must make an effort to understand the national anthem. It is simple, it is ours, and it is part of our identity. 
 
Zubir Said, seen in the photo in his later years, composed our national anthem. He was one of our pioneers. He was a self-taught musician, who first came to Singapore in 1928 from Bukittinggi in the Minangkabau highlands of Sumatra. He joined a bangsawan or Malay opera troupe. After the war, he joined Shaw Brothers as an orchestra conductor, then later as song-writer. He passed away at age 80 in 1987 at his home at Joo Chiat Place. 

Pak Zubir first wrote Majulah Singapura in 1958. It was commissioned by the City Council for the re-opening of Victoria Theatre that year. When we attained self-government in 1959, the song was revised and adopted as a national anthem by our first elected Legislative Assembly. It replaced “God Save the Queen” in Nov 1959.  

The main change from the 1958 version was to shorten the anthem (by 4 lines) so it could be sung easily by school-children. Some of the original scripts with handwritten amendments are on display at our Malay Heritage Centre. There were further small changes before Majulah Singapura became our national anthem in 1965. The aim was to have an anthem with simple words in the national language that everyone, people of different races, could easily understand and sing. 

Let’s make sure we all know what our national anthem means, help every child understand it, and sing it with our hearts year after year!

Majulah Singapura and English translation below.

496904023672427_889937861035706,"Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri to all Muslims, and wishing everyone peace and our continuing spirit of togetherness in Singapore!  

Take a good look at this puzzling photo. It is of an unusual, underground mosque (Masjid Bawah Tanah) in Yogyakarta, in central Java. The mosque, built in 1750, has a quizzically simple, artistic design. It is a circular building, with five stairways leading upward - as you can see. They are said to symbolise the five Islamic principles. Four of the stairways rise above a round pond at the base of the building. They meet at the center to form a small stage. The fifth staircase, leading up from the stage, is said to represent the pilgrimage to Mecca for Muslims. The Imam would stand on the small stage to deliver his sermon, taking advantage of the acoustics of the circular building.

This is part of a complex of buildings and compounds linked to the Kraton, or the palace of the Yogyakarta Sultans since the 18th century. The current monarch, Sultan Hamengkubuwono X, is also the Governor of the Yogyakarta region and widely respected in Indonesia.  I visited the Kraton recently during a short break with my family. It is always a serene experience, and a reminder of how a culture of tolerance evolved over centuries in Java. Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic influences (in historical order) are carefully combined and preserved in the design of the Kraton - from the entrances, to the carvings on the pillars of its meeting halls, and even the trees in its compounds. They are also reflected in the cultural performances that are held on most days in the Kraton, like the gamelan music, the Wayang Kulit performances based on the Hindu Ramayana, the dances and the Wayang Golek or puppet shows.  They speak of their cultural heritage with pride in Jogja.   

Hari Raya Aidilfitri is a celebration of forgiveness, reconciliation and renewal of relationships. This year, sadly, it takes place while conflicts are increasing around the world, with tragic loss of human lives.  The shooting down of MH17 over a divided Ukraine, killing all on board. The escalating Sunni-Shia conflict in the Middle East, and now the new threat of ethnic cleansing by ISIS.   

And the tragedy in Gaza, where in the last three weeks a thousand Palestinians, mainly innocent civilians, have lost their lives in a cycle of retribution between Hamas and Israel.  Our thoughts and prayers must be with the victims and all those suffering in Gaza, in the spirit of humanity and regardless of our own faiths. The violence is no solution. It only deepens enmities, and risks even greater dangers in future."
496904023672427_876365385726287,"That’s James Rodriguez of Colombia, preparing to take a penalty against Brazil in yesterday’s quarterfinals  -  unaware of the huge grasshopper sitting on his sleeve. It turned out to be a good omen and he scored. (By the way I’m told grasshoppers are a symbol of good things in many cultures, including Chinese.)

Colombia still went down to Brazil, and I was sad to see them go. It was the first time they made it to a World Cup quarter-finals. They played their hearts out, and wept when the final whistle went. James Rodriguez, 22, has great promise. Some have called him the new Maradona.

The World Cup is still wide open. Brazil has been set back by Neymar’s injury yesterday which takes him out of the tournament. The Germans have had an uneven tournament, although they impressed when they dominated France yesterday - good all round, strong finishing and annoyingly efficient German passing.

The short and long of the World Cup?  Brazilian striker Jo became the player with the shortest name to ever make a World Cup finals appearance. And Sokratis Papastathopoulos broke the record for having the longest surname of a World Cup goalscorer. (I counted -  that’s two letters longer than mine.) He scored the dramatic late equaliser for Greece against Costa Rica, before the Greeks eventually lost on penalty kicks."

Including stunning ones, like Robin van Persie’s diving header when Netherlands beat Spain. Just look at the photo, and the sheer athleticism.
  
And we’ve had upsets. Spain (the reigning champs), Italy and England are out. Underdogs like Costa Rica who beat Italy and topped their group, Chile and Colombia have made it through with fast counter-attacking play and guts.

We saw the fastest sprint ever recorded by a footballer according to FIFA, when Dutchman Arjen Robben stormed through the Spanish half at 37km per hour before scoring Netherland’s fifth goal.  What made it more impressive -  he did it near the end of a fast-running match, and at 30 he is no youngster on the field.
 
There is still no obvious favourite to win.  Brazil and Argentina, who were among the pre-tournament favourites, have depended heavily on the individual brilliance of Neymar and Messi (both top-scorers so far with 4 goals each) but  otherwise have not impressed greatly. We have also seen more closely-fought games this time, more games that were decided in the last five minutes, and more games where both sides score goals.
 
So don’t rule out surprises in the knock-out round."

And everyone else, every race, every age, who wanted to kick heels, push themselves or just be part of the 15,000 people who ran the scenic route by Jurong Lake, Japanese Garden and Chinese Garden. Every km that was run raised a dollar, for five voluntary organisations who do good work with disadvantaged youth and the elderly. Money was not the object, but we did raise $150k for them.  What’s also special about Jurong Lake Run is the fact that it is organised entirely by volunteers. They give it strong legs. 

Talking about strong legs, more on the World Cup later. In my opinion it has been one of the most thrilling first rounds in a long time."
496904023672427_798092020220291,"One of Chua Sian Chin’s legacies was a greatly improved nursing profession. As Minister of Health (1968-1974), he put much effort into promoting nursing. Better careers, and working conditions -  such as changing the strenuous 7 night-shifts system. Many more nurses were recruited and trained -  with more also going beyond basic nursing to develop various specialist skills. 

Those early years laid the foundations for the strong and caring nursing profession that forms the backbone of our healthcare system. 

I had a look at several of Chua Sian Chin’s talks to nurses in the early 70s. They were mainly about the measures being taken to develop the profession. He sometimes reflected on the public feedback on nurses, and encouraged them to take all feedback in the right spirit. This quote comes from his speech at the Nurses Graduation Ceremony in May 1972 at the Singapore Conference Hall:

“I would advise you to do your job honestly and conscientiously and have no fears if you cannot please everyone. Of course, members of the public are generally as a whole reasonable and just people and they do appreciate good service, although most of them are not very expressive in their acknowledgement. I am, however, proud to say that our standards here are about the best in this region and compare very favourably with those in the developed countries.....You should always perform your duties with a sense of service, vocation and a willingness to help your fellowmen.”"

And we are working to uplift the poor and give their children the best chances  to do well in life, from preschool to tertiary education, so that our society preserves a sense of equity and opportunity for all.

She and others in the ‘golden generation’ in Singapore athletics which won numerous medals at the SEAP Games and Asian Games in the 60s and 70s - and set national records that stood for decades. Glory and other athletes of that era were at the Pioneer Generation event at the Istana this morning.

They trained on bitumen tracks, with little except old-fashioned determination. Among the men, people like C Kunalan in sprints (and widely regarded as our best athlete to date), Osman Merican in the hurdles (his 110m hurdles record still stands today), PC Suppiah in the long distances (his 10,000 metres national record set in 1972 also still standing), and Nor Azhar Hamid (high jump). Among the women, Chee Swee Lee (400m), Heather Siddons-Merican (in hurdles like her husband Osman),  and K Jayamani (middle-distances).
  
Some of you will remember Glory’s stunning victory in the 200m at the 1973 SEAP Games in Singapore. She was 31, older than the rest, and had just returned from a two-year study break. Till today, the 1974  national women’s 4x400m relay record that she and Maimoon Azlan, Lee Tai Jong and Chee Swee Lee set  at the Asian Games  in Tehran remains unbroken.
 
Glory is still so active.  In her early 70s, she is now a physical education teacher at Springfield Secondary School. And in athletics. At last year’s International Gold Masters in Kyoto, Japan, she won a gold in high jump – yes, high jump, not sprints - and using the old ‘scissor’ technique, which was popular before the ‘straddle’ technique and the ‘Fosbury Flop’ became the norm amongst high-jumpers. Plus she won a silver in long jump.

We each had a favourite teacher. Someone who motivated us, gave us confidence in ourselves, or was extra kind. As we approach Singapore’s 50th year, they deserve honour.  

The group in the photo were among the educationists at the Pioneer Generation party that PM hosted at the Istana.

She worked with her teachers and alumni to make it a much sought after English-stream school.  Mdm Fong was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 1997, but returned after 6 months to immerse herself once again in school life. When I met her before she retired in 2003 to thank her for her outstanding contributions to education, her reply was simple - ""It was my duty"".

I’ve met her a few times in Taman Jurong, where she lives. She is 101 this year -  that’s her in the picture. Still healthy and alert, and talking with friends. One of her friends came up to hug her at the event.  
Mdm Koh came from a family with 12 children, which was common in the old days. She got married before the age of 20, and her husband shared a provision shop with a few friends. They had 7 children, born in  the 1930s and early 1940s. Unfortunately Mdm Koh Lee was widowed at the age of 38. She borrowed some money from her mother, who sold her house at old Jurong Road. Her elder son stopped schooling to work and support the family. Two of the younger children were able to complete secondary school, unlike the older children. Most of the 35 grandchildren however went on to get a tertiary education. With each generation, life became better.
Mdm Koh Lee now has more than ten great-great grandchildren. Lunar New Year becomes more special every year."

Singapore is not perfect, but that makes us want to make it better. And we will go forward to an even better Singapore through everyone’s ideas, and everyone’s efforts and care.

Please share your ideas on how we should mark Singapore’s 50th year of nationhood at the Singapore50 website (www.Singapore50.sg).  

Think of ourselves. Think of our families and friends. How Singapore has made each of us what we are, and how each of us can do something to make Singapore what we want it to be.  

I can tell you that I am what I am as a person because of how I grew up in the Singapore of the 60s and 70s. It made me. Many things, some big, some small, but they all added up -  the time spent on sports fields, for some years almost daily, winning and losing with my teammates; the time at the street-side hawker stalls after our games; often standing on the steps on the bus, and sometimes getting stares when the long T-squares that we used for technical drawing classes accidentally poked into others; the barbers who offered us two styles (I always chose the ‘square cut’); the great charm of Beauty World market -  by the way, no one actually called it that  -  it was either ‘Chit Ko’ or Batu Tujoh (7th mile); the joys of day-dreaming, and the simplicity of life because there was little on TV and no internet. 

None of us who grew up then knew what Singapore would become a few decades later. But there was a growing Singapore spirit -  we somehow knew we could achieve something with effort, and we did.
    
Heng Swee Keat and his SG50 committee launched SG50 yesterday with a call for ideas for our 50th birthday, everywhere in Singapore. Some of what Swee Keat said:-  

“ 50 is a time of deep humility about ourselves, honour for our elders, and hope for the young…..

……..To truly celebrate as one people, it is about getting many people – everyone, I hope – to come alive with ideas.  ….We would love to see Singaporeans take ownership of SG50 and organise your own celebrations and activities of all kinds…

If you have ideas that will help us all celebrate in a truly Singaporean spirit, please come forward and share them, and make this really our celebration…… 

….If your ideas need some kind of support, the SG50 Celebration Fund Evaluation Panel, which is made up of members from the people and private sectors, will look into funding ideas up to $50,000 per project, or 90% of the costs….  

We encourage you to share your ideas at the Singapore50 website (www.Singapore50.sg). You will also be able to drop your suggestions into physical ideas collection boxes located at all community centres, public libraries and museums.”

496904023672427_764542603575233,"The sporting world mourns the loss of Eusebio today, at age 71. He was “one of the greatest football players ever” as Franz Beckenbauer, himself an outstanding player of the time, tweeted. 

For those who have followed the football of the 60s, Eusebio, nick-named the Black Panther, was quite unusual. He was not very tall, but was extremely fast and had exceptionally large quadriceps. He had the most ferocious and deadly-accurate right-foot shots, that made him one of the best free-kick takers in history.
  
Eusebio’s background is interesting.  He was born into poverty in Mozambique, at that time a Portuguese colony in southern Africa. His father was a white Angolan and his mother a black Mozambican. He would skip school to play barefoot with his friends in improvised pitches and with ‘footballs’ made of newspapers and socks. He was spotted in his teens, and eventually lured by the Portuguese club Benfica when he was 18. He went on to play for Portugal, and became one of the world’s most prolific goal-scorers.

Eusebio is best known for being top-scorer in the 1966 World Cup. Although Eusebio scored, Portugal lost in the semi-finals 1-2 against England. The match has been shown many times over, to generations of football fans. Eusebio wept as he walked off the field, comforted by both his teammates and his English opponents. The match is known as Jogo das Lágrimas (Game of Tears) in Portugal.
 
Eusebio also brought glory to Mozambique, and is still viewed as the greatest African player ever. The former President of Mozambique and childhood friend of Eusebio, Joaquim Chissano, said today ""I lost a friend, when we were kids we used to play together, we played football together… Football connected Portugal and Mozambique. Eusébio was a pride to the Mozambican people.""
 
Eusebio -  a true sportsman who brought beauty to the game."

“No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite” -  Nelson Mandela (1918 – 2013)
 
I took this photo at the Memorial Service for Nelson Mandela on Dec 10, where I represented Singapore. It was held in pelting rain, but in South African tradition (like some of ours), the rain was a blessing. “It opens the gates of heaven”, and they considered it a welcome for Mandela.
  
A few more words about the memorial, for a leader whose passing was mourned by millions around the world, in fact like no other in the last fifty years. 

The memorial was held at a huge soccer stadium in Soweto, in the south-western outskirts of Johannesburg. Soweto has a significant place in history. It was and still is a large black African township, one of several formed after black Africans were evicted from designated white areas under apartheid. It was also the site of the Soweto Uprising in 1976, when mass protests erupted over the suppression of education for blacks, including the government's policy to enforce education in Afrikaans (the language of the European settlers) rather than English.
  
The burden of apartheid is unfortunately deep, and overcoming it has been difficult. Segregated living and greatly unequal opportunities remain the reality, two decades after democratic elections enabling people of all races to vote. Nelson Mandela’s long walk is over, but the journey from the injustices of apartheid continues."

""I have ordered a Committee of Inquiry (COI) to look into the Little India riot. The COI will review the factors that led to the incident, how the incident was handled, and how we manage areas where foreign workers congregate. 

This was an isolated incident caused by an unruly mob. The vast majority of foreign workers here obey our laws. We must not let this bad incident tarnish our views of foreigner workers here. Nor should we condone hateful or xenophobic comments, especially online.

Let us remain calm and continue with our daily lives. Support our Home Team officers on the front line, and share with them any leads you may have. We must unite to deal with this unfortunate incident, to keep Singapore orderly and safe. - LHL""

One of its teachers had visited a school in Japan and found no cleaners. In Japan it’s been the daily routine in every school. The youngest kids clean their classrooms at the end of the day. By the time they are in upper primary, they clean everything outside. They learn something very naturally -  about responsibility, and about respect for every job. And it becomes second nature for the Japanese -  keeping public places litter-free, and cleaning up when something is spilled.

We are improving the job and raising wages for our cleaners, who deserve better. But we must also change attitudes, starting from young.

Marsiling Primary is taking the lead to inculcate these attitudes. It will be working with NEA. Hope more schools follow."
496904023672427_725694750793352,"A Happy Deepavali to all Hindu Singaporeans and everyone who celebrates the festival! 

The photo is typical of the intricate temple reliefs in Prambanan in Central Java, built around the 9th  century. It is the largest Hindu temple complex in Southeast Asia besides Angkor Wat in Cambodia, which came 3 centuries later.  

I am in Yogyakarta this weekend with 90 community volunteers from Taman Jurong. The two UNESCO world heritage sites in the surroundings of the city, Borobudur and Prambanan, are hugely inspiring.  They were built by the Central Javanese kingdoms of the era, and reflect both their Indian influences and  remarkable Javanese artistry.  

But Borobudur and Prambanan’s significance is not just architectural, and not just as Buddhist and Hindu temple complexes respectively.  They are a centrepiece of Southeast Asia’s heritage, and part of the layers of culture, religion and spirituality that make that heritage. They also reflect the co-existence that enriched the region. The Hindu temple complex at Prambanan is near numerous smaller Buddhist temples, besides Borobudur itself which is not far away. Th alternating Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms of Central Java's Mataram dynasty did not destroy what had come before them.

Both Borobudur and Prambanan fell into neglect after the 10th century, most likely because of ash from volcanic eruptions, and the shift of power from Central to West Java. They were eventually covered by jungle and lay forgotten for centuries. When Java was briefly under British administration from 1811 to 1816, a surveyor working for Stamford Raffles came upon their ruins. Proper restoration began only in 1930, and major work only since the 1970s with the efforts of UNESCO and the Indonesian authorities. Unfortunately many valuable pieces in the temples have been stolen over the years, including a large number of the Buddha heads in Borobudur. 

Prambanan was badly affected by another major earthquake in 2006. The three main temples  -  dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma -  have been largely restored. But much of the reconstruction of Prambanan remains to be done."
496904023672427_714655965230564,"Selamat Hari Raya Haji to all our Muslim friends! The early morning downpour freshened the air. Some notes on this festive day which I posted last year are below. 
The photo is another matter. My favourite cake when it comes to Malay festivities has always been kueh salat.  The custard made from santan (coconut milk) and pandan leaves, on top of glutinous rice, is a unique combination -  soft and tough, rich but not too sweet. Delicious, and not lethal if you have it occasionally.
  
The traditional version, which is still made  by the ‘true blue’ kueh-makers, has bluish patches in the rice, made from blue pea flowers.
 
Kueh salat is usually thought to be a local nonya creation, although some people say it was originally Javanese.  In Malaysia they call it ‘kuih seri muka’. Either way, the kueh is probably a combination of influences – in fact just like these names themselves reflect Malay, Chinese and Indian influences.  In Melaka, they call it Gading Galoh. I don’t know what that means, but gading happens to be Dutch for taste or liking.   

As children, we looked forward to each of our festive holidays for the foods. Not everyone knows the full meaning of each festivity and its special practices, but we know it is of deep significance to some of our fellow citizens. The festivals are part of the rhythm of life that makes us Singaporean.  

The Malay name that we use for this holiday, Hari Raya Haji, comes from the fact that it occurs on the culmination of the Haj, or pilgrimage to Mecca. The Tamil Muslims say Haji Peru Nāl. The Arabic name refers to the act of sacrifice - Eid al-Adha, or Feast of the Sacrifice. Locally too, it is now common to say Hari Raya Eiduladha. 

Muslim volunteers perform the sacrificial slaughtering of sheep at our mosques after the congregational prayers in the morning. The sacrificial slaughtering, known as korban, is done in remembrance of the willingness of Ibrahim to follow Allah's (God’s) command to sacrifice his son. (There is a similar biblical story of Abraham in the Christian Old Testament, and an account in the Jewish Torah too). 

The meat is distributed to relatives, neighbours and especially the needy. It is done as a reminder to share one's wealth and blessings with others.

496904023672427_709227709106723,"Living a life of character and purpose. Iskandar Jalil, Singapore’s master potter, now 73. Still actively creating, still drawing on new influences, still looking for different types of clay, still the teacher, busy planning for exhibitions and trips for his students. And still that unusual mix of absolute discipline and irreverence.  I regard Iskandar as one of our most inspiring Singaporeans. 

Iskandar himself always talks about what he owes his own master, Hibi-sensei, under whom he was apprentice in the early 70s in Tajimi, Gifu Prefecture in Japan under a Colombo Plan scholarship. He goes back to Tajimi every year on an “annual pilgrimage” to visit his teacher and foster parents from those years.  What is less well known is that Iskandar also spent a few years in the late 60s in Allahabad University in India, learning textile design, also under a Colombo Plan scholarship  - I just learnt this when I met him again yesterday.   

Some things about Iskandar’s early life, before he got involved in pottery, also have to do with the person he came to be. He grew up in Kampong Chantek (then a very large kampong); was active in sports especially hockey, badminton and soccer; did exceptionally well as a student at Victoria School; taught at Telok Kurau and Jalan Daud schools; and was even a Vespa rally champion in Singapore. I discovered this from the essays in his latest book, Images of My Pottery Journeys, which describes his personal journey.*  

It was just a dialogue, 
then a conversation, 
but now it is a sacred conversation. 
Nothing can interrupt
this private talk
between clay and me!

(Iskandar Jalil, in Images of My Pottery Travels, 2011)

Lots of young people with friends, and families with kids. Plus quite a few older Singaporeans enjoying the evening.

The photo: a story of  interfaith civilisation. A Muslim mausoleum and minaret sitting beside a church, each over 5 centuries old, in the town of Bolgar in Tatarstan. Islam and Christianity have co-existed within communities and extended families over long periods in Tatarstan. (Click to see the full picture: minaret in the middle, mausoleum on the right.)
 
Tatarstan is now an autonomous, Muslim-majority Russian republic – in fact right in the middle of Russia. I was there over a weekend in June with a business delegation. Tatarstan President Rustam Minnikhanov insisted that I not only visit their technology parks, but go to the old towns of Bolgar and Sviyazhsk to see how his government was restoring both churches and mosques that had been damaged or destroyed over time. They had also restored the Holy Dormition Monastery in Sviyazhsk, which Stalin had converted into a Gulag or forced labour camp for 20 years during the communist period.
 
The people are of  different ethnic origins - largely Tatars of Turkic and Mongol origin, and Russian. The Tatars have been mainly Sunni Muslims since the 10th century, the Russians are Orthodox Christians. 

I was struck by how modern and outward-looking the people are today, determined to progress through openness to the world.
  
Each time we come across such examples, it restores our belief in interfaith civilisation, despite the efforts of extremists and ideologues of many persuasions.

496904023672427_618451091517719,"A broader meritocracy. Where we treat each other with equal respect.

I gave a long interview to The Straits Times. One of the questions concerned the kind of Singapore I hope to see in 20 years. (The link to the video on the Singapolitics website is at the end of this post.)

Some of what I said and believe: 

We are still a little too much of a hierarchy based on what happened to you at age 18, what scores you had, what qualifications you had, which course you could go to. So we are a meritocracy that's still too much defined by what happened in your school years or your post-secondary years. 

There are some societies which are not meritocratic enough in the school system…the US is an example, public schools in bad shape, giving a bad deal to ordinary kids, and then they've got private schools that provide a high quality of education. Not meritocratic. 

But there's something in the workplace culture that I think we can learn from in the US, Japan and some places in Europe, where there is respect for people in different vocations, they treat each other a little more as equals.

We've got to be a broader meritocracy, recognising different strengths in different individuals, but also a continuous meritocracy where it doesn't matter so much what happened when you were in Sec 4 or JC 2 or when you finished your Poly or ITE, but what happens after that. Are you continually improving, are you developing mastery? Regardless of where you start, we have to recognise what you’ve achieved to develop mastery in what you are doing. 

It's about recognising the role that everyone plays in keeping the society going. Every job counts and improving on every job is what this is about. Respect mastery in every job, respect hard work in every job - that has to be our culture.

20 years from now? I hope it’ll be a Singapore where we treat each other as equals.

About those in the photo: They are amongst the Singaporeans who work at the Rolls-Royce Seletar Campus that I visited recently. It is staffed mainly by Singaporeans. They had gone through extensive training, with several having gone to Derby in the UK, where Rolls Royce does similarly advanced manufacturing. Tony Woo (on the extreme left) and John Isaac (extreme right) are team leaders in the assembly of the Trent engines which are used on the A380 Airbus. Mohd Noor Osman (pictured removing his spectacles) and Muhammad Hafizan beside him are also leaders, in the manufacturing of the wide-chord fan blades that go into these latest engines. They are responsible for perfecting quality -   inspecting the fan blades for microscopic  imperfections, using optical technology (the large piece of equipment behind them uses what the engineers call GOM, or geometric optical measurement technology). Tony and Mohd Noor had obtained diplomas some years ago; Mohd Hafizan and John graduated from ITE. They had each spent some years in related jobs, and worked their way up to positions of responsibility. Just listening to each of them, you can tell how proud they are of their work. Makes us all proud too.

We are transforming our economy so that we can have quality growth – growth that all Singaporeans will benefit from, and which will allow a better quality of life. And we are taking further steps towards a more inclusive society – starting with the kids, helping lower-income workers, and providing greater economic security for our retirees, including those in the middle-income group.

Here's an extract from the Budget Speech that sets out the main directions our policies are taking. The specifics are in the full speech linked below.

BETTER SINGAPORE: QUALITY GROWTH, AN INCLUSIVE SOCIETY
 
Many Singaporeans, through Our Singapore Conversation platforms, have been sharing their hopes for Singapore – the kind of home we want to build for our families and our children. There has been a rich diversity of views. But a common set of aspirations is emerging, a common vision of the future that Singaporeans want:
•	A home with a strong Singaporean identity and sense of belonging 
•	A Singapore with a robust and vibrant economy, and with good jobs that enable a more fulfilling pace of life 
•	A home with strong families, and where our seniors can age with dignity
•	A society that takes care of the disadvantaged
•	A Singapore with affordable living 
•	A society with greater sense of togetherness, and where the Government and the people have a more collaborative relationship

This is the Singapore that we want to build together.
 
The Government is making major moves to support this endeavour. Since 2010, we have embarked on major steps to transform our economy so as to create better jobs and allow for a better pace and quality of life. We are also making important shifts in social policies, as announced in last year’s Budget, to foster a fair and more inclusive society.
 
We will need to make further moves. So that by the end of the decade, we will have a better Singapore, a better future for all Singaporeans.
 
Immediate Challenges: Housing and Transport

First, we have pressing challenges in housing and transport. The Government will spare no effort in resolving these problems. 
We want to reduce the cost of housing relative to the income of young Singaporeans. Prices in the HDB resale market and private market have risen too rapidly in the cycle that began as we recovered from the 2009 economic crisis. We have taken major steps to cool the housing market. We have also ramped up the supply of HDB flats which will help first-time buyers book their flats faster as well as ease prices in the resale market. And we have increased supply of private housing through Government Land Sales. The Minister for National Development will speak more in COS about these immediate challenges as well as how we can ensure affordable, quality housing for Singaporeans over the longer term.
 
We have to make many improvements in public transport. Congestion and waiting times are a daily problem for Singaporeans. We are ramping up bus capacity, especially feeder services, to improve frequency and add new routes. We are accelerating the rollout of the additional 800 buses that we made provisions for last year. In addition, the Land Transport Authority will be tendering out routes to private operators.
 
Our rail network will expand by more than 50% by 2021. That is still eight years away. But in the meantime, we will see improvements that will help relieve congestion. Parts of the Downtown Line will start operating from the end of this year, and new trains will be added to existing lines from next year. We will also introduce other measures to reduce crowding, including significantly enhanced incentives for commuters who travel during the “shoulder” periods before and after the morning peak hour. The Minister for Transport will talk about these measures in the COS.
 
An Economy and Society in Transition

While we fix these immediate problems in housing and transport, we have to press on with our priorities to help Singaporeans have a better quality of life over the medium to long term.
 
We have to shift gears for an economy and society that is in transition.

We are no longer a developing economy, but we have not achieved the level of productivity and income of an advanced economy. At the same time, our own workforce is growing more slowly, and is gradually getting older.
 
We must make every effort to achieve quality growth: growth that is achieved mainly through innovation and higher productivity, and growth that will benefit all Singaporeans – our children, working families, our elderly and disabled.
 
Our strategies for achieving quality growth and an inclusive society are in fact tied inextricably together. Raising productivity is not just our most important economic priority, but enables us to build a better society. Higher productivity is the only sustainable way to raise incomes for ordinary Singaporeans, and provide jobs that give people a sense of responsibility and empowerment. Higher productivity is also necessary for us to shorten working hours over time and allow Singaporeans to enjoy a better work-life balance.

Our society is also facing the pressures of widening income disparities. This is happening in cities globally and in Asia, but it matters more to us because Singapore is not just a city but also a nation. We must take further steps to temper inequality. We also want to do more to enable our seniors to have a sense of economic security and fulfilment in their retirement years.
 
On both economy and society, therefore, we need to shift our thinking. 
In government: where we are reshaping policies and driving new initiatives, especially to sustain social mobility and strengthen support for older Singaporeans. 
In the business community: which has to innovate and adjust to the permanent reality of a tight labour market. 
In our society at large: where we have to accord ordinary workers not just better pay but greater respect. 
In the community: with non-profits and other voluntary groups pursuing the causes we all believe in, and working with an active partner in the government. 
And for all of us individuals, to do our best to improve and to contribute to our country in our own ways.
 
Transforming Our Economy for Better Jobs
We are restructuring our economy. We began this in earnest in 2010, by: 
•	Tightening foreign worker inflows;
•	Supporting enterprises in their efforts to upgrade operations and improve productivity; and 
•	Investing in our workers by heavily subsidising their training, in every skill.

We need to intensify this economic restructuring and skills upgrading so as to achieve quality growth. Although wages are going up in a tight labour market, productivity has lagged. If we do not do better in raising productivity, we will be caught in a situation where businesses lose competitiveness, and wages eventually stagnate. Both workers and businesses will be worse off.
 
We must help our SME sector revitalise itself. There are however wide divergences in efficiency amongst SMEs even in the same industries. Restructuring will unfortunately lead to some businesses being winnowed out, but the end result must be a vibrant and sustainable local SME sector. Every support must be provided to help the businesses which bring in more efficient techniques and service models, so they can grow in a tight labour market, and where possible make their mark internationally.

There are already many examples of SMEs transforming themselves, in every sector. For example in furniture manufacturing, local firms are training multi-skilled employees, relocating manpower-intensive activities, developing unique brands and carving a niche for themselves in overseas markets.
  
To make this economic transition, we must also harness the value of older Singaporeans and design jobs suited for them, as well as for other potential employees who are unable to work regular, full-time schedules. Flexible work practices must become more common, enabling employees to structure their work so that they have time for their families or for personal development like part-time courses. We should also make it possible for more employees to have the option of telecommuting from home or working from “smart work centres” near their homes, like what they have in Amsterdam and Seoul. The Government will work closely with businesses in these efforts.

Building a Fair and Inclusive Society

We are also taking major steps to ensure a fair and more inclusive society.
  
•	First, to sustain social mobility. Meritocracy alone will not assure us of this. We therefore want to do more, starting from early in our children’s lives, to give the best leg up to those who start with a disadvantage. We cannot change the fact that children have different family backgrounds that bring very different advantages and disadvantages. But we want to find every way, at the pre-school and primary school levels, to help our children from poorer or less stable families to develop confidence and the self-belief that gives them aspirations of their own, and to help them catch up when they fall behind. And we will provide pathways to develop every skill and ability, so that every child can discover his strengths as he grows up, and can do well.
 
•	Second, we must do more to mitigate inequality. We are making our fiscal system more progressive, by tilting our taxes and benefits in favour of the lower- and middle-income groups.

Currently:

i.	A lower-income older worker receives a significant top-up of his income through Workfare each year.
 
ii.	A middle-income family with a child in child care gets subsidies of $4,800 per year. If the child is in university, he can receive more than $8,500 in bursaries over the course of his studies, and get a subsidised government loan to pay off the remaining fees and cover study expenses. Children from lower-income families receive far more.

iii.	Singaporeans with disabilities now receive substantially greater support. Both when young through early intervention under EIPIC,  and as adults, where we provide a substantial incentive through the Special Employment Credit (SEC) for firms to employ them so that they can contribute and lead more independent lives.
  
iv.	An older Singaporean in need of long term care can receive subsidies of $870 per month for home-based care or $1,200 per month if he is in a nursing home, following the changes we introduced last year. Those who need more help will get it through Medifund.

We will take further, significant steps in this Budget towards strengthening social mobility and increasing the progressivity and fairness of our system. In particular, with enhancements to Workfare, a low-wage worker who is 60 years old would receive a top-up of his pay of about 30%. This is in addition to what his employer can receive through the SEC, and the new Wage Credit Scheme, to be introduced in this year’s Budget, which will encourage his employer to up his pay.

While raising incomes is the best way to help lower- and middle- income Singaporeans cope with rising costs, this Budget will also include measures to help them more immediately. The most significant support will go to older Singaporeans, to help them with medical costs.
  
Taking all our measures together, including those which will be announced in this Budget, we are providing substantial benefits to lower- and middle-income Singaporeans. The full picture can be seen if we look at benefits over a lifetime, starting from a couple’s needs when they first have children, to the time they get old and need other types of help, especially with healthcare costs.

In total, over a lifetime, a young low-income couple with two children can expect to receive more than $600,000 in benefits in real terms (2013 dollars). (This comes from subsidies and other means-tested benefits for their children’s education, housing, healthcare, Workfare, the GST Voucher, and other schemes.) 

This is much more than we used to provide in the past. In the last decade alone, we have more than doubled the lifetime benefits in real terms for such families.
 
When we take into account all the taxes that such low-income families will pay (mainly GST), they will get back far more in benefits. In fact, they will get more than five dollars in benefits for every dollar in taxes paid.
 
However, today’s generation of older Singaporeans will not benefit as much as younger Singaporeans from the enhancements in Workfare and CPF and other schemes. We want to do more for this senior generation of Singaporeans, who worked over the years, often with low pay, to build a better future for their children. They made today’s Singapore possible. We will do more for them. The Government is reviewing the system of healthcare financing and some other schemes to help them in their retirement years.

Finally, the Budget will make significant investments to nurture the sports and arts, which play a growing role in enriching life in Singapore. Over the next five years, we will invest 30% more in sports programmes, and more than double our investments to develop regional- and community-level sports facilities. The Government will also create a new Cultural Donation Matching Fund, to provide dollar-for-dollar matching for donations to the arts and culture.

In short, we are building a better Singapore: a more inclusive and caring society, with an innovative and dynamic economy, so that Singaporeans can have better opportunities and more fulfilling lives.

496904023672427_585926951436800,"The photo tells the story. The reunion dinner, on the eve of the  Lunar New Year becomes more special each year for the Piong family. Mr Piong Chau Kon is  97, his wife 10 years younger. They have had a good life. And their story is in many ways like that of many other  Singapore families. 

Piong Chau Kon grew up in a remote village in Guangzhou. He had 2 1/2 years of education and worked on a farm. He later moved to Swatow to be an apprentice to a tailor, before venturing out to Malaya. He and his wife met in Malacca, started a family, then moved down to Singapore. They lived in Choa Chu Kang, and survived the hardships of the Japanese Occupation. When the Japanese left, he worked as a tailor serving the British soldiers at the RAF Tengah airbase. Later he took over his employer’s shop. Then the British  withdrew, and the Piongs moved to Taman Jurong. It was a newly developing estate,  together with Jurong Industrial Estate, and he set up Willy’s Tailor in Sept 1967. The family has lived in Jurong since, and  seen life improve, decade after decade. 

The Piongs are now a big, joyful family  -  9 children, 21 grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren and now 1 great-great grandchild.  Everyone hopes there will be more great and great-great grandchildren. 

Something else that’s wonderful. Piong Chau Kon published a book last year at age 96, called ‘My Memoirs’. He gave me a copy. It started when he began writing random bits and pieces of his memories, and became a detailed recollection of a lifelong of experiences. So that the younger ones in the family would know. 

Each generation must know what happened before. Each generation will carry its own memories and hopes. Each generation of Singaporeans will create the future Singapore.  

Warmest wishes to everyone celebrating the Lunar New Year, and to all other Singaporeans who enjoy the festive spirit and the time with our families!"
496904023672427_569018386460990,"We opened Our Museum@Taman Jurong over the weekend. A wonderful addition to the community  -  a museum close to where people live and go to school, and part of our community life.  We made it a modular structure -  a set of three containers -  so that we can move the containers from one place to another in Jurong over time. There was so much interest from residents, who came and stayed for hours taking part in the activities around the place.
 
Our Museum@Taman Jurong is the first such community museum, a partnership between the Taman Jurong grassroots, the National Heritage Board (NHB) and other agencies. Next, NHB will  launch a community museum in Kolam Ayer later this year, that will build  on the special heritage of that area. Over time, these community museums and galleries will enrich Singapore’s cultural landscape, and become new arts spaces that people can ‘own’ and  enjoy in the neighbourhoods.
 
The artworks at Our Museum@Taman Jurong were curated by the Singapore Art Museum. They include pieces from Singapore’s national collection, which are usually only displayed in our national museums, and which provide different perspectives of the social changes we have seen as a nation. There are also other displays which reflect the unique heritage and character of Taman Jurong, plus short films and recent photographs of our residents at various locations in our neighbourhood. Some things to capture the spirit and daily lives of our people. 

Taman Jurong has a unique place in independent Singapore’s history. This was where the first flats were built in the late 60s and early 70s to house workers in the new Jurong industrial estate and their families.  Many came in from kampongs around the area. It is where we had the famous drive-in cinema, where courting couples went, supposedly to watch the movies. It was where we had the first two built-up hawker centres in Singapore, including the famous Market One at Corporation Drive, and where we created the Chinese and Japanese Gardens in the early 70s in Jurong Lake, and Jurong Bird Park nearby, to provide leisure for families who were settling into the Jurong area. Many of the original residents and hawkers are still with us today. Some of the children have moved out, but many have moved back in with their own families. There is a certain spirit to the place. 
 
Our Museum@Taman Jurong will also be a space for people to develop their own interests in the arts. Several residents  have been working with local visual artist Speak Cryptic (Farizwan) in mural painting. They had no background in mural painting at all, but some have developed a real love for it. Others have been working with film-maker Sanif Olek. Sanif is a son of Jurong - he grew up here. Like some other artists and photographers who live in the area and have been happy to come forward as volunteers.  
 
All ideas are welcome, as we invite people - young and old -  to come in and appreciate art or try their hand at creating something themselves."
496904023672427_567502603279235,"I was touched yesterday when an elderly Chinese resident came up to me in Taman Jurong to extend her wishes for the Pongal festival, which is to be celebrated today. Pongal is not as well known among non-Indians as Thaipusam and Deepavali. But it is a significant festival for the Tamils and others of South Indian origin.

Pongal is  an ancient harvest festival that is still celebrated actively today, even by communities who left the farms generations ago. It has become a celebration of cultural heritage and community. 

It is also the only major Indian festival that is based on the movement of the sun, rather than the moon. It marks the beginning of the northward journey of the Sun from its southernmost-limit.  That’s also why the kolam designs on the floor outside homes on Pongal day are often about the sun. 

Literally, Pongal in Tamil means ""boiling over"" or ""spill over"". Its meaning is similar to the biblical ‘my cup runneth over’. Milk is traditionally boiled in a pot on this day, and its boiling over symbolizes abundance and happiness. 

What children prefer, however, is another meaning of Pongal -   the name of a sweet dish of rice boiled with lentils which is eaten on this day. Quite delicious. 

Happy Pongal to those who celebrate it and to everyone else who loves our diverse, multicultural society!"
496904023672427_567373659958796,"Our restaurants are having great difficulty finding employees. Today’s Sunday Times has a feature on this. Some restaurants have raised pay to attract part-timers during the peak Lunar New Year season. But most still have difficulty finding  people, because the overall labour market is close to full employment. 

These are real problems for businesses, but the solution is not to ease up on foreign worker policies. The solution has to be more fundamental. Those who have been in restaurants or coffee bars in the US or Europe or Japan can see the difference. They have fewer workers, but are able to do well. The same employee handles more duties, and serves more tables. The employees are well-paid, both full-time and part-time.  They know their stuff, including  details of the dishes  on the menu, and are well trained.  The restaurants also employ older workers, give them good jobs with some adjustments where required, and customers treat them with respect. And the employees wear their uniforms with pride. 

Well-trained; proud of their jobs; well-paid.  That’s what productivity is about. Our level of productivity is well below that in the most developed countries. Even HK uses fewer workers in its restaurants than we do in Singapore.

Consumers too have to adjust, because the higher wages of waiters and kitchen staff in these countries often means higher prices compared to Singapore. But with higher productivity, price increases can be minimised even with wages going up.  That’s why productivity is the key to upgrading our incomes and standard of living.  

Even with our tighter foreign worker policies, we will need foreign workers in the restaurants and other businesses which cannot find enough Singaporeans. But the fundamental and sustainable solution is to transform the jobs. Everyone has to play their part: The employers to transform the way businesses run and share productivity gains with their employees through higher pay. Employees to pick up skills and keep learning on the job. The Government to keep our foreign worker policy tight, but at the same time lend strong  support to help this upgrading and upskilling in every sector.  And customers too playing their part by treating workers in ordinary jobs with respect, everywhere we meet them.   

I met the waiter in the photo, Detlef Gurnior, at a café in Berlin when I was there for a couple of days in December during my annual family holiday.  He is 73  -  he had a good laugh when I asked him if he was 65 - that’s the way he looked. He was proud of his job, and it showed when he spoke. I watched him moving around  -  taking orders from many tables, handling the bills, even moving chairs to match the number of customers at a table. He had a broad smile for every customer, and they had a smile for him. 

The cafe had few workers, but was doing very well. We have some restaurants like that in Singapore too, but we need many more like that."
496904023672427_557495110946651,"This is the photo of the bridge in Mostar, destroyed then rebuilt, that I wrote about in the piece I just posted."
496904023672427_557493497613479,"Warmest wishes to Christians and for the spirit of fraternity amongst all of us as we celebrate Christmas! 

I am on my annual family holiday. We decided to visit Bosnia and Croatia. They are part of the Balkans, a region of Catholics, Orthodox Christians and Muslims. It is a beautiful region, with deep cultures. Bosnia especially is where eastern cultures met western, Islam met Christianity, Catholics met Orthodox Christians.  But the region is also where the first great human tragedy of post-communist Europe occurred  -  after  the death of Tito, who had held them all together under the Yugoslavian federation.

It was always a difficult history, with old and unresolved grievances between Catholic Croats, Orthodox Serbs and mainly Muslim Bosnians being revived from time to time. They are all mainly Slavs ethnically, but with different religions that came over the centuries. Religion has been mixed with nationalist sentiments and attempts to seize territory and political power. The Serbs and Croats engaged in genocidal struggle during the Second World War. Yugoslavia and communism suppressed this for a while. In the more recent tragedy two decades ago, the Croats fought the Serbs, and both then fought the Bosnian Muslims who were the largest victims.     

Today's Bosnia-Herzogovina is a solution that came after the recent conflicts. It is a country partitioned according to three nationalities, the Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats. Forced resettlement of people and brutal ‘ethnic cleansing’ have led to them occupying three different regions of the country now, whereas many towns previously had people of different religions living together and often intermarrying. 

Some scholars think that the core of the problem in Bosnia after Yugoslavia began breaking apart was that its political leaders chose to form parties organised along religious lines.  The politics fostered memories of ancient strife, and gave little chance of forming a common nationality.  

The wounds of the tragedy two decades ago are still there, when you speak to ordinary people. They speak immediately about it, because everyone experienced the tragedy. But they are making an effort to live in peace. In Kosovo, which is almost entirely Muslim, the whole country celebrates Christmas -  not in a religious way but as a cultural and national event. They try to recall the positives of the past too. In Sarajevo in Bosnia, a few Muslims told me about how the Serb (Christian) neighbours had fought alongside them to defend the town they had lived in all their lives from attacks by Serbian forces. There were many acts of friendship amongst ordinary people.  

What about these photos? I took them in Mostar, a majestic city  in Bosnia. Mostar was famous during the Second World War because its people of different religions resisted the hatreds elsewhere in the region.  But it was different in this last war. One of the most symbolic acts of hatred was when a group of Bosnian Croat soldiers destroyed a four centuries-old Ottoman bridge in 1993, with artillery fire.  The bridge is said to have been the widest stone arch in the world in its time when it was first built, and an architectural wonder. Scholars say there was little military advantage in bringing down the bridge, and the act was really aimed at destroying cultural heritage and inflicting pschological damage. 

Everywhere in Bosnia, the different communities now regard the destruction of this famed bridge with sorrow. It was rebuilt a decade later -  an international effort, with several European countries and UNESCO helping. They wanted to build a bridge as similar as possible to the original, using the old construction techniques and same materials. Hungarian army divers recovered stones from the original bridge from the river-bed below. Other stones came from the local mountains. 

The new bridge (in the photo) is beautiful as it archs across the Neretva river. It connects a divided Mostar -   Muslim Bosnians on one side with Catholic Croats on the other. The other photo, of two hands reaching out to each other, is of a painting displayed in a building near the restored bridge. It is their statement of hope of bridging the communities in Mostar. (The painting is a reproduction of part of Michelangelo’s painting of ‘Creation of Man’ in the Sistine Chapel in Rome.)

Two days ago we also heard of Islamist extremists destroying mausoleums in another historic city, Timbuktu in Mali. Timbuktu was a centre of Islamic learning from the 13th to 17th centuries. It is a UN World Heritage Site, with its mausoleums dedicated to saints revered by the Sufi Muslims. Another tragedy, another case of extreme hubris, as people not only seek to impose their beliefs on others but to erase centuries of history in one act. 

Christmas like our other celebrations is a good time to remember how valuable it is to keep the togetherness of minds, and keep building and preserving bridges between our beliefs. For peace, for cohesion and betterment for all within our own societies, and for our shared humanity."
496904023672427_540656055963890,"Nothing like a performer who sings from the heart. Last night, it was Muhammad Naser Bin Hamid, doing his version of “The Climb”. He spent several years in Prison, and was released this July. 

Naser sang from the heart.  For those who don’t know the song, it starts this way: 

I can almost see it
That dream I am dreaming
But there's a voice inside my head saying
""You'll never reach it""

Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels
Lost with no direction
My faith is shaking

But I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be a uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose

Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb…..

496904023672427_536762533019909,"People often wonder why Deepavali is called the Festival of Lights. Or why those who celebrate Deepavali have oil lamps lit up in their homes, often through the night. 

Depending on the region in India, there are in fact different legends behind this practice. There are different interpretations of the rituals surrounding Deepavali (or Diwali as it is called in northern India).  But the essence is the same:  Deepavali celebrates efforts to end ignorance, or darkness, by the gaining of knowledge and compassion, or light. 
 
Hindus believe that the outward display of lamps on this special day recognises the inner light in each person, a light that commits him or her to upholding truth and performing good deeds.  

Many non-Hindus are able to appreciate the symbolism of Deepavali this way, as the meaning of light and its association with truth and goodness is really universal.  

By the way, the name Deepavali comes from the ancient Sanskrit language -  literally meaning a row of lights (‘Deepa’ meaning light; ‘avali’ meaning a row). In northern Indian states, Deepavali  was shortened to Diwali.  

The festival goes back to early times, and comes at the end of the harvest period.  Interestingly, besides the Hindus, the Sikhs, Jains and even some Buddhists in India commemorate Diwali, for different reasons. Some people hence view Deepavali/Diwali as being both a religious festival and a celebration of cultural identity amongst Indians or those of Indian origin.

Incidentally, the day after Deepavali this year will coincide with the start of Muharram or the new year in the Muslim calendar.  While Deepavali, like Chinese New Year, falls on the day of the new moon, the Muslims commemorate Muharram on the day after the new moon.  

Happy Deepavali to all Hindus, and others who celebrate this festival of lights!"
496904023672427_530837076945788,"I made known my views last Sunday on some refinements we should consider in our schools, especially in the PSLE system and how children are posted to secondary schools.  The basic idea is to rank students less finely, and to reduce an excessive focus on examinations early in life. This is a complex matter, and any change has to be studied very carefully.  It would build on the changes we have made in the last decade. We have to create real space in education for children to develop their character and the ability to think for themselves. That includes more time outside the classroom, more time to discover different talents, and more chances to interact across different races and social backgrounds as they grow up. The excerpts of what I said are below.

----------------------------------------------------------------
What can education really impart? What will stay with our children well after they leave school?  

I believe the value that we can bring through education lies in nurturing three main attributes among our young: 
- First, strength of character. This is at the core of what makes vibrant society. MOE is giving renewed emphasis to this key attribute; 
- Second, the skills and knowledge required to participate with confidence in the modern economy, and to pick up new skills later in life;
- Third, the ability to think for themselves and think in original ways. This can only come about if it is a habit from young - a habit of constantly questioning, reading up on their own, discussing alternatives. 

I believe we are doing quite well in the second of these three areas - skills and knowledge. We are doing well based on international standards, although we must keep up with the times, so that the broad majority of students are prepared to take on new jobs and do well.  

Where we have to do more is with regards to the other two areas -  developing strength of character and encouraging students to think in original ways. 

But it is only possible to progress in these areas if we create real space for them in the education system. I believe we have to do this by reducing an excessive focus on examinations early in life. 
However, we cannot rush changes in education. We have to build on the reforms of the last decade, and proceed in careful steps.  

We have made important changes in curriculum in Primary One and Primary Two, and no examinations are allowed at those levels.  I notice though that some schools have packaged examinations differently now. They have split it up into different end-year tests and the parents are still very eager to see the results of the tests. It takes time to change some things! 

We have loosened  our streaming system -  replacing  primary school streaming with subject banding at Primary Five and Six, and making secondary school streaming more flexible. We have significantly modified the gifted education programme, including replacing it with a flexible system of talent development in secondary schools. We have introduced new pathways of progression from one level to another, through ‘DSA’ – direct school admission – which encourages students to focus on developing different talents, and not focus exclusively on the PSLE. 
These are important changes. Some of them can still be implemented better. But they have taken us in the right direction.  
However, we have to consider further refinements in my opinion. In particular, we have to consider how we should rank students through the PSLE, and how we decide on which student goes to which secondary school. 

We currently differentiate and rank students very finely at age 12 through the PSLE score system. A score of 142 is different from 140, and will matter for which school you qualify for.  It is much finer differentiation compared to what happens at the “O” and “N” Levels, and how students move on beyond secondary school.  At secondary 4, students are differentiated by grades which represent bands of scores, whereas at PSLE, they are differentiated by exact scores.

This is a very complex matter. It has to be studied very carefully, because if we do anything, it has to be done without shaking the confidence that parents have in our system of meritocracy. 

Whatever we do, we have to preserve the basic tenets of meritocracy and the fairness that it brings  -  so that anyone, regardless who your father and mother are, if you work hard, if you do well, you know that you will be recognised and given opportunities that help you go as far as you can.

We should not in my opinion change the weighting of individual subjects in the PSLE,  but we should consider how finely we rank students at the age of 12, and how students are posted to secondary schools on the basis of that ranking. 

We should also see how we can bring greater diversity into our schools including especially our top schools, because that too is an advantage in developing the character of our children. 

I believe that as long as we carry on with the present system of extraordinarily fine ranking through the PSLE score and consequently differentiation between different secondary schools,  it is inevitable that parents and teachers will place great emphasis on preparing their children for the PSLE, and it has to be at the expense of something else. 

We have to create real space for children to have a broad-based education, to interact outside the classroom, get to know each other across the races and social backgrounds, and to develop that zest for learning, for life, starting young. 

Something has to give -  we cannot keep everything else unchanged and try to add on more. So we have to find the right trade-off, and do it in a way that meets our real objectives in education.  We have to see how we can provide more space for developing character and encouraging children to think for themselves.

There is something about each of our festivals that we all enjoy and find meaningful as Singaporeans, from the time we were kids. Not everyone understands the full or deeper meaning of each festival or the special practices that mark the day. But we all know it is of deep significance to some of our fellow citizens. And that it is part of the rhythm of life that makes us Singaporean.    
 
The Malay name that we use for this holiday, Hari Raya Haji, comes from the fact that it occurs on the culmination of the Haj, or pilgrimage to Mecca. The Tamil Muslims say Haji Peru Nāl. The Arabic name refers to the act of sacrifice  -  Eid al-Adha, or Feast of the Sacrifice. 

Muslim volunteers perform the sacrificial slaughtering of sheep at our mosques after the congregational prayers in the morning. The sacrificial slaughtering, known as korban, is done in remembrance of the willingness of Ibrahim to follow Allah's (God’s) command to sacrifice his son (there is a similar biblical story of Abraham in the Christian Old Testament and account in  the Jewish Torah). The meat is distributed to relatives, neighbours and others,  with special attention to the needy, as a reminder to share one's wealth with others.

Have been at the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings in Tokyo. Singapore hosted in 2006. The Japanese have put great effort into this  - the first major international event they are hosting since the tsunami and nuclear accident in Fukushima last year, and happening while reconstruction is underway in the disaster-stricken areas. The Meetings are a huge undertaking, with over 11,000 participants. The last time Japan hosted the Meetings was a very important year for them -  1964. The Japanese regard 1964 as the year they rejoined the international family of nations. They hosted the Olympics, the IMF/World Bank meetings and launched the first Shinkansen bullet train that year - the world’s fastest train then.  The Japanese who were born during the period were referred to as “shinjinrui” (new people), because they grew up in a time of plenty.

The IMFC is the policy forum of the IMF, comprising 24 Ministers and central bank governors. Key challenge is in rebuilding confidence in Europe, US and Japan.   

Europe has taken important steps forward in the last 3 months to secure the future of the Euro and find a path back to growth. They need time to build a new and stronger union. In the meantime there is no painless fix  - they need to cut government deficits to bring down debts but it will mean recessions or slow growth for some years. They have to find ways to cut the deficits without hurting employment too much, and hurting the poor. 

The rest of the world including Asia is facing the ripple effects of the problems in these advanced countries. Each of us in Asia have our own challenges too. But there is still a sense of optimism in this part of the world. One world, but two quite different moods."

496904023672427_503244806371682,"Does the journey create the person, or does the person create the journey? 

That’s the question at the start of a little book called ‘Past>Present>>Future’, that has just been published by five SMU students led by Clive Lim. I launched it this morning with SMU President Arnoud de Meyer and Mayor Sam Tan.  

The book brings together many personal stories written by young people -  about how they overcame challenges and created a sense of purpose in their lives.  The students collaborated with a few organisations  -  Central Singapore CDC, nEbO, Special Olympics Singapore and Youth Without Borders.   The proceeds from the book will go to Hougang Care Centre, which is dedicated to helping people with mental illnesses. 

I said a couple of things at the launch: 

One of the things I can’t help noticing is that many of those who have succeeded in their careers or contributed to society were not academic high-flyers when they were young. And not all those who were academically tops have done well later.  

But most who have succeeded seem to have had one thing in common. They chose to do something they enjoy, and gain fulfilment from helping others. Some of them have gone along an unconventional path. Some are in regular careers, but go about things with real passion. 
 
What this has taught me over the years is that regardless of where we start or the disadvantages we face along the way, there is a way to catch up and do well in life. Doing what we enjoy and doing something meaningful to help others are ultimately more important than succeeding. But success often has a way of coming along with it.

Met an inspiring group of students yesterday -  at the Mercy Relief event to mark World Humanitarian Day. It’s commemorated internationally to honour those who have lost their lives or put themselves at risk while doing disaster relief or other humanitarian work.

The students are in their third year at Singapore Polytechnic (SP).  They had just completed a “Diploma-Plus” Certificate programme in Humanitarian Affairs.  Mercy Relief and SP had put a lot of effort into developing the programme, bringing in experts from the field.

This was the first batch, 34 of them. They had done it in the evenings  -  three modules, 180 hours, over two years  -  on top of their day classes in their various diploma courses. Plus a few weeks overseas, working in disaster-stricken or impoverished communities. They visited those affected by Typhoon Ketsana in Central Luzon, Philippines, where they learnt to plant mangrove and prepare sand-bags; and did a study to understand the plight of urban slum dwellers in Tondo, Manila.

They were from different fields in SP  -  business, engineering, tourism studies and so on  - but had all chosen to add on this new programme in humanitarian work. Why? Some told me it was because they “felt privileged” in Singapore. They spoke from the heart. Some others were interested in switching into careers in social work, and wanted the exposure. 

I’ve given out many academic scrolls, but this group had something extra as they bounced onto the stage. They had idealism. They were doing something out of interest, not because it was required of them. More like them are coming up now, in a new generation.  A real plus for Singapore.

A BRIDGE BETWEEN POLICY-MAKERS AND PEOPLE

Newly appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Transport, Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, says that his new position will give him more opportunities to contribute to policy-making. 

ASSOCIATE Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, 44, recently made the transition from the backbench when he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Transport. The Nee Soon GRC MP talks about his new post and excellence in the Malay community.


Question: What are your hopes in your new role?

What I hope is to be a bridge between policy-makers and the people.

As an MP, I've always been close to the ground. I have 16 coffee shops in my area and I spend every Sunday at one of the coffee shops. Coupled with other visits and spending a lot of time with my stakeholders, I can bring whatever I feel on the ground to the policy-making platform.

When my appointment was announced, somebody said: ""Oh, now you have to toe the line. You cannot state your views fully.""

But I think it is the reverse. This new platform allows me to engage better and be a part of the whole process.

I will also continue to engage my residents, which I have been doing since I became an MP. It will not be the case that they see less of me or I listen less because I have become an office holder.

Question: How has the Malay community responded to your appointment to political office?

Many in the Malay community welcomed the news of my appointment and have been very encouraging. What is important to me is that we should portray the image to Singaporeans that we are one team, even though we are all different players.

To me, at the end of the day, we have work to do. It is to better the lives of Singaporeans, whether you are Malay or Chinese or others.

Can we expect more leaders to emerge from the Malay community in the coming years?

As our country progresses, and aspirations of Singaporeans to do well in education go along with it, you would expect more and more people to be qualified.

But I think, more importantly, we need to get more Singaporeans to be involved in the community, to dirty their hands. Only then will they realise that the whole process of community engagement is complex. It requires not only IQ, but also EQ, a lot of listening and a sense of realism.

I would like to encourage more young Singaporeans to come forward to be involved with any organisation, not only political organisations. It can be a voluntary welfare or other organisation.

And I believe that you need to cast your net wide, so that we get the best people and form a diverse team.

I had no clear intention myself of becoming a community leader, but I was given the opportunity to be involved. Our leaders should continue to invite or give opportunities for people to be involved in this kind of work. At the same time, the youngsters must open their hearts to go into this process.


Question: What do you think of the awarding of the President's Scholarship to the first Malay student in 44 years?

I feel not only the Malay community should be happy, but Singaporeans should also celebrate this.

This is the success of our system - where you can see people from all walks of life having social mobility. The whole idea is to see how we can facilitate this process for more Singaporeans, to let them believe in this system.

I hope this will encourage and motivate more Singaporeans, not necessarily Malays only, to see that Singapore really is a city of possibilities - to think whether I want to excel in my education, my profession, the arts or so on, there are opportunities.

You must believe in yourself, and you must believe that the system will help you to move along the line.


Question: What do you say to those who think this honour has been too long in coming for the Malay community?

Personally, I want someone to be there for what he has achieved, not because we are entitled to it. President's Scholarship winner Adil Hakeem deserves it; it's something he has achieved.

The onus is on us, the community, to work together to motivate one another, to provide opportunities for one another to excel.

I wouldn't want a situation where everyone only looks up to a President's Scholarship winner. I want a situation where everyone has his own peaks of excellence and is able to achieve them.

While there can only be a certain number of such winners, the rest should also celebrate their own achievements.


Question: Are more measures needed to help young Malays excel in education?

I'm very optimistic that there will be more scholarship winners to come. They may not all win President's Scholarships, but we've seen more and more at other levels.

We need to continue to give the right motivation and support, to the lower stratum in particular, so that they can aspire and excel to their potential.

Honestly I'm very encouraged by my engagement with young Singaporeans, including those from the Malay community.

They want to do it on their own, in the sense that they are quite hesitant to go via affirmative action. They believe they can be part of the whole engine of contributing to the growth of Singapore.

Paid last respects to Christopher Neo this morning, before the last rites. He left us early, at 49. 

He led the NSP team in Jurong GRC in GE2011, and fought admirably.  I regarded him well  -  he had an unassuming style, and was concerned for poorer citizens. 
  
His wife Amy told me about the four wonderful kids he had left her with. They always helped each other. The eldest, doing her O-levels soon, helped the second girl; the second helped the third girl; the third played with the little boy aged 4. The girls were doing well in school.

His parents were elderly but sturdy. They were Chinese-educated, but spoke with me in English. Christopher left many siblings. His elder sister had been with him from his first GE in 1997 as his Election Agent, and we chatted about meeting at last year’s GE in Jurong.  Christopher had taken after his father, who contested in the 1963 General Elections with the Singapore Alliance party, more than three decades earlier. Christopher contested in four GEs. He had stamina.   

Every river, whichever its path, winds its way safe to sea. 
Rest in peace, Christopher Neo."
