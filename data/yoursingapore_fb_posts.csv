Zika is a mild disease, and the majority of people infected with Zika do not show symptoms. All reported cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection have recovered or are recovering. 

Singapore has put in place a robust system to mitigate the spread of Zika in the community.  The WHO upholds Singapore's transparency, regime of quick reporting and thorough response in managing the local transmission of Zika as a ""role model"" for other countries.  

The Singapore Tourism Board is working closely with in-market and Singapore travel trade partners to ensure that mitigating measures and communications are in place to allay potential visitor concerns. 

Visitors can refer to the National Environment Agency‚Äôs webpage on Zika (www.nea.gov.sg/zika) for the latest updates. Visitors who are pregnant are advised to adopt precautions to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes."
