30332546206_10153836165501207,"Pleased to welcome Commonwealth Secretary-General The Rt Hon Patricia Scotland QC, on her first official visit to Singapore. The 52 member states of the Commonwealth are geographically diverse but mostly share a common constitutional, legal and linguistic heritage. The majority of member states are also small states like Singapore.

Six months into her term as Secretary-General, Patricia had many ideas on ways to address issues of concern to Commonwealth member states, such as climate change, good governance, gender equality and youth empowerment. We will continue to work with the Commonwealth to share Singapore’s experiences with other small and developing Commonwealth member states, in particular exchanging ideas on how small states can work towards sustainable development in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals."

30332546206_10153829536206207,"Farewell to Dr Kwa Soon Bee, who was the key implementor of much of our post-independence healthcare system.

I was privileged to have served under him, and recall his dedication to bringing out the best in those around him. He always provided wise counsel, clear guidance and strong leadership. He paid attention to the career development of junior staff. I was amazed that he made time even for junior doctors like me. I will always treasure the tea sessions he hosted. He was my mentor and inspiration. 

Thank you so much Dr Kwa. We will never be able to repay you. But we may follow your footsteps in paying it forward to the next generation."

Pak Luhut used to be Ambassador to Singapore and has been a strong advocate for Singapore-Indonesia relations. We had a good discussion on stronger economic cooperation, especially in tourism and connectivity, between our two countries."

30332546206_10153821979821207,"Ho Chi Minh City is a vibrant commercial hub, and will be one of the megacities of ASEAN. 

Met HCMC People's Committee Chairman Nguyen Thanh Phong, who also hosted me to lunch. We discussed the common challenges that Singapore and HCMC face, such as environmental sustainability, water and public transportation. We both aspire to be Smart Cities, to address our peoples' needs in the face of the ongoing Fourth Industrial Revolution. Singapore is the top foreign investor in HCMC. I believe our investments will continue to flourish with support from the city government. 

Took a short tour of SC VivoCity in HCMC's District 7 with CEO of Mapletree Vietnam Mr Lee Seng Chee. Happy to see Singapore investments thriving alongside Vietnamese businesses. Had coffee at an organic produce store, 5th Element, owned by a Singaporean, Mr KC Low who has been in Vietnam for 30 years. Also explored Co.opXtra, a hypermarket run by NTUC Fairprice.

It was a fruitful introductory visit and I look forward to working with my Vietnamese counterparts to advance the Strategic Partnership between our countries.

We discussed ways to enhance cooperation in areas such as aviation, financial services, education and cybersecurity. Also exchanged views on regional developments, and reaffirmed the importance of ASEAN solidarity and centrality. Also happy to renew an Agreement with DPM Minh to promote interactions between our senior officials.

I also met President of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Nguyen Thien Nhan. The VFF plays a similar role as our People's Association.  We discussed ways to leverage on technology to engage our peoples, in particular our youth, and how to promote even stronger people-to-people interactions between our countries.

Found time to stop by the Vietnam Military History Museum. I learnt more about the crucial events in Vietnam's struggle for independence that reflect the Vietnamese' powerful sense of national identity, determination, discipline, self-sacrifice and purpose. It was a sobering reminder that we should not take for granted the peace and sovereignty that our countries enjoy today.

Had a good meeting with Chairman of the Communist Party of Vietnam Commission for External Relations Hoang Binh Quan. We discussed developments in the region and some of the common challenges faced by Singapore and Vietnam, such as developing our human resources and engaging our youth.

Also glad to meet the Singaporean community here at a reception organised by our Embassy in Hanoi. Many of them have lived and worked in Vietnam for several years; quite a number for decades! I was happy to hear their stories, and heartened to learn that many, like Michael Ong through his ""Tea Talk Vietnam"" social enterprise for youths, have gone out of their way to make a difference to the local communities in Vietnam. 

Many of the Singaporeans also told me that they have benefitted from the brand name of Singapore. We are fortunate that it comes with a reputation for integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness. We must all do our best to keep the flag flying high, both in Singapore and abroad.

Looking forward to exploring new areas of cooperation with Vietnam in my meetings today.

30332546206_10153812670546207,"Had a wonderful evening celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Singapore-Japan relations (SJ50) at the SJ50 Gala Night organised by Ad Planet Group.

This charity event featured performances by Japanese calligrapher Shoko Kanazawa, who has Down Syndrome, and Singaporean pianist Azariah Tan, who has degenerative hearing loss. These two talented and accomplished young people did not let their disabilities deter them in the pursuit of their passion. While we often think of special needs individuals in terms of what we have to do for them, Shoko’s inspiring calligraphies and Azariah’s beautiful music have shown that it is us whose lives have been richly blessed by them. “Perception”, the photomontage of the special needs community by Singaporean photographer ND Chow was an apt reminder that humanity, in all our diversity, is beautiful and precious. 

I am heartened to see Singapore and Japan collaborating - including at the people-to-people, and business-to-business level - on such meaningful causes. I am confident that our ties will grow stronger as we look towards SJ100 and beyond.

Thank you to our Cashew Zone 2 RC volunteers for supporting this house visit, and for your hard work over the years to build a better home in #HollandBukitTimah for all our families."
30332546206_10153807266056207,"Delighted that our beautiful Bukit Timah Nature Reserve has re-opened. It is a wonderful place with so many unique memories for all of us. 

Amazingly, there is greater biodiversity in Singapore than in continental North America. 

Spend some time with your family here. NParks has done an excellent job of restoring the trails and protecting our precious natural heritage."
30332546206_10153806553686207,"Cities are now the centres of gravity in the world. As more people begin moving to cities, what people do in cities will very quickly become the dominant theme for the world.

Cities need to build bridges, not walls. Even as Singapore has a massive network of submarine fibre optic cables converging here and connecting us to the world, it is even more important to adopt a state of mind that is open to collaboration, new ideas, products and services.

This enables greater exchanges, partnerships and value creation to be derived from emerging platform technologies such as artificial intelligence, 3D printing, big data and the Internet-of-Things.

I am glad to speak at the CNN/ CapitaLand Future Cities Asia Forum and witness a new partnership between CapitaLand and Grab who are harnessing technology and collaborating to develop a new service for consumers.

We have embarked on our #SmartNation journey not just because we can, and because we have to. What used to be existential vulnerabilities - such as being small and compact - may actually be an advantage for Singapore to be a place where the brightest minds converge, collaborate and innovate smart solutions that can be test-bedded, up-scaled here before being commercialised for other global cities too!"
30332546206_10153804809086207,"Had another fruitful meeting with President of the Eurasia Group, Ian Bremmer. Last saw Ian in New York in April. Always enjoy listening to his insights on what's going on around the world. We discussed ongoing developments in the region and the US, and how Singapore and other Global Cities can best seize the opportunities available.

Was also pleased to separately meet a bipartisan delegation of staffers who assist various US Senators and Representatives. They are visiting to learn more about Singapore and our policies. We had a good discussion on foreign policy, the excellent ties between Singapore and the US, and the importance of the US' continued engagement of our region. I believe the delegation had an enriching and enjoyable trip to Singapore and hope they will visit again, with their bosses in tow!"
30332546206_10153801889686207,"Enjoyed my discussion with President of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Ambassador Ivo Daalder, who is on a study trip to Singapore under the Chicago Council’s Global Cities Project. We discussed developments in the region, and the importance of the TPP, not just for the economic benefits it will bring to the US and the rest of the Asia-Pacific, but also as a signal of the US’ commitment to continue its longstanding engagement of the region.

I also enjoyed our discussion on how Chicago and Singapore can cooperate in areas such as advanced manufacturing, technological innovation, and smart cities. One key similarity between Chicago and Singapore; we are both urban centres doing our best to get onto (and stay on!) the leading edge of the technological revolution that is transforming our societies, in order to provide the jobs of the future, and a better life for our people. To achieve this, strong global partnerships and the sharing of ideas are essential."
30332546206_10153796385536207,"Two segments of the Berlin Wall were unveiled at the NUS UTown Sculpture Garden this evening. The segments are a gift from German company Lagerhaus to mark 50 years of diplomatic relations between Singapore and Germany, which we celebrated last year. 

The Wall segments are a physical reminder of a turning point in history. For nearly half a century, the world was divided. The fall of the Wall on 9 November 1989 marked the rejection of isolationism in favour of interdependence, and barriers in favour of bridges. 26 years on, these ideals still hold true, as we seek to build a world characterised by peace, cooperation, and win-win outcomes.

30332546206_10153793322546207,"Had a lively discussion with students from the NUS College of Alice & Peter Tan - CAPT. We touched on a wide range of pertinent issues facing our society today such as inequality, disruption and future jobs. 
 
I shared my hypothesis that many of these disruptions are not, in fact, the result of a right-wing political conspiracy - but are brought about by the rapid advances in technology, connectivity and scientific breakthroughs taking place globally. 
 
Yet, these disruptions represent huge opportunities for us to build a #SmartNation, and education remains of key importance in preparing our people with the right skills and knowledge; forming a strong foundation for human creativity, innovation and collaboration to flourish.
 
In this new age, each of us are more empowered and can play a role to address our societal needs in a completely transformed way, and I believe Singapore has what it takes to be in the game. If we can get it right, we get to buy ourselves another chapter of global relevance!"
30332546206_10153783816266207,"Rounded off a hectic week away from home with the ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok (directly from Australia). 

Europe and Southeast Asia are both undergoing profound challenges. Global growth and trade have slowed. 

Digital technology has displaced jobs - and both younger and older workers need new skills. 

Conflicts continue to fester in the Middle East, and generate more violent extremism in other regions including ours. 

Globalisation is facing a crisis of confidence. 

We discussed the need to accelerate growth by investing in education and infrastructure, promoting free, fair trade and greater connectivity. 

We made the case for an ambitious ASEAN-EU FTA and a more liberalised air transport regime. 

An interdependent world characterised by better integration and win-win cooperation is the way to create a brighter future for our people. 

On the other hand, the creation of isolated, rival blocs is a recipe for stagnation and conflict. 

I also signed the condolence book for His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej at the Thai MFA, and met several of my European counterparts. 

Back home for a week, before heading to Vietnam for my introductory visit.

Singapore and Australia are convergent strategically and complementary economically. 

Australia can become the hinterland Singapore lacks. This will exponentially increase space and opportunities for all Singaporeans. And we will help plug Australians directly into Asia. A win-win outcome. 

There is added poignancy for me at a personal level. I made two trips within two weeks to Australia to finalize negotiations for the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in March this year. Those two weeks were the final two weeks of my late father's life. Time away that I can never reclaim. But my father would have understood why this is so important for the future generations of Singaporeans.

USG Kim delivered UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks at the opening ceremony of the inaugural Singapore International Cyber Week. The UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), which USG Kim oversees, plays a key role in facilitating inclusive and comprehensive cybersecurity discussions at the UN, including the development of new norms.

We reaffirmed our commitment to strengthen our promising bilateral account, thru initiatives such as our Turkey-Singapore FTA which we hope to have ratified and implemented soon. We also discussed a range of issues such as civil aviation, security and cultural cooperation. We had a frank exchange of views on regional developments. 

Also visited Antalya today, to visit NParks' exhibition, titled ""City in a Garden"", at the EXPO 2016 - a display of gardening cultures from around the world. The EXPO was a wonderful platform for us to share some of our ideas and experiences in balancing the conservation of our rich biodiversity with urban development. Well done to the NParks team! I was also glad to have a chance to visit some of the other exhibits at the EXPO. 

To round off my visit, I met Antalya Mayor Menderes Türel and was hosted to dinner by Governor Münir Karaloğlu. We had interesting discussions on developments in Antalya. 

This has been a good visit. I hope to welcome FM Çavuşoğlu to Singapore soon and reciprocate his generous hospitality!"

I later visited Turkey's Grand National Assembly which was the target of a bomb attack during the recent July 2016 coup. That the coup was foiled is just the most recent example of the grit and resilience of the Turks.

Also met PM Binali Yıldırım, and Acting Speaker Mehmet Akif Hamzaçebi. We took stock of our warm and substantive bilateral relations and discussed how to further expand cooperation."

Delighted to see so many residents of all ages at the official opening of our #Cashew Zone 2 RC community garden near Blk 180A Lompang Road. 

There is something special about gardening, it's a practical way of learning many of the important lessons of life.  

Amidst the fast-paced nature of life in the city, it reminds us that we need to have patience.  It reminds us that there is no short cut to success; what we reap is what we sow.  Most of all, it reminds us that how something turns out, whether it's a plant, a marriage, or our children, reflect the amount of love and care we invest into it.

It is not often in the lives of politicians and diplomats that we get to be present at the genesis of a major earth-changing moment.

30332546206_10153679352446207,"A central political challenge of our time, especially for countries in the Indian Ocean - the choice between an interdependent world characterised by mutual cooperation, an inclusive regional architecture and win-win outcomes; versus narrow, exclusivist, independent blocs defined by rivalry, might and zero sum games. 

For thousands of years, the Indian Ocean was a conduit for successive waves of language, religion and culture that transformed all our countries. Even today, we see the legacy of Sanskrit, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, eastern art and culture in all its splendid diversity. It is remarkable that all these exchanges came across the seas, but there were generally no major large scale naval conflicts.

However in the two centuries after the Industrial Revolution, Western countries used the Indian Ocean to project their naval power and expand colonial rule in Asia. Almost all of us were colonized, and this yoke has only been lifted since the end of the Second World War. 

We have seen tremendous progress since then. Today, 80 per cent of all seaborne trade flows through the Indian Ocean. It is an essential conduit that all of us depend on. How we handle the challenges of the Indian Ocean and resolve our differences will also have a profound impact on our future. 

We have to secure the peace, integrate our economies, promote investments, prepare our people for future jobs in the ongoing digital revolution. 

This is all the more crucial as Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia have a large demographic dividend to harvest over the next 30 years. We have large talented, young populations that aspire to, demand and deserve a better future. We should work together to build an inclusive regional architecture that can deliver peace, stability and prosperity for all.

Gangsa Road (Blks 154, 163 and 165)/ Petir Road (Blk 168)/Maysprings Condo/The Linear is currently an active dengue cluster (red alert level) with 16 cases since the start of the cluster. 

Besides handing out flyers to our residents, we also worked with the agency representatives to look out for potential breeding sites for mosquitoes, including the Aedes mosquito, which is responsible for the transmission of both dengue and the #Zika virus. 

The key strategy in the fight against dengue and Zika is source reduction: tackling the root of the problem by denying the Aedes mosquito a place to breed. Everyone must play their part.  

Do keep a look out for potential breeding spots at home (e.g. indoor domestic containers and discarded receptacles) and in the common areas (e.g. drains). If you sense anything wrong, please immediately alert NEA.  Do also protect yourself and your family by applying mosquito repellant, which can help to reduce the chances of being bitten by mosquitoes.

30332546206_10153654969401207,"Joined MFA staff to pay tribute to Mr SR Nathan who played a key role in the fledgling ministry during his two stints, first from 1966-1971, and then again as First Permanent Secretary from 1979-1982.

When they first started out, Mr Nathan and the other MFA pioneers had no files, no SOPs, no training, no institutional memory to call on. They only had their guts, their instinct, their intellect, and their total devotion and commitment to Singapore. They charted a path for our young nation, consolidated our sovereignty, built our international networks, and supported our economic development. Many of the Ministry’s institutional practices which we still retain till today were due to his ideas. He encouraged clear and succinct writing, and inculcated critical thinking. His foresight and efforts have paid off. That we can, today, credibly represent Singapore as an independent, sovereign, successful and cohesive nation-state, is due to the tremendous efforts of the pioneer generation of MFA officers. We stand on the shoulders of giants; Mr Nathan was one such towering giant.

He played a leading role in many defining chapters of our foreign policy. He successfully defended our sovereignty and promoted our interests with that special blend of “charm and toughness”, to quote Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Mr Nathan handled all challenges with quiet and effective diplomacy, defused tensions whenever possible, maintained open channels of communication, and firmly defended our interests.

Even after being elected President in 1999, he maintained a unique relationship with our Foreign Service, imbuing his presidency with a very strong foreign policy orientation. As Mr George Yeo said, “President Nathan never really left the diplomatic service.” During his 12 years as President, he raised Singapore’s international profile. He made about 30 State and Official Visits. He maintained the close relationship not just at an institutional level, but also made time for regular fireside chats with young Foreign Service Officers.

Mr Nathan said in his memoirs that “duty to friends and family, to my fellow men, to country is paramount to my view of life and I have tried my best to live up to this ethic”. His illustrious career exemplifies an unwavering sense of duty to Singapore and to Singaporeans. Mr Nathan served Singapore faithfully, defending and promoting our interests with utmost distinction and equanimity.

Thank you Mr Nathan. Thank you for a life well-lived, for your devotion, for being a wonderful man and a pillar of support for all of us. Thank you."

I will always remember my father describing Mr SR Nathan in reverential tones. 

He was first and foremost their old childhood friend from a humble background who made good. But he never forgot his roots or his old friends. He always made time for them despite the huge demands on his time. 

I recall consulting him before I entered politics in 2001. We discussed the fundamental basis of Singapore's multi-racial and multi-religious society, and how important it was to protect this hard won harmony. Apart from his own contributions to the Hindu community, he was a passionate advocate for the Inter-Religious Organization. I was inspired to witness his special  friendship with leaders of other religious faiths and how effectively they worked together. 

More importantly, his life was a paragon  of devotion to the national cause and care for the most vulnerable members of our community. He started the President's Challenge to mobilize all Singaporeans to express our care on practical ways, large and small. He always reminded me during my years in MCYS that he started his own professional career as a social worker. 

Over the years I consulted him on many occasions. He was alway generous with his advice - based on his values and experience. He focused on practical and long term solutions to social challenges. 

He was also our Permanent Secretary in MFA and later on our Ambassador to the United States at pivotal points in our national history.  We will never forget his bravery, devotion, gumption, grit and energy in standing up for Singapore and Singaporeans. 

We will always owe him and his pioneer generation a great debt that we must pay forward for future generations."

And the incident last night when PM Lee had a vasovagal episode emphasised this in a most pointed and poignant way.

My initial thought was ""Oh no, not again"".
And I am so glad it wasn't. 

When we rushed up on stage, we found PM Lee fully conscious but having classic symptoms and signs - sweatiness, low heart rate and low blood pressure. The initial light headedness resolved within minutes, and I knew he just wanted to get back on stage to complete his speech. Whilst the initial tests were being done, he was busy re-editing his speech! 

And then he went back on and completed his speech. His words took on added significance.

We then went to SGH for more tests - which were all normal before calling it a night around 1:30 AM.

Let us all count our blessings, and continue to do our best. There is still so much more to be done. Hope PM got a good night’s rest. He deserves it!

30332546206_10153642265736207,"Presenting the MFA Scholarships this morning was an opportunity to reflect on the deeper significance of scholarships in Singapore.

As someone who has served almost twelve years of bond, I had three personal messages for our scholars. 

One, a scholarship is a commitment to serve our nation and our people. It is not a transaction. We expect all of you to honour this, even if you have to compromise and give up some individual preferences along the way. You have to serve all the way. It is a matter of honour.

Two, use your time to expand your horizons. Your university days are going to be some of the best years in your life so experience as many things as possible. Make new friends, especially people who are different from you; everyone has an interesting life story to share. 

Three, MFA only exists because Singapore is an independent sovereign state. Therefore, it is every Foreign Service Officer’s sacred and paramount mission to preserve, protect and nurture Singapore's independence and sovereignty. You should never forget this. That is why we have one of the best diplomatic services in the world. Every single Foreign Service Officer has to work harder, smarter and be more constructive in order to ensure that we remain relevant and are heard despite our tiny size.

My heartiest congratulations to Gwyneth, Kean, Roystan, Yi Jun, Valerie, Wei Liang and Wei Jin, and to your parents! You have made your parents proud, and I am sure that you will also make Singapore proud and fly our flag high wherever you are."

Germany is our top trading partner in the EU and there are more than 1,500 German companies in Singapore. Singapore continues to learn from Germany in areas such as vocational training.

I also enjoyed listening to what drives them as young politicians. We have much in common with Germany. I could not agree more when the parliamentarians said that sustainability is foremost in their minds when they look at economic, social and environmental policies. Interestingly, the delegation shared with me that the word – sustainability – originated in Germany some three hundred years ago. I am pleased that the parliamentarians were very supportive of the EU-Singapore FTA. We agree that it is crucial for countries and their populations to support further trade liberalisation in an interdependent world.

The digital revolution has similarly transformed the financial sector. #Fintech has impacted the way we transact! Not only are financial services now available on-the-go on mobile phones, Artificial Intelligence-based machines may soon be able to dispense investment advice and customise experiences to clients. What this means, is that there are boundless opportunities to innovate and harness technology to improve the way we interact and transact with one another.
 
To facilitate this, we have and will continue to build and upgrade our infrastructure, equip our people with the skills required for the future, be a conducive laboratory for testbedding ideas, and continue to invest in R&D. Hence, for #Singapore to be a Smart Financial Centre, we have also launched the Fintech Office as a one-stop virtual entity for all Fintech matters, announced the Financial Sector Technology and Innovation (FSTI) scheme to support projects and initiatives, and a proposed regulatory sandbox for Fintech experiments. In short, we’re ‘open for “smart” business’!
 
What we need to succeed then, is a culture with the right blend of openness, cooperativeness, and innovation. And this was what I saw yesterday at Paypal’s Fintech Xchange – the coming together of companies, start-ups and IHLs to explore disruptive technologies and co-create solutions in the areas of Financial Services, Payments and Information Security.

30332546206_10153622684166207,"Pleased to join the children, parents and teachers of our #Cashew PCF Childcare and Kindergarten for their #NationalDay Observance Ceremony this morning. 

Looking at the bright eyes and happy smiles of the children, I was reminded that the hard work of building Singapore never ceases. 

What we do today is so that they will inherit a better Singapore, on which they can build their future and achieve their dreams. 

Similarly, it will be up to them to build an even better Singapore for their children and grandchildren, through #SG100 and beyond.

Happy to welcome this year’s participants to Singapore. We had a good discussion on the deep, long-standing and multi-faceted ties between our countries and peoples, and how we can further strengthen relations, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of our bilateral relations (SJ50) this year."

The small and medium businesses started by our immigrant ancestors played a crucial role in our commercial success over the years. They still provide the bulk of our jobs. Globalization and the technological revolution will change the way we do business. But the underlying values of hard work, thrift, loyalty and pride of ownership will always remain relevant. 

Also remarkable has been the SCCCI's commitment to multi-racialism and a fair society, with a place for everyone regardless of race, language or religion. The way the majority has protected the minorities has been key to our unity as a nation."
30332546206_10153616037306207,"Delighted to join our residents for our #Cashew constituency #NationalDay Carnival at Senja-Cashew CC on Sunday.  There was something for everyone including carnival games, a movie screening of Long Long Time Ago (Parts 1 and 2) and a spectacular Getai performance. 

Liu Ling Ling, as usual, did an amazing job as emcee for the Getai, delivering many witty punch lines which had our residents laughing non-stop.  The singing performances from the guest singers ranging from local Xinyao classics to popular Mandarin and English favourites from different generations also got many of our residents singing along.

The highlight of the Getai was undoubtedly the finale when everyone stood up to sing our very own Cashew National Day song “The Power of Solidarity” (团结的力量) and “Stand Up for Singapore”. 

As I walked around to mingle with our residents, I was touched to see the close family bonds and friendship among neighbours.  A timely reminder that what makes Singapore such a special home for each and every one of us are the people in our lives – our family, our friends and our community. 

Many thanks to all the Grassroots Organisations including the RCs/NCs and the various CC sub-committees for coming together to make the event such a memorable one for our residents! #HollandBukitTimah"

Was really heartened to see our residents singing the National Anthem and reciting the National Pledge with great pride.  We've come such a long way in the past 51 years because as a country, we believed that we could overcome the odds to build a successful Singapore.  Singaporeans from all backgrounds rallied behind this vision and worked hard to commit their lives to building a better Singapore.

To continue to remain successful in the next 50 years and beyond, we must continue to have this same spirit of belief, industry and commitment to Singapore. 

Pleased to also give out the long service awards to a number of our grassroots leaders.  Many thanks for your contributions to our #HollandBukitTimah community!"

I vividly recall that the first major decision I took when I assumed the MEWR portfolio in 2011 was to re-start the building of hawker centres. 

I strongly believe in the social value created by our hawker centres. They are a treasured heritage of our Singapore way of life. Besides providing a wide variety of local fare at affordable prices, they are an important social glue, bringing Singaporeans from all backgrounds together as we interact and bond while sharing in our favourite local hawker food. 

The hawker centre at Bangkit is the first of two hawker centres in Bukit Panjang with another one coming up in the northern part of our town in the Senja area. Our #HollandBukitTimah residents can look forward to even more food options in the years ahead!"

Everyone was in cheerful mood and it was especially nice to see so many young children and a number of three-generation families at the event.  Also heartened to see the close bonds of friendship that have been built up between neighbours over the years.  A timely reminder that despite the busy nature of life, it’s ultimately these bonds of family and friendship which provide nourishment for our inner being. 

As I walked around to mingle and chit-chat with our residents, I was delighted to see so many familiar faces whom I’ve had the privilege of knowing over the years.  Really happy to see them in good health and spirits and to see that their children (and grandchildren for some) are growing up well.       

Glad to hear from our residents that the recent developments in our estate, including the #Downtown Line and the redeveloped park along #Cashew Road, have improved their lives.

Really happy to see the strong #KampungSpirit among residents of different races.  Given the racial cohesion that we enjoy today in Singapore, one may assume that racial harmony comes naturally.  This is not so.  The reality is that we had to work hard, over many generations, to build up the mutual trust and understanding among the different ethnic communities.  All this can very quickly disappear if we are not careful and every Singaporean must continue to play his or her part to preserve this state of racial harmony and cohesion.       

The RC arranged for a number of familiar childhood games such as top spinning (gasing), five stones, pick-up sticks and ring toss.  I tried my hand at top spinning, but was not successful. 

Delighted though to see the kids (and adults!) having an enjoyable time playing the various games (with considerably more success than I did). :)

Chestnut Estate is nestled in a quiet and peaceful area off Upper Bukit Timah Road.  Many of the residents have lived here for 20 years or more.

Would like to make special mention of Mr and Mrs Chow who have four children, with their fifth on the way!  Congratulations to your family and thank you for being a shining beacon of family love, commitment and dedication.

Had a wonderful time joining our residents for their very colourful and fun Gema Raya celebrations organised by our Senja-Cashew CC Malay Activities Executive Committee (MAEC). Really enjoyed the nice performances prepared by our residents, especially the dance performances from the young children! 

It was heartening to see residents of different races joining in the celebrations.  The strong and cohesive society which we enjoy today in Singapore did not come by chance.  It is the result of strong mutual trust and understanding built up through successive generations.  We must continue to protect and preserve this treasured feature of our Singapore way of life.

The most challenging part of the negotiations was the formulation of the 2nd paragraph. It is an important statement of principle that is worth emphasizing. It goes to the heart of the challenge for small states like us. 

""We reaffirm our shared commitment to maintaining and promoting peace, security and stability in the region, as well as to the peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force, in accordance with the universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).""

We discussed how engineers often saved more lives than even doctors because the provision of safe water, hygienic sewerage and safe environments is essential for public health. 

We also reflected that the true cost of providing piped water is often hundreds of times cheaper than for bottled water.

30332546206_10153569684656207,"When I assumed the role of Grassroots Adviser for #Cashew Division a decade ago, the Cashew Road area looked completely different.  Today there is a #DowntownLine station where residents can board the MRT and reach the city in around half an hour, and two new flyovers which have helped to improve the flow of traffic along Upper Bukit Timah Road. 

With last Saturday’s official completion of the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) for Cashew, Hazel and Almond Estates, we now have a redeveloped park with new fitness corners and playgrounds; and wider footpaths, improved drainage and façade within our estate.  

As I stood with our residents at the park and looked at the surrounding developments, I couldn’t help but recall how far we’ve come over the past decade.  It was especially heart-warming to see families spending quality time together at the park: parents running and cycling with their children and grandparents playing with their grandchildren at the playground.

We could not have made all these improvements without the support of our grassroots volunteers, residents and the local agencies.  Our volunteers worked tirelessly over the years to reach out to our residents to gather support and feedback for these developments.  Our residents demonstrated great patience and understanding, bearing with the noise and inconveniences as the agencies carried out the multiple improvement works to build a better home for our families. 

In a way, it’s the same with the #SingaporeStory.  We’ve had to adapt and progress in order to remain relevant to the world around us and the times in which we live.  However, even as we’ve progressed, we’ve stayed true to these values of hard work; mutual understanding and trust within the community; and the willingness to work towards the longer-term interests of our family, community and country.  These values will continue to hold us in good stead as we work together towards #SG100 and beyond. 

It has been a privilege to serve our #HollandBukitTimah community.  Let’s continue to work hard together to build an even better home for our families.

Technology changes everything, and the city as we know today is a result of the previous industrial revolution. But there is a new digital revolution that will transform the way we organise our societies; plan our cities; and deliver services to our citizens in a #SmartNation. Key to this is the importance of “openness”.
 
Openness to experimentation
Open standards
Open source
Open data
Open societies
 
First, we must have an openness to experimentation. Today, there is no 'final solution’ but an ever evolving set of improving solutions; we need to adopt an iterative process. Secondly, open standards are needed to facilitate interoperability and synergy. People should interoperate and collaborate seamlessly; no one derives competitive advantage by erecting walls.
 
Next, an open source approach avoids black boxes. People are always able to work on improving existing solutions in a collaborative way and build a sharing economy.
 
Open data enables cities to leverage on big data to glean insights and create real value.
 
And finally, we need an “open society”, one characterised by high levels of trust, collaboration, and security, and equally important – the protection of privacy to the maximum extent possible while still providing open data and open collaborative platforms.
 
I’m also very pleased to see some of the latest smart solutions at the “Towards a Smart and Sustainable Singapore” Pavilion, where various government agencies are showcasing the way we harness data and technology to improve the way we live, work and play. Watch this space!"
30332546206_10153552774471207,"Enjoyed meeting some enthusiastic undergraduates from Singapore and the Asian region at the 2nd Asian Undergraduate summit. I shared how the various waves of industrial revolution have shaped the human history, and changed the way we live, work, learn and play. We are at the onset of yet another. This current digital revolution presents immense opportunities - to exploit and harness technology, to improve our lives. It is exciting times ahead and wonderful to be young and connected.
 
However, there are also challenges ahead that our brightest minds have to grapple with. How do societies navigate the initial inequalities and social angst that arise before the tools of technology become democratised and commoditised? How do we ensure that ethical and moral codes of conduct keep up with the rapid evolution of technology? How do we ensure that future generations continue to remain competitive and relevant. Better to be designers and masters of the new technology rather than the losing competitors of robots or artificial intelligence.
 
This is why Singapore has embarked on our #SmartNation programme. We want to ensure that our people and businesses will have the right skills, expertise and opportunities. We have to leverage on a global networks of ideas, people and resources in order to create, innovate and ultimately to make a positive difference to society.
 
Singapore maintains its great connection and links with many cities and I invited the bright young minds of today to collaborate, test and pilot solutions here that may address our current challenges, and be subsequently applied elsewhere too."

It teaches patience and careful watchfulness; it teaches industry and thrift; above all it teaches entire trust.” – a memorable quote from the British horticulturalist Gertrude Jekyll on the important lessons of life that one can learn from gardening.  
 
Community gardening has become one of the defining features of our #Cashew Zone 1 community, bringing together many residents who share a common love for plants.  The Herbal Garden which we launched eight years ago has been extremely well – utilised and has become a popular spot for residents to gather as they tend to their plants and share useful gardening tips with one another.   

To cater to the growing interest, our Zone 1 RC has worked closely with the Town Council to build a new community garden just behind Blk 144 Petir Road.  Privileged to join our residents for the official launch of the new garden last weekend.  Residents have already started to grow a variety of interesting plants in the new garden, such as zucchinis, bitter gourds, ladies finger and even winter melons!  

Also delighted to see residents having a very fun and educational time at the plant propagation workshop, picking up some useful tips from our trainer and good friend Uncle Tony.    

I would like to encourage our #HollandBukitTimah residents to try their hands at gardening at the various community gardens around our constituency.  You stand a chance to harvest not just the fruits of your labour, but more importantly, the rich lessons of life that nature has to offer.

During my house visit to Blk 137 Petir Road last Friday night, I caught up with many families whom I’ve known for a good number of years.  One of our residents, Mr Poh, showed me a photo of his daughter Agnes receiving an Edusave Award from me many years ago.  I could tell it was a number of years back as my hair colour was much darker then!  :)

I've had the privilege of witnessing many of our young residents grow up, from the time they were in primary and secondary school to where they are today.  Some are currently in tertiary education, while others have already started work and are helping to take care of their retired parents.  Really proud to see how far they've come over the years!    

Also delighted to meet a few families who have just moved into this block over the past year.  A warm welcome to our #HollandBukitTimah family and community.  I’m sure you’ll make many new friends here!"

30332546206_10153526417811207,"Residents who have met me during my regular house visits and community walkabouts in #HollandBukitTimah know that one of the questions I always ask married couples is ""Do you have children?""  If the answer is “yes”, I will also ask them how many children they have.      

You may wonder why children are so close to my heart.  For me, our children represent new possibilities, new hopes, rejuvenation, vitality, fearlessness and optimism. A society with many children is a forward – looking one that believes in the future and will invest in the future.   This is the real reason we encourage people to marry and have children.  It is not economics that is our primary concern.  It is the tone and outlook of our society that is of far greater importance.  

I had previously shared these thoughts in a speech to the Singapore Children’s Society almost ten years ago and I was reminded of it again last Sunday when looking at the bright eyes and adorable smiles of the many young children and babies participating in our #Cashew Baby Show and Kids Festival 2016.

Really happy to see the kids having such an enjoyable time participating in the various activities such as Balloon Sculpting, Mad Science Workshop and the Bricks4kidz Lego stations.

We are at an inflection point of both great opportunity and uncertainty. Previous phases of the industrial revolution were marked by great social and political disruptions, including greater inequality between those who understood new means of production vs those who could not keep up with competition. The difference now is the scale and pace of disruption due to globalisation and the digital revolution. Jobs are being disrupted on an unprecedented scale, including middle class white collar jobs. That is why there is so much anxiety and political angst all over the world.
 
Singapore and our ASEAN partners need to get ahead of the curve, seizing the opportunities, to be early adopters of the latest technologies and to ensure that our people get good jobs of the future. This is the prime imperative of our #SmartNation initiative. We need to prepare people through #SkillsFuture to find the jobs of the future, to improve quality of life and to develop a stronger sense of community amidst great diversity. We must be open to sharing new ideas and learning from each other. If we get it right, we will have a good chance for a brighter future, together."

Amidst the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, remember that our children too need our attention and our time, especially in the early years.  If we miss those crucial early years, then they will not need us so much anymore. And we would have shortchanged ourselves, more than them. 

Privileged to have had the opportunity to join my fellow Advisers Ms Sim Ann and Mr Liang Eng Hwa and our #HollandBukitTimah residents to participate in the Children's Festival organised by New Life Community Services.

The block parties organised by our Residents' Committees (RCs) provide a wonderful opportunity for neighbours to socialise and to know one another better; to progress from being neighbours to being friends. 

However, we don't need to wait for the next block party to know our neighbours better.  The next time you meet a neighbour in the lift, just take a moment to greet them and ask them how their day went.  It takes a certain amount of courage and stepping beyond your comfort zone, but it is worth the effort as you could potentially make a new friend.

She is a distinguished stateswoman well-respected for her insights on foreign policy.

30332546206_10153442939456207,"Celebrated 50 years of diplomatic relations between Myanmar and Singapore. Deeply honoured to meet Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. She is an inspiring figure who has sacrificed so much for her country and wields tremendous moral authority. She has many challenges during this delicate period of political transition. But there is great potential for national reconciliation and unity of purpose to place Myanmar on a positive trajectory that her people so richly deserve. 

Singapore's links with Myanmar go way back. Our shared British colonial heritage left us with some common cultural, architectural and institutional legacies. 

We also have strong economic ties. We are Myanmar's second largest investor and third largest trading partner. We hope to do even more together in areas such as tourism and air connectivity, trade and investments, healthcare, and education. 

Very impressed by the Singapore Myanmar Vocational Training Institute. Modeled on our own ITE, this institute helps train Myanmar youth with necessary skills for future jobs. The #SMVTI is sited on the grounds of the former Burma Polytechnic. Very heart-warming to hear from the students who now see a brighter future for themselves! Also very glad to hear that many of our first few batches of students have already found jobs.

I also had good meetings with the Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing; Education Minister Dr Myo Thein Gyi; USDP Chairman (former President) Thein Sein; and Chair of Union Parliament Commission for the Assessment of Legal Affairs and Special Affairs Shwe Mann. 

I am hopeful about Myanmar's future.  Singapore has been a reliable and steadfast friend to Myanmar for many decades. We will continue to help, wherever we can, in Myanmar's future development."

We are already one of the most well connected cities in the world, but imagine the possibilities of 100 million connected smart objects in Singapore. With every device, traffic light, lamp post, sensor and camera as nodes in the digital infrastructure, it will be fascinating to see what applications and actionable insights can be developed just from analysing the acquired data!

Indeed, the possibilities are endless and limited only by our imagination. In Singapore, we want to create a conducive environment so our people can take full advantage of the digital revolution to innovate new and potentially disruptive products and services.  

Creating trust through digital security is key as we communicate and transact online; stimulating research and development to develop new capabilities for Singapore is another important thrust; so is equipping our workforce with the necessary skills. And by ensuring that the right rules and regulations are in place to allow for experimentation, we not only encourage innovation but also the eventual adoption of new ideas.

I hope the energized crowd at the Smart Nation Innovations Week; the IHLs, start-ups, investors and corporations, will find that Singapore has no lack of opportunities -- that the real opportunities are available here for them to continue to experiment, innovate, collaborate and potentially, disrupt the world. So that in future, people will come to Singapore, and when they leave they will say that they have seen the future and it works!

30332546206_10153424666101207,"A vote of confidence in Singapore as the German European School Singapore (GESS) begins construction for a brand new enlarged campus. 

Historically, Singapore has been a vital node of the Maritime #SilkRoad that connected Asia to Europe. In 1965, Mr #LeeKuanYew made the decision for Singapore to welcome multinational companies to jumpstart our industrialisation process by bringing their technology, expertise and markets. This was globalisation before the word became fashionable. It gave us a major competitive advantage - and generated many jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans. 

That is why we must continue to be an open dynamic metropolis. We must also be seen as a safe, secure and great place to bring up families.  The expansion of GESS, which has grown from just six students 45 years ago to ultimately 2000 in the new campus is thus significant. 

I gave 2 suggestions to the GESS management. First, that they should be a paragon of sustainability given their great location at the edge of our Nature Reserve. 

Second, they should integrate into our local community by participating in our activities and by making their facilities open wherever possible. For example, a group of GESS students accompanied our local residents for a clean-up exercise along #Cashew Road yesterday. These activities will help them to integrate with the local community and provide them a greater sense of belonging to the area. 

Wish the GESS all the very best for this next phase of their journey in Singapore. #HollandBukitTimah"

Happy to also see a number of eager students from #BukitPanjang Primary School and the German European School Singapore (GESS) joining in. The clean - up effort was part of the nationwide Operation WE Clean Up! Movement initiated by the Public Hygiene Council. 

For those who remember how Singapore was like in the 1950s and 1960s, you would know that the environment we have today did not come naturally or by chance. It was because as a country we believed that we could have a #cleanandgreen environment if we set our hearts and minds towards a common goal.  And we did. 

It is thus a demonstration of our unity in purpose and our common love for Singapore, sustained through successive generations of Singaporeans. So the next time you see a piece of litter on the floor, do your part to pick it up, remembering that it's not just a piece of litter. The simple action is itself a demonstration of your love and commitment to Singapore. 

P.S. MSO has introduced a OneService app which you can use to submit feedback on cleanliness or any other municipal issue. No worries if you do not know which agency is in charge of the issue. Just snap a photo, tag and send the information through the OneService app.

30332546206_10153418122741207,"A historic day. We concluded a landmark agreement with Australia that sets our economic, defence and people-to-people ties on a completely new trajectory for the next generation. This agreement is built on a bedrock of shared history, close strategic alignment and economic complementarity. Building on our 2015 #Comprehensive_Strategic_Partnership (CSP), it is a win-win outcome that will expand opportunities greatly for Singaporeans and Australians. It will bring our people ever closer.  

Australia is a continent that is 10,000 times the size of Singapore. A sophisticated economy with many talented people, including an estimated 50,000 Singaporeans working and studying there. It has some of the best endowments of natural resources in the world and a vital agricultural sector. Singapore may be tiny, but we are a thriving metropolis in the heart of Asia; a key node with excellent port, airport and digital connectivity; a sophisticated manufacturing centre; a vibrant financial and business centre that is an interface to the ASEAN Economic Community, China, India, US & Europe. We have no natural resources. But most importantly, we have talented, disciplined, honest, reliable and hard-working people. The complementary strengths of Australia and Singapore will enable us to transform our respective economies for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, to collectively pursue global opportunities, and to promote peace and stability through fostering a strong network of friends and partners in the region.

There are four key elements:

First, we agreed to upgrade the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. These measures will increase the flow of trade and investment, reduce red tape and create new opportunities for investors,  businessmen and professionals in our two countries. We are already Australia’s fifth largest trading partner and foreign investor. I believe we can do far more.

Second, we have agreed to a major enhancement of defence cooperation. The SAF will be able to send far more troops for training in an even larger area (several times the size of Singapore) and to build state-of-the-art training facilities for at least the next 25 years. There will be expanded exchanges of civilian and military personnel and regular bilateral exercises. 

Third, we will jointly intensify our efforts to promote innovation and entrepreneurship, which presents exciting new opportunities for both our countries. Singapore and Australia can share knowledge and collaborate on smart cities, new technologies and creative industries. Australia will establish a “Landing Pad” in Singapore, which will act as a hub for Australian high-technology companies that are venturing overseas. This will facilitate a healthy exchange of ideas and synergy with our own start-up companies at our “LaunchPad”.

Fourth, we will strengthen our people-to-people ties by increasing youth exchanges, educational opportunities, cultural cooperation and tourism. There will be internship and Work-Holiday programmes that I know will be very popular with our students. Visa applications will be facilitated to make travel more seamless. The Australia-Singapore Arts Group will bring cultural leaders from both sides to enhance cooperation. This will give greater opportunities for Singapore artists, arts groups and cultural institutions to showcase their works in Australia.

It was a great privilege to work with Andrew Robb, Special Envoy of Trade of Australia, to coordinate and finalise this agreement. Minister Lim Hng Kiang and Minister Ng Eng Hen would also join me to thank Foreign Minister Julie Bishop; Defence Minister Marise Payne and Trade Minister Steven Ciobo for their strong support and leadership. A big round of thanks to our fantastic team of negotiators who spend countless hours away from their families to make all this possible."

Spent an enjoyable Saturday afternoon catching up with our Cashew Terrace residents at their street party. Glad that the initial heavy downpour did not dampen the mood of the party! 

Happy to hear that the #DowntownLine has made travelling much more convenient for our residents, with Cashew Station just a stone's throw away. Residents will also be able to benefit from an upcoming sheltered walkway along Cashew Road, allowing convenient access to the MRT station regardless of the weather. 

Beyond the hardware, it's the heartware - the close neighbourly bonds - that make Cashew Terrace such a wonderful place to live in.

Also met Environment Minister Tamayo Marukawa, Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Sadakazu Tanigaki, Komeito Chief Representative Natsuo Yamaguchi, and Democratic Party President Katsuya Okada, who shared their valuable insights on latest developments in Japan. Also met members of the Japan-Singapore Parliamentary Friendship League (JSPFL), including Chairman Kenji Kosaka and Minister for Economic Revitalisation Nobuteru Ishihara, and alumni of the Raffles Programme (RP), an annual programme which showcases Singapore to a select group of Japanese colleagues. The JSPFL and the RP alumni play a very important role in promoting Singapore-Japan relations, and I was glad to touch base with them.

Also attended a reception for the 11th Japan-Singapore Symposium (JSS), hosted by State Minister for Foreign Affairs Seiji Kihara, and delivered the keynote address at the open session of the 11th JSS on 26 April 2016, which marks the exact date of the 50th anniversary of Singapore-Japan relations. 

The excellent state of our bilateral relations today is the result of the vision of one man – Mr Lee Kuan Yew – who, 50 years ago, decided to turn the page and close the painful chapter of our wartime history. This paved the way for the Japanese to play a full and crucial role in our industrialisation. In turn, we have been one of the staunchest supporters of Japan's full integration into Asia. Our relationship, based on mutual trust and respect, has enabled us to be a pathfinder for Japan. For instance, we were the first country which Japan concluded an FTA with. Japan remains, till this day, our second largest source of investment, and a major source of tourism, with some 800,000 visitors from Japan in 2015 alone. We hope that other countries in Asia, through the exercise of political will and imagination, can find a way to join us in building a more prosperous, integrated, and secure region.

Hawker centres are a unique identifying mark of Singaporean society and an integral part of our social infrastructure.  It’s an important part of the local community because it’s a place where Singaporeans of all backgrounds can gather and share in our cherished Singaporean pastime – savouring our favourite local hawker delights.  

Hawker centres are also special because of the nostalgia, social bonding and friendships that emerge over years of interaction between hawkers and their regular customers.  Many of the hawkers have been at the same hawker centre for years, some for decades (as in the case of Ghim Moh).  They know us personally and remember our individual preferences.

First, treasure our time, especially time spent with our families and loved ones - because time passes so quickly and is irreversible.  

Second, treasure our families, especially our seniors. Much of what we have today is because of their unconditional love and sacrifice. 

Third, treasure the multi-racial and multi - religious fabric we have in Singapore.  Racial harmony is not a given and we had to work hard to get to where we are today. We must continue to do our utmost to preserve this.

That’s because future competitive advantage will be derived for the ability to gain insight from #bigdata in real time and to deliver new creative services.

We have the necessary infrastructure and ecosystem to support the latest and brightest ideas, to allow them to be incubated, prototyped, experimented, iterated and rolled out at scale. 

We will need our people to have the relevant skills in order to seize new opportunities as we collectively build a #SmartNation together.

Our #HollandBukitTimah residents can now visit #ChestnutNaturePark South, which was officially opened last weekend by SMS Desmond Lee.  

Located at the eastern end of Chestnut Avenue, Chestnut Nature Park serves as a green buffer for the Central Catchment Nature Reserve.  

As a shared community space for different users, visitors to Chestnut Nature Park South can look forward to a range of recreational activities such as hiking, mountain biking and bird watching.  Chestnut Nature Park is the first nature park in Singapore to have separate mountain biking and hiking trails.  

Nature enthusiasts can also keep a lookout for globally threatened birds such as the straw-headed Bulbul and the brown-chested jungle flycatcher which have been spotted there before.  

Thank you to the NParks team for working hard to make this happen.  Chestnut Nature Park North will be opening at the end of this year, so watch this space!

30332546206_10153363421691207,Highlights of my speech in Parliament during the 2016 Committee of Supply Debate on MFA
30332546206_10153363117861207,"Delivered my first Committee of Supply speech as Foreign Minister this afternoon. I made three key points.

One, Foreign Policy begins at home.  Singaporeans must have a realistic, coherent view of the world. We are a small state in a tough neighbourhood. We don’t have the natural advantages of bigger countries. So we need to make friends, and find ways to make ourselves useful so that others want to deal with us, or at the very least, are interested in our continued survival. If Singapore is irrelevant, or if we are not united, we will have no place in the world. And we must constantly adapt to changing geopolitical and economic conditions.

My second point is on how MFA, together with the rest of the government, helps to make lives better for you and your family. While the global economy is facing headwinds currently, there are bright spots. Our economic and other partnerships must expand apace. The ASEAN Economic Community is a market of 620 million people – more than 100 times Singapore’s population – with an estimated GDP of US$2.5 trillion. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement involving 12 countries, represents a market of 800 million people. We are also doing more bilaterally with other partners such as China, Japan, India, and Australia. As the front-line Ministry abroad, MFA supports Singapore’s economic agenda through diplomacy and advancing global trade. We will continue to work with other agencies to identify more opportunities to expand our economic space. 

Third, MFA will always be committed to providing responsive consular support for Singaporeans living or travelling overseas. Many people tell me that our overseas missions are the first thing that comes to mind if trouble arises while they are abroad. MFA officers are committed to doing their best to help fellow Singaporeans. We look forward to serving you even better by expanding the range and quality of our consular services.

30332546206_10153356705561207,"Today marks the 50th anniversary of Singapore’s diplomatic relations with the US. 

The US is a key partner for Singapore and we have been a steadfast supporter of the US’ presence in our region over the last 5 decades. We have robust cooperation on the political, security, trade and investment, and cultural fronts. We enhanced our bilateral Defence Cooperation Agreement last year. The US is our largest source of FDI and we are both part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We also have strong and growing people-to-people ties. More than 4,500 Singaporean students are now studying in the US. 

As we enter the next 50 years, Singapore looks forward to working closely with the US to further strengthen our ties.

We should work on expanding Singapore-Sabah ties. Tourism is one area where we can do more, given Sabah’s eco-tourism potential.

Malaysian FM Dato' Sri Anifah Aman also hosted me to lunch at the charming Gayana Eco Resort. Took the opportunity to visit the onsite Marine Ecology Research Centre. We have to be prepared for increasingly complex environmental challenges including more extreme weather patterns given the onset of climate change.

30332546206_10153333046121207,"We bade our final farewell to my dad today. My parents are now together again. 

We would like to thank all of you for the solace from your kind condolence messages. I am sorry that I haven't been able to respond individually.

I made this tribute in honour of my father's life. 

Tribute to my father Mr GD Balakrishnan 

My father was the most cheerful, caring and loyal man I have ever known. 

Everyone who has ever met my father will remember his smile and his infectious optimism. 

Everyone who sought help from him will remember his wise counsel and helping hands. 

If you ever found yourself in trouble, you could always count on my dad to loyally stand by you. 

""Lord, you have given me all that I could ever want, and more than I could ever ask for. ""

This was the prayer he made more than once - and most recently on New Year's Day 2016 when he held his great grandson for the first time. 

This is a prayer that only a faithful man who is truly happy and contented could make. 

He lived a full, happy and meaningful life. 

He was a teacher, a lawyer, a dedicated church leader and, most of all, a loving husband, a wonderful father, doting grandfather and great grandfather. 

He was born in pre-war Singapore on the 15th May 1930. His grandfather was a tailor who brought his father to Singapore a century ago. His father worked at the government printing office. 

He spent the war years in India, escaping on one of the last ships to leave Singapore before the Japanese invasion in 1942. 

On his return, he studied at St Joseph's Institution. He did reasonably well, but the family could not afford to put him through university. 

TEACHER

So he joined the Teachers Training College in 1950. He said, ""It was the best that we could do at the time"". 

He was initially posted to Griffiths Primary School. However the principal thought he was a  rabble rouser who was standing for elections for the Teachers Union. So he was transferred to Bukit Panjang Primary School where it was believed a strict principal could keep an eye on him. He was put in charge of the class with the most disciplinary problems. But he won the students over, and ended up being highly regarded by the principal. His students told me he was strict but never shouted at them.

Even to this day, when I walk around Bukit Panjang, people come to me, shake my hand warmly and tell me they remember my parents teaching them - and that they truly cared for their students. 

Of course, the best thing about Bukit Panjang Primary School is that there is where my parents met. 

My dad recounts how my mum would take a 'Pah Wang  Chia' (pirate taxi) from the junction of Jalan Besar Road and Rochor Road that would bring her all the way to Bukit Panjang. Today, you can take the Downtown Line MRT - much faster, but less romantic than a pirate taxi. 

He made sure he caught the same taxi at the same time each day. And later when he got a car, he offered to give a ride to my mum everyday. He also offered to tutor my mum in English Literature so that she could pass the qualifying examinations. But it wasn't long before my grandmother noticed that this Indian guy was spending way too much time with her Chinese daughter. 

In 1950s Singapore, inter-racial couples were unusual. And so my parents often told me they had to wait 7 long years before getting married in 1960. Just this morning, we found a Christmas card that he had sent my mum in 1954!

My father joined the inaugural part-time Law course at the University of Singapore in 1957. He graduated in 1963, but never practiced Law until he retired from the Civil Service in 1986. 

He loved education. Continued to teach, was promoted to Principal of Ama Keng Primary School, subsequently became an Inspector of Schools and Staff Officer at the Ministry of Education. 

He then became a lecturer at the Institute of Education - and I have now met many generations of teachers who recall fondly his impact on their teaching careers. 

LAWYER

He was one of the oldest 'pupils' in a law firm in 1986, and was called to the Bar in 1987. Law gave him a second career, and he ran his own legal practice well into his eighties. 

The field may have changed, but actually he was still doing what he did best all his life - giving help, providing timely appropriate advice and standing up for what is right. 

CHURCH

Church was a very big part of his life. 

He served so many years together with Rev Isaac Lim. He was the Chairman of the Wesley Local Church Executive Committee and Vice President of TRAC (Trinity Annual Conference).

There were three things he pushed for very hard, and sometimes somewhat forcefully.

He was always concerned for the welfare of the pastors. He fought for better terms of employment for pastors - believing that pastors deserved to be treated on par with teachers and principals.

He also believed in expanding the mission field for the church, especially through education. He served as the Chairman of the Methodist Church Education Board.

In 2003 the government offered Hwa Chong, SJI and ACS the option of starting an International School on condition that they raised significant funds upfront. 
There were doubts about the financial viability of this venture and a heated debate ensued. 
My father stood up and told the church leaders - ""As long as there is a cross on top of the building, we should proceed"". 
Today, when I witness the success and growth of ACS (International), I think of my father with pride. 

He was heavily involved in the Seniors Ministry of the Methodist Church. He was the founding chairman of the TRAC Board of Seniors Ministry. Today, many Methodist Churches have ‘GYM’ - the ‘Glowing Years Ministry’. This ministry provides seniors with fellowship, fulfilling activities and mutual support.
 

FAMILY

I was reminded of how deeply he loved my mother when my son, Mark, shared his last prayer with him last week. He was on a ventilatory mask, but called my son up close to pray with him. At the end of the prayer, he reminded my son to “cherish your wife all the days of your life”. And he did - all the days of his life.

I was a difficult child - a fussy reluctant eater, an obsessive perfectionist and overly attached to him. Frankly, I think I made the most demands on my parents time and attention as a young child. 

But dad was always super patient, always took the trouble to reason with us instead of simply putting his foot down.  

I recall regular trips with him to places like Magnolia snack bar and Komala Vilas - in search of food that I would like to eat.

He instilled in me the love of reading. He bought tons of books, especially when he spent two years in 1967 and 1974 studying in the UK. He subscribed to Readers Digest, Time and Newsweek magazine when I was in primary school.

He bought me my first computer - an Apple II plus. It cost him more than a month's salary but he took a loan. 

He coached me for debates. We had many fierce debates at the dining table. He believed in speaking up forcefully for the good and the right.

I consulted him on every single major decision of my life. He gave sound advice but always left me to make the final call. 

He was attentive to all his children. He was always there for us. My brother and sisters will all have their personal accounts of what he did for them. He appreciated that each of us was unique, and had to make our own way in life. He gave to each us according to our need. He was proud of us all. And he continued to care for each and every one of you. I recall so many private conversations where he would share his concerns for your families.

My parents prioritised family time. Dad would send and fetch all the children to and from school everyday. He specially ordered a car with a bench seat so that all seven of us could be in the same car - three in front, four at the back. For the first eighteen years, all family holidays were road trips to Malaysia, usually with my cousins in a convoy. We spent so much time together as a family. Values, norms, behaviour patterns, identity and memories were transmitted.

We had family meals together. Even after we all got married and moved, my mum and him made sure there was always a family lunch every Sunday. Chinese New Year Eve Reunion dinner was a compulsory fixture. My dad was not Chinese, but he insisted on maintaining this tradition even after my mum passed away.

My parents did not make demands. They inspired by example. 

Even today, everything I do for my own children is modelled on what my parents did for me. I know that I have fallen short of my father's wonderful standards of fatherhood. 

Both he and my mother were wonderful grandparents. They made it quite clear that it was the parents responsibility to discipline their own children, but the grandparents’ privilege to spoil the grandchildren. 

I still recall when we first had Natalie. We were still living with my parents. Natalie was almost as difficult a baby as I was. When she was fussing and inconsolable, we would come out of the room and find my parents waiting quietly outside the door - not interfering but making themselves available. 

He was so thrilled when Theo, his great-grandchild was born. Throughout his illness, his face always lit up whenever he saw him or watched videos and photos of him.

Mark reminded us the other night that Theo would never remember him the same way we do. But the way my dad lived his life defines the way we live our lives and our beliefs. The point is that we will be a living legacy of my father.

As the song goes - 
‘Let us leave to those behind us the heritage of faithfulness passed on through Godly lives
Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful
May the fire of our devotion light their way
May the footprints that we leave
Lead them to believe
And the lives we live inspire them to obey’

THANKSGIVING

My father was an old school gentleman in the fullest sense of the word. He was unfailingly polite. He did not offer empty courtesies, but sincere concern. Everyone who met him saw his smile and felt his heart. He paid no attention to race, language, religion or class. That is why he had so many diverse friends for life.
 
My family would like to thank you all for the many decades of love, friendship and support that you all gave my parents. You all know how deeply they treasured loyalty, sincerity and steadfastness in friendship. You all know who you are. The journeys in life you took together. The things you did for one another. The battles in life. The good times, the tough times. The love, the pain. All of you will have sacred memories.

The doctors and nurses who took great care of him all became far more. You were friends, almost sons and daughters. I saw the tender loving care you bestowed on him. And I knew that he had a personal relationship with each and every one of you.

My family can never thank you all enough. 

In this moment of sorrow, let us try to be happy.

My father repeatedly told me  “Life has been good. All is well”.

Bishop Solomon messaged me. 
""We praise God for him and take comfort he has found his eternal rest in the God he served."" 

Have a wonderful reunion with Mum. Wait for us.

We love you dad."

A successful Singapore.  What have I given up?  My life.” – Reminded of this moving quote from the late Mr #LeeKuanYew while joining in the official book launch of #TheSingaporeStory last Wednesday at the Arts House.  

The Singapore Story features a series of about 80 oil paintings from the private collection of Mr Vincent Chua, our #HollandBukitTimah resident.  The book is a culmination of many years of hard work by Vincent in collecting and commissioning artwork depicting the late Mr Lee and our founding generation, as well as the most important moments of our history.  In the words of PM Lee Hsien Loong, this is Vincent’s “labour of love” for Singapore.  

The book also serves as a powerful reminder to current and future generations of Singaporeans of the courage, ideals and values that Mr Lee and the founding generation stood for, as they wrote the first part of The Singapore Story.  It is important that we continue to uphold these values as we build on their legacy and write the next chapter of our Singapore Story.

I was also particularly pleased to see that CCF has tapped on the engineering expertise and knowhow of its directors and staff to address the key challenge of providing clean water when disaster strikes.

Delighted to catch up with Xiaoqi and her Mom during my house visit to Blk 606 Senja Road last Wednesday. 

I first met Xiaoqi almost ten years ago when she was about to embark on her medical degree course. She has now graduated and is starting her residency in obstetrics and gynecology. Really happy to see how far she has come over the years!

Singapore and Costa Rica are like-minded friends. As small countries, we seek to build global connectivity, and this is a key reason we signed the Singapore-Costa Rica Open Skies Agreement earlier today, as well as the Singapore-Costa Rica FTA in 2010. Our countries work together to advance the cause of small countries through mechanisms such as the Forum of Small States and the Global Governance Group.  (#FunFact: Did you know that Singapore and Costa Rica are both tropical countries with orchids as our national flowers?)

This is Minister González’s introductory visit to Singapore as Foreign Minister. We had a good and wide-ranging discussion on developments in both our regions, and other issues of common concern such as climate change. I look forward to working with Minister González to enhance existing links and develop new areas of cooperation between our two countries."

Congratulated Minister Zarif on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran’s nuclear programme. Also urged Iran to abide by its various international obligations and to continue to cooperate with the international community. We agreed that Iran’s full compliance with its international obligations will help ensure its integration with the global community.

Singapore and New Zealand enjoy a close and longstanding friendship. New Zealand was one of the first countries to recognise Singapore’s independence in 1965, and has been part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) since its establishment in 1971. New Zealand was also our first bilateral FTA partner. I look forward to working with Minister McCully to explore new areas of cooperation, such as in innovation, to enhance the strong ties between our two countries.

It was a particularly poignant reminder of our common humanity. I also visited the relocated Changi Chapel in Duntroon (Canberra), originally built by Australian Prisoners of War in Changi Prison Camp during World War II.  These are testament to the close links between our people, which pre-dates Singapore’s independence. And the sacrifice in lives by Australian soldiers in the defence of Singapore, particularly during WW II but also during the Emergency and Konfrontasi."
30332546206_10153272823081207,"Happy to be back in Australia. Arrived in Canberra this morning for a series of back to back meetings at Parliament House. Caught up with PM Malcolm Turnbull, my counterpart Julie Bishop MP, Greg Hunt MP and former PM John Howard. Also had the chance to make some new friends, including Christopher Pyne, Arthur Sinodinos, Angus Taylor MP and Tanya Plibersek.

Australia and Singapore have a longstanding and deep relationship. Singapore's troops have participated in Exercise Wallaby at Shoalwater Bay for 25 years; we have also been partners under the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) since 1971. The economic relationship is also strong; both countries complement each other. Singapore is Australia's sixth largest export destination and Australia's fifth largest investor. 

We plan to do more under the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership which we concluded in 2015. We are enhancing defence cooperation and economic integration. We are also looking to expand our cooperation in innovation and R&D. We should seize the opportunities in the ongoing Digital Revolution, which is transforming the way we live, work and play."
30332546206_10153271765296207,"Five years ago, the Great East Japan Earthquake & Tsunami cruelly took away thousands of lives and dashed the hopes and dreams of so many more. But the enduring image that has remained with me is not the widespread destruction, but the stoic, calm, orderly, patient and courageous way that the Japanese people responded in the face of great adversity. They demonstrated the Strength of the Human Spirit - and this was the theme of the photographic exhibition organised by the Singapore Red Cross and nine students from Republic Polytechnic who visited the Tohoku region recently. They were very touched to see the impact of the reconstruction work supported by funds donated by Singaporeans through the #SGRedCross.

Disasters can strike anyone anywhere anytime. It is our response that counts. May we always manifest the strength of the human spirit and our common humanity."
30332546206_10153269303586207,"Last year, Singapore and China commemorated 25 years of diplomatic relations, culminating in the exchange of state visits by Singapore President Tony Tan and Chinese President Xi Jinping. We established an All-Round Cooperative Partnership Progressing with the Times.

Singapore and China have had interactions for many centuries. Singapore has always been part of the Maritime Silk Road. The majority of our (Singapore's) citizens have ancestors from China. We enjoy a long-standing, wide-ranging relationship that transcends politics. The landmark visits by Singapore's first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew (1976) and China's former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping (1978) laid a strong foundation for the modern phase of our bilateral relations, prior to the establishment of formal diplomatic ties in 1990.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew always believed that a strong China that was positively engaged with South-east Asia would strongly benefit the region. That was why he suggested we jointly develop the Suzhou Industrial Park in 1994, our first government-to-government project, to promote the exchange of development experiences.

In 2007, when China's focus shifted to sustainable urbanisation, we embarked on our second government-to-government project - the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City. We have also launched other ""private sector-led, government-supported"" projects to respond to different aspects of China's development interests, including the Guangzhou Knowledge City, Sichuan Hi-tech Innovation Park, Nanjing Eco Hi-tech Island and Jilin Food Zone.

Last year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and President Xi launched our third government-to-government, the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI), during President Xi's state visit to Singapore. The CCI supports China's key development strategies and will draw upon the comparative advantages of Singapore and China to prototype policy innovations and enhance connectivity in the areas of finance, aviation, transport and logistics, and info-communication technology.

Singapore-China relations have been a pathfinder for China's engagement of the region. We are the first Asian country to conclude a free trade agreement (FTA) with China. Singapore was China's largest foreign investor from 2013 to 2015, and China is our largest trading partner. To support our growing economic ties, we aim to upgrade the FTA by the end of 2016.

Human resource development remains a key pillar of our cooperation. Since the mid-1990s, we have received more than 50,000 Chinese officials and cadres on training and visit programs. These exchanges facilitate mutual learning and the fostering of friendships. Bilateral cooperation has also broadened to include financial services, social governance and environmental protection, among others.

As China develops, its role in the regional and global system also evolves. Singapore remains a strong proponent of China's integration into the international community. We welcome and support China's new initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative.

Singapore and China also work closely to promote regional cooperation. This year marks the 25th anniversary of ASEAN-China dialogue relations. Over the years, ASEAN-China relations have grown rapidly, based on the principles of mutually beneficial cooperation and ASEAN centrality. ASEAN-China cooperation is substantive and broad-based. We just upgraded the ASEAN-China FTA and will have a commemorative summit this year. We also designated 2016 as the year of ASEAN-China educational cooperation. Both ASEAN and China have a strategic interest in maintaining a peaceful, stable and thriving neighbourhood.

As the current ASEAN-China dialogue relations coordinator, Singapore will work objectively with all parties to promote positive and forward-looking ASEAN-China relations. This includes sensibly managing the territorial and maritime disputes in the South China Sea between China and some ASEAN member states. As a non-claimant state, Singapore does not take positions on the claims. We encourage the claimants to exercise self-restraint and resolve their differences peacefully in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

The South China Sea is a vital lifeline for the region's survival. All countries whose trade passes through the South China Sea, or whose ships or aircraft use the South China Sea, have a legitimate interest in upholding the right of freedom of navigation and overflight, and international law. As directed by our leaders, ASEAN and China should fully abide by the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and expeditiously conclude a Code of Conduct.

Singapore-China relations have come a long way. We are old friends, and China knows that Singapore will always remain steadfast to our old friends. Singapore consistently adheres to our ""one-China"" policy. The historic meeting between Mr Xi Jinping and Mr Ma Ying-jeou in Singapore last year reflects the strong foundation of mutual trust that underpins our bilateral relations, and Singapore's hope to help foster the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations.

We have many high-level exchanges that will further strengthen our close ties. Prime Minister Lee has visited China almost every year since becoming prime minister. I look forward to working with our Chinese friends to build on our special friendship, which is based on mutual trust, respect and understanding established by generations of leaders, and to take our partnership to greater heights."
30332546206_10153263514901207,"Attended my first ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Retreat in Laos. We had a frank and constructive session on ensuring that the ASEAN Community would generate benefits for people on the ground.

An integrated ASEAN with 600 million people in a single market and single production zone has the critical mass to compete with other continental sized economies for investment.

As the world economy elsewhere continues to wobble, we need to generate new sources of growth and investment. A successful ASEAN should be able to generate significant endogenous demand, especially as we also ramp up investment in infrastructure and training to equip our people with relevant skills for future jobs.

We are also facing current transboundary challenges like terrorism, cybercrime and transboundary haze pollution. These challenges require a collaborative regional approach, and our respective agencies have to work closely together on intelligence, training and operations.

We also reviewed the state of our relationships with our major partners outside the region.

One subject of concern is the maintenance of peace and stability in the South China Sea - a vital lifeline of global trade. We reaffirmed our shared commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force, in accordance with the universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS. We also emphasised the importance of non-militarisation and self-restraint in the conduct of activities.

As coordinator for the ASEAN-China relationship, we will do our best to reflect the concerns of our ASEAN partners and to expedite the establishment of the Code of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.

Back to Singapore for a night, then off to Beijing tomorrow."
30332546206_10153263364156207,"A final salute to Mr Lee Khoon Choy, a pioneer leader of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

I recall vividly Mr Lee Kuan Yew explaining to new cabinet members the pivotal role that Mr Lee Khoon Choy played in resetting the strained relations between Singapore and Indonesia in the aftermath of Konfrontasi in our early years of independence. It was his deep appreciation of culture and history that gave him that special insight and tact that is so essential in diplomacy. 

Whenever I met him in recent years, he displayed a very sharp and inquisitive mind.

In her trademark elegant manner she explained how we overcame multiple social challenges over the past 5 decades. 113 delegations spoke, reflecting a very high level of interest in our unique development journey. Many complimented Singapore for our innovative social policies and our high ranking on the UN Human Development Index.

Many delegations admired our pragmatic approach and how we had effectively transformed the lives of our people.  There were of course the usual recommendations urging us to abolish the death penalty and to sign more human rights conventions. But we reminded them that every society is unique and has to formulate its own strategy. 

We have managed to build an inclusive Singapore and to uplift the lives of all Singaporeans through a careful balance of diverse interests.

I recall waiting in trepidation as a child for my BCG vaccination, and waiting in line for free milk (because I was deemed too skinny) in primary school. But I only just discovered that these two programmes were actually pioneered by UNICEF. Since our early years, Singapore has benefitted tremendously from UNICEF’s support for child health and nutrition. As Singapore developed over time, we became supporters rather than recipients of the UNICEF programmes.

Singapore has continued to focus on improving the lives of all our children.  We instituted comprehensive maternal and child health programmes, built top notch infrastructure especially schools – and did our best to ensure that we have comprehensive policies to enable every child to fulfil his or her potential.

Children are our source of hope, optimism and represent our ultimate commitment to the future. The future will take care of itself if we take good care of our children."

30332546206_10153205996836207,"Met a high powered group of venture capitalists at the Kauffman Fellows Global Summit this morning. The ongoing fourth industrial revolution is disrupting economic models all over the world. The new technologies, especially the ‘Internet of Everything’, artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, sophisticated robots and autonomous systems will transform the production of services and goods. Many middle class jobs are at risk if we do not get ahead of the curve. 

This is the imperative for our #SmartNation initiative. The nature of employment will change fundamentally. We need to transform our education and training schemes to future proof our people for tomorrow’s jobs. 

And it goes beyond reading, writing or arithmetic or learning to code (even that may be done by computers in future). We need to nurture the aesthetic sense of design; the ability to build new products and services; and the ability to communicate effectively. This is the real software layer of the #SmartNation.

The hardware side is almost the easier dimension. We have already installed fibre to every home. We have good mobile data connectivity. We are installing a nationwide sensor network and we believe in open data.

On the regulatory front, we have a tech-friendly government, consistent regulatory frameworks, the rule of law and a web of Free-Trade agreements that enable enterprises to ‘plug and play’ into our system.

A #SmartNation is like a smart network switch. We have to be plugged into the global value chain to connect great ideas to smart money, creating new opportunities for everyone. 

We recently announced our revised Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 (RIE2020) plans which reflects the government’s continued commitment to research and development, encouraging collaboration, enhancing capacity for innovation and technology-adaptation.

Hence, Singapore remains the best place to prototype, develop and deploy solutions to improve our society and hopefully generate solutions that may change the world. We want to get this right, to enhance the lives of Singaporeans, build stronger communities, create good jobs and exciting opportunities in our Singapore."

Singapore's efforts to continually improve the way we do things has won us plaudits internationally, most recently in a report jointly done by US News & World Report, the Wharton School and BAV Consulting.

But more importantly, this mindset of constantly looking for and putting in place new and better ways to do things, helps to secure the safety and well-being of our people.

MFA’s strategic priorities for the next five years include securing Singapore’s sovereignty by ensuring we remain relevant to the world at large; creating more opportunities for Singaporeans and enterprises venturing overseas; and improving our consular assistance for Singaporeans abroad.

 

Singapore must remain relevant and play a constructive role on the global stage. We need a rules based multilateral world order. This is how we can best protect the sovereignty and security of our tiny city state. At a regional level, ASEAN is a cornerstone of our foreign policy. Forging close mutually beneficial relationships with our immediate neighbours is essential for peace and shared prosperity in our region. A successful ASEAN also creates a platform for us to engage the major powers in a balanced manner. We will focus our Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2018 on enhancing ASEAN integration and deepening relationships with external partners.

 

Second, we will create more opportunities overseas for Singaporeans. We will help our companies and people gain access to new emerging markets, through active diplomacy, promotion of local enterprises and networking, in partnership with our economic agencies.

 

Third, we will improve our consular assistance and community outreach for Singaporeans who are travelling abroad in ever greater numbers. We will increase our use of smart technology and expand our diplomatic network to serve Singaporeans all over the world. We will work closely with the Overseas Singaporean Unit and various Singapore associations.

Singapore supports the agreement. What all Parties have achieved is a historic, global agreement which strikes the right balance between developed and developing Parties, the right balance between mitigation and adaptation, and the right balance between means of implementation and ambition. And as a result, the world is placed on a better trajectory to deal with the challenges of climate change, which affects all of us.

You can read my statement at the Committee of Paris to welcome the Paris Agreement below. You can also find the full Paris Agreement at this URL: unfccc.int/negotiation_updates

#COP21 #UNFCCC #ClimateChange #ParisAgreement

===

President of COP, Minister Laurent Fabius

Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres

Thank you, France.

The Republic of Singapore – we are a tiny island, one degree north of the equator, one quarter of our land is reclaimed from the sea.  So on behalf of my people, we express our deepest appreciation for your outstanding efforts at arriving at this historic Paris Agreement. And needless to say, we fully support this historic agreement.

Many of you have said that this is not a perfect agreement. But Voltaire – a French Enlightenment philosopher – was supposed to have quoted a wise Italian who said that “Perfect is the enemy of Good’. And so we don’t have a perfect agreement but we have a good and necessary agreement. This historic agreement sets us on a collective journey for climate safety.

We do not live in a perfect world. If this was a perfect world, the problem would have been solved many decades ago. The Kyoto Protocol was paved with good intentions, and high ambition and it was legally binding, but yet it was also fatally flawed because of the lack of universal participation.

This is why Singapore has always emphasised the need for a comprehensive, rules-based, legally binding agreement applicable to all. Without universal participation, we will fail the future generations.

But the key hurdle has always been differentiation. The challenge has always been how to create a fair system – a fair system that recognises the inequalities of the past, the diversity of the present, and the uncertainties of the future. In particular, the developed countries with historical responsibilities have to be seen to be fulfilling their prior commitments and to continue to take the lead. Without this reassurance, there would have been insufficient strategic trust for the rest of the world, the developing country Parties, to raise our ambition at great cost to ourselves.

At its core, differentiation is really about fairness. We all want to be treated fairly, but sometimes the perception of fairness is subjective. Hence there needs to be reassurance to all Parties that this agreement accounts for the past and looks towards the future. A fair deal that recognises the great diversity of our respective national circumstances. Developed countries have argued that we need to be focused on the present and the future. We agree. But developing countries also point out that the present is a function of the past and that the future is not a given.

I believe the current agreement strikes the right balance between the developed countries and the developing Parties, the right balance between mitigation and adaptation, the right balance between means of implementation and ambition.

The second core issue that Singapore focussed on was transparency. Our Chief Negotiator Mr Kwok Fook Seng exercised great effort and imagination to help refine the text for Article 13. We need transparency in order for us to build mutual trust and confidence within the structure of this agreement. Good transparency rules hold us accountable to each other. It helps demonstrate that we will do what we say.

But there is actually another more important reason for transparency. And that is that our own citizens demand that. We need to account to our own citizens back home. They want to see that we are going to do everything it takes to deal with the challenge of climate change. And transparency keeps us accountable not just to each other as Parties but to our own people whom we represent here, and it helps us to collectively move forward with confidence.

Finally, as a member of AOSIS, let me express our appreciation to all the Parties for taking into account the special circumstances of the most vulnerable low-lying island states. The commitment to hold the ‘increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 ºC’ and to ‘pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 ºC’ will give us, all the islands, some reassurance. My brothers and sisters in AOSIS will also appreciate the mechanism for ‘loss and damage’.

Mr President, on behalf of all the citizens of Singapore, it is my honour to thank you. It is not often in the lives of politicians, diplomats or [members of] civil society to be present at the genesis of a major earth-changing moment, and we have been blessed to be here, in Paris on the 12th of December 2015.  

Thank you all very much."

We are now at a critical stage of the negotiations. 'Differentiation' or fairness remains a key sticking point. We need to reassure all countries of a fair deal that recognises the great diversity of our circumstances in order to get higher levels of ambition.

30332546206_10153117410791207,"On the way to Paris for the final lap of negotiations for perhaps the most crucial global climate agreement of our generation. 

Climate change is a clear and present danger. It is a global problem and urgently needs a global solution. 

Many of you have asked me about our chances of success in the negotiations. My answer would be that I cannot guarantee success but am more optimistic than before. 

Gratifyingly, more than 150 countries have already submitted 'Intended Nationally Determined Contributions'. If all these pledges are fulfilled, more than 90% of global emissions would be covered. It would probably still be inadequate to attain our ultimate long term target, but it would represent the first time so many countries have committed collectively to lower emissions and achieve sustainable development. 

Consequently Singapore submitted our INDC ahead of the 21st Session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to demonstrate our commitment to the anticipated agreement at the meeting.  Singapore’s INDC is not conditional on external support, unlike the INDCs submitted by many non-Annex I parties. 

Others have asked me about the consequences of failure at the negotiations. 

If the negotiations in Paris do not succeed, not only will the INDCs submitted by countries be nullified, but climate change would worsen.  Some actions which we and other countries pledged to undertake would only be meaningful if all countries undertook to do the same.  

As a city state on a low-lying island, Singapore would have to review our plans at that point.  While we would still proceed with measures to improve energy efficiency and economic resilience, we would have to reallocate our limited resources to deal with increased threats, including sea level rise, floods and droughts.

That is why we must all do our best in good faith to achieve success in Paris. 

Will keep you all posted."

30332546206_10153113935871207,"Singapore is a small city state but we have big data ambitions. As a #SmartNation we believe in the power of #opendata. Open data encapsulates three attributes. First, a culture of honesty, openness, transparency and confidence. Secondly, it spurs government agencies to improve the responsiveness, efficiency and efficacy of services to citizens. Third, it provides opportunities for everyone to exercise creativity to co-create new solutions. It creates a society with a wider and deeper sense of ownership.

That is why we have been actively sharing real-time data. PM Lee Hsien Loong has always insisted that we share not just data, but data in machine readable formats, including real-time APIs. We have also revamped our data site with user-friendly data visualisations in interactive charts and maps. Take a look at www.data.gov.sg.

Open data also drives the re-engineering of government processes. An app that provides an avenue for people to make complaints and report issues for instance, means every complaint is a data point that is also visible to everyone. This encourages our people to work more efficiently, to start thinking upstream - how to prevent problems from arising, and how to work smarter to work less.

We’re also building up our data analytics capabilities to make better use of all the data that we have in order to glean new insights. I had the opportunity to speak to the geek and data community at Strata + Hadoop World this morning, along with Liu Feng Yuan, Director Government Analytics. He demonstrated some applications of data analytics in the public service, where data is converted into actionable information and enables evidence-based decisions. For example, structural topic modelling of Parliamentary debates; and Beeline - where the analysis of crowd-sourced data drives a new mode of public transport that better connects supply to demand.

Everyone can offer a solution, and if you have good ideas, we hope you will prototype and test-bed them in Singapore. If your solution works here, we can upscale and deploy it at a national level. When it is proven to work in a sophisticated city state such as ours, your solution will have applications in the rest of the world as we build the cities of the future.

Our foreign policy is a balance between realism and idealism. We will always be a small state, and history has not been kind to small states. 

We have to take the world as it is, and not as we wish it to be. But we are determined to be masters of our own destiny. 

We do our best to build a network of friends; to promote peace and stability in our region; but most of all, to preserve our sovereignty and right to determine our future. 

There are 4 dimensions to the way we advance our foreign policy. 

First, we try to always play a constructive role in international fora, to make ourselves relevant and useful. 

Second, we make common cause with our neighbouring countries, many small states and other states facing special challenges. 

Third, Singapore has to be successful, stable, secure and prosperous. Otherwise even the most eloquent diplomacy will not have credibility. 

Fourth, we must remain cohesive and united, even in the midst of diversity and political differences. After elections, we must unite as a nation. We hope the opposition understands Singapore's fundamental interests in the world and will not seek to undermine our national interests to gain political points or court a foreign audience.

As I looked round the hall, I was heartened to see many of our residents seated with their good friends, exchanging friendly banter and enjoying the company of each other.  Many of them have been friends for years, some decades.  

It is worth reflecting on this quote by the American essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson - ""A friend is a person with whom I may be sincere.  Before him I may think aloud.  I am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal, that I may drop even the undermost garments of dissolution, courtesy and second thought, which men never put off, and may deal with him with the simplicity and wholeness with which one chemical atom meets another.""

The Summit will be taking place on the eve of the ASEAN Community’s establishment at the end of the year - a historic milestone and a giant leap for ASEAN.

Over the years, ASEAN has done well to preserve peace and stability, and promote progress and development in our region. ASEAN has also built up substantive and cooperative relations with its numerous Dialogue Partners, which include the major powers.

Regional integration efforts will continue even after we establish the ASEAN Community this year. These efforts, which will have a huge positive impact on the lives of ASEAN's over 600 million people, give us much reason to be optimistic about our region’s future.

While in Kuala Lumpur, I also took the opportunity to formally make introductory calls on some of my ASEAN counterparts, such as the Foreign Ministers from Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.

It is thus fitting that perhaps the first monument of him in Europe is in the heart of the gardens on a cliff overlooking the turquoise Mediterranean Sea.
 
We were privileged to unveil his bust in the gardens. Singapore may not have the majestic landscapes and temperate climate of Catalonia, Spain.

Though geographically distant, Singapore and Iceland share common perspectives on many issues, and enjoy good cooperation in the Arctic. We are both small island states with the sea as our lifeline. Climate change and ocean governance are issues close to our hearts.

Climate change developments in the Arctic have significant impact on rising sea levels, and can also result in the opening of new shipping routes. These represent both opportunities and challenges. That is why even though Singapore is located just 1.2 degrees north of the equator, we are keenly interested in developments in the Arctic.

In 2013, Singapore was admitted as an observer state at the Arctic Council, the premier forum for inter-governmental cooperation amongst the Arctic states. This year, we are privileged to host The Arctic Circle Singapore Forum, which brings the international dialogue on Arctic issues to Singapore and to this part of the world."

I am grateful to the Chinese Calligraphy Society of Singapore (CCSS) for its multi-racial outreach, promoting the traditional art of Chinese calligraphy to Singaporeans of all ethnic backgrounds. Singapore is blessed to be a society where we can all appreciate our diverse heritage and cultures.

Last week, I attended the graduation ceremony of some students. They had completed a three-year course at the Singapore Senior Citizen Calligraphy University Centre, which was established by CCSS. Their average age was 64, and the most senior among them was 81. Their calligraphy works were impressive to behold.

These issues concern all countries, but are particularly salient for small island developing states like Singapore, given our vulnerability. 

The transboundary haze that has afflicted our region for far too long is a man-made tragedy and a crime. A handful of people and big companies are profiting at the expense of the environment and of the rest of society. We need a multi-faceted solution, and that includes intensifying regional and international cooperation to apply effective legal and commercial pressure on those few errant companies.

The haze has catalysed a rising demand for responsible and sustainable business practices in our region. In many other places around the world - the US, the EU, India and China - we also see a growing trend of consumers wanting goods that are demonstrably sustainably produced and demanding greater accountability and transparency in the supply chains.

We hope that in response to this growing consumer movement, businesses will see that it is in their own long-term interest to move towards a more environmentally-friendly approach, characterised by enhanced transparency in the supply chain and procurement processes.

Sustainable development is not an optional luxury. We need political will, responsible business behaviour, ethical investors and vigilant consumers to pledge our common commitment towards a sustainable future."

Our friendship with Denmark began when historical maritime trade routes brought both countries together. Our exchanges have since evolved to include many other areas such as education, arts and culture, research and development, water management, and environmental technology.

Denmark has had a long tradition in urban development and I believe there is much we can learn from each other. After all, we face similar urban challenges as countries like Denmark - managing a growing city, ageing population, and the need to ensure resource sustainability.

In agrarian times, change occurred over millennia. The industrial revolution unfolded over two centuries. But the digital revolution is accelerating exponentially, especially over the past two decades.

We should have the courage to “experiment, build and compete” by offering smart solutions for urban challenges of the future.

The way we book flights, choose hotels, or find a shopping destination have changed. Tech-savvy travellers are looking for unique experiences that generate personal memories. And even more than before, people will demand customisation, personalisation, immersive experiences and bespoke services.

“Reboot” is a fitting theme for the Web in Travel Conference I attended yesterday. Tourism players were encouraged to “reboot” and reinvent themselves to stay relevant in this new digital world. 

The travel industry will have to keep up with technological change or face the risk of obsolescence. Those who get it and ride on the opportunities will have much to gain as their tech-enabled solutions get applied, widely used and commoditised.

Singapore aims to remain as a major travel hub for the decades to come; we have millions of passengers passing through our airport annually. Singapore is the best place to test-bed new technological products, new tech-enabled services for travellers.

Pak Luhut and I had a good discussion on a broad range of topics, including the ongoing haze situation. We agreed that there was the need to take decisive action against the errant companies which were engaging in illegal slash-and-burn techniques. This was why we had been asking for the names of the companies, so that legal action can be taken against them, and we hoped to receive the names soon. We agreed that a greater regional effort was required, and that ASEAN as a whole needed to do more. 

We also discussed developments in the region, as well as bilateral cooperation, such as our longstanding collaboration in the Batam, Bintan and Karimun Special Economic Zones."

Intrigued by the geeks, makers, creative and futurists at FutureEverything Singapore conference at ArtScience Museum on Saturday. 

Revolutions start with some apparently crazy people chasing the impossible. We are now living at the cusp of a technological revolution. 

I shared some thoughts on the impending crises and opportunities in energy, water and food. 

Another revolution is occurring with 3D printing or Additive Manufacturing. I believe it means the age of mass production will be replaced by the age of mass customisation. There will be a global transformation of manufacturing chains and logistics. 

Instead of shipping containers of goods, it will be polylactone and raw materials that are shipped to homes - printed according to customised downloaded designs. 

Technology is weaving itself into our lives,  revolutionising the way we live, work and play. Instead of fearing the future, make use of the opportunity that technology offers to improve our way of life. 

Big data & super-intelligence will lead to the loss of routine middle class and middle management jobs. If you are in the IT industry, and cannot code or design or be an engineer or maker - your job will be at risk.

In the future, imagine Everything-as-a-software-service. This will completely disrupt conventional Education, Healthcare, Entertainment, Culture, Politics & Society. 

We are building a #SmartNation in equal parts of paranoia and optimism.

We must be bold, dream big and co-create the future together. Don't be a passive consumer whose only recourse is to complain. If something can be done better, go create the solution - be the solution. 

So if you've got a wild idea, dare to make it, bring it to Singapore,  test it, and prove that it works. Singapore is the ideal place to make the future, even if the future we dream may seem a little crazy to some for now.

30332546206_10153046619446207,"Why are children so important? Our children represent new possibilities, new hopes, rejuvenation, vitality, fearlessness and optimism. A society with many children is one that believes in the future and will invest in the future. On the night my daughter was born, I discovered the meaning of unconditional parental love and total responsibility for a new life. I realised how much my parents loved me, how I could never repay them. I finally understood why family ties are the fundamental bedrock of human society. 

This is the real reason we encourage people to marry and have children. It is not economics that is our primary concern. It is the tone and outlook of our society that is of far greater importance.

I contributed a chapter to the Singapore Children's Society’s latest book “Speaking of Children” based on a speech I made in 2007 (http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/speeches/view-html?filename=20070928987.htm).

To deal with challenges such as an ageing population, high urban density, transport and urban mobility, we need smart solutions that convert our strategic vulnerabilities into strategic opportunities, and make our country more liveable, sustainable and resilient. We need to take a long term view and appreciate that development is not a simple linear process.

Singapore and India enjoy an excellent state of relations, and are celebrating the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year. We will be elevating bilateral relations to a Strategic Partnership during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Singapore next month.
 
Minister Swaraj and I agreed that the Strategic Partnership should be ambitious and forward-looking with concrete deliverables. We also discussed Singapore’s contributions to India in the areas of Smart Cities and skills development, for example, Singapore’s master-planning of Amaravati (Andhra Pradesh’s new capital city), and support of the Centre of Excellence in Tourism Training in Udaipur, Rajasthan.

Thrilled to ride in Singapore's autonomous vehicle created by I2R/A*STAR. Although we are not the first in the world to work on AVs, I2R/A*STAR did an incredible job in 9 short months.
 
I am glad that the collaborations with industry partners and research institutes to trial the use of AVs in Singapore has been a success. Kudos to the Ministry of Transport and LTA for facilitating this project and for being flexible with policies and regulations.
 
We need innovation in both technology and policy.
 
Unpleasant commutes are the last thing we want to start our days with! In land-scarce Singapore, where 12% of our land is set aside for roads and transport infrastructure, we really need to optimise the use of our limited space to move people efficiently, safely and reliably.
 
Imagine the possibilities with AVs being deployed in the future via Beeline.sg - an innovative on-demand mode of transport utilising crowdsourced requests and anonymised transport data. Beeline.sg is already undergoing trial right now. We could ultimately have a real-time demand-driven intelligent transport system that optimises use of land, reduces reliance on our limited manpower but also gives us all more pleasant rides.
 
As we move forward with our #SmartNation journey, we will harness technology to address the needs of our citizens. A key priority is to revolutionise our transport landscape to create a seamless transport experience for our residents. Working alongside industry partners and policy makers, we can address the urban mobility challenges we face in Singapore. We can be an ideal testbed for new technologies.
 
Congratulations to the team at I2R/A*STAR for your achievements. Thanks for arranging the demonstration ride for Janil and me. Watch this space!

The pace of innovation and the adoption of emerging technologies is accelerating, and new business models are being invented constantly.

At the Financial Times-Asian Consumer Insight Smarter World Summit yesterday, I highlighted that businesses need to urgently take advantage of technology and data in order to survive. Business as usual is not tenable. Those who can adapt or ride the technology wave are the ones who will reap the biggest fortunes.

I believe Singapore has all the ingredients to succeed in our #SmartNation drive. We are establishing a foundation that promotes sharing of open data for co-creation, an ecosystem that supports technopreneurship and a culture of experimentation. The government is committed to prototyping potential solutions to urban challenges, and will scale up the viable solutions nationwide – just like what we did for water desalination and recycling through reverse osmosis membrane technology.

Our top priority was water security - to ensure that Singapore could withstand droughts and import disruption. The major investments made in desalination and NEWater, in the past and in ongoing projects, have paid off. We had peace of mind despite the droughts that occurred. 

We have also made steady progress in upgrading our drainage infrastructure to enhance flood resilience. Phase 2 of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System will put our sewerage system in good stead for many decades. The expansion of Pulau Semakau will give us another twenty years of capacity.  

We were able to restart the building of new iconic hawker centres and the changes in policies have resulted in rentals coming down. 

We introduced the Progressive Wage Model, and I am glad cleaners were the first group to benefit from higher wages and employment terms. 

I was heavily involved with climate change negotiations at the UN, and I hope that we will have a global comprehensive and ambitious agreement by the end of the year to deal with this existential global threat. 

The most difficult issue has been recurrent transboundary haze. Although we passed the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act, there are major constraints that can only be overcome by effective investigation and enforcement by authorities in our neighbouring countries. Regional collaboration needs to be enhanced significantly. 

I have learnt that so many of the most pressing and complex  challenges of the future will require patient but purposeful negotiations and deep collaboration with multiple stakeholders. In this spirit, I look forward to my next posting at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and am very grateful to the Prime Minister for his confidence.

World leaders are gathered here in New York City for the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, an ambitious global development agenda that sets out 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets for countries to achieve.  The goals and targets cut across areas such as poverty elimination, water and sanitation, gender equality, sustainable cities and climate change. You can read more about the 2030 Agenda at https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld. 

At the Summit, I shared about Singapore’s sustainable development story and how we have pursued sustainable development since our independence 50 years ago. It has always been Singapore’s belief that a dynamic economy, an inclusive society, and a sustainable environment are not zero-sum trade-offs, but a virtuous cycle of development.  

I also announced the launch of the Singapore’s Sustainable Development Programme. This is a special package that we have come up with to provide technical assistance and capacity building to developing countries in the areas of leadership and governance, sustainable cities, and water and sanitation solutions. It is our way of paying forward as Singapore has benefitted from technical assistance and cooperation in our early days of independence. 

Finally, I brought up the issue of transboundary haze from forest and peatland fires in Southeast Asia as an example of how many sustainable development issues cannot be addressed unilaterally. I called for closer regional and international cooperation to apply legal and commercial pressure in order to prevent errant companies from profiting from unsustainable land and forest clearing.

30332546206_10153015871311207,"Ongoing investigations by NEA have indicated that the haze may have been related to fires in lands held via concessions by four Indonesian companies, namely:

1. PT Rimba Hutani Mas;
2. PT Sebangun Bumi Andalas Wood Industries;
3. PT Bumi Sriwijaya Sentosa; and
4. PT Wachyuni Mandira.
 
NEA has sent Preventive Measure Notices under Section 9 of the THPA to these four companies, requesting them to carry out the following:
1. Deploy fire-fighting personnel to extinguish or prevent the spread of any fire on land owned or occupied by them;
2. Discontinue, or not to commence, any burning activities on such land;
3. Submit to NEA any plan of action to extinguish any fire on such land or to prevent its recurrence. 
 
In addition, NEA has served on Asia Pulp & Paper Company Ltd in Singapore (APP) a notice under Section 10 of the THPA, seeking information from APP on its subsidiaries in Singapore and Indonesia, as well as measures taken by its suppliers in Indonesia to put out fires in their concessions.

NEA has also written to the Indonesian authorities yesterday to request for the names of errant companies responsible for causing fires and the resultant transboundary haze. The information will be relevant for NEA's investigations.
NEA will share more information when available.
 
The Singapore government is currently examining how to apply more economic pressure against errant companies. Where possible, we will share the results of our investigations with the public, particularly because the THPA makes errant companies liable for civil claims. 

The Government will review its procurement process to promote green procurement. For example, we look into how we can support companies which are recognised by their industry or by international bodies to have instituted sustainable practices.  As far as possible, this should take into account the practices of their suppliers further down the supply chain to ensure that they meet social and environmental standards. 

We will therefore expect companies to be more transparent about their supply chains, particularly those involved in the palm oil and forestry sectors. Ultimately, errant companies must know that there is a price to be paid for damaging our health, environment and economy."

30332546206_10153000039651207,"Today is Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s birthday. Mr Lee was a ‘Greenie’, even before it was fashionable to be one. 

50 years ago, despite a much lower GDP, he decided not to have coal-fuelled power plants in order to preserve our blue skies. Mr Lee and our pioneer leaders had the profound insight that the growing the economy and protecting the environment was not a zero sum game. 

I attended a Panel Discussion on Sustainability in Agri-Food Consumer Goods organised by Netherlands Chamber of Commerce (DutchCham) this morning. We were honored to have Jan Peter Balkenende Former Prime Minister of the Netherlands as a panelist. He has been a good friend of Singapore for a long time. 

I emphasised that environmental issues, like climate change and transboundary haze, are all symptoms of a myopic view to development. The bottom-line for businesses is to generate profit. But it is also important to note that companies that are sustainable, responsible and do the right thing for the long term can ultimately turn out to be more profitable. 

Governments have a role to play by building regulatory and legislative frameworks, insisting on transparency and full accounting from companies. We need a system that rewards the companies that do the right thing. This can only be achieved through a partnership among the government, businesses, and NGOs.

After all, the cost of dealing with environmental impact is lower, if you planned for it and invested in the infrastructure right from the beginning. To do a clean-up after messing up the environment is going to be more costly."

The wind pattern is also quite variable. Consequently, we have been experiencing peaks of high haze over the past few days. Overall the air quality is classified as ‘Unhealthy’ and may escalate into a ‘Very Unhealthy’ range from time to time.
 
We have three major objectives during these challenging times; 1) to protect our population; 2) to work with the Indonesians to put out the fires and identify the culprits; and 3) to send an unequivocal signal to companies involved in the fires that we take this very seriously. We are prepared to exercise the full extent of law to bring these companies to task.
 
The various government agencies have put their action plans in place. From tomorrow, MOH will be activating its Haze Subsidy Scheme to help Singaporeans with their haze-related medical needs. MOM, SNEF and NTUC have urged all employers to take special care of their workers during this period and the schools have put in place their haze contingency plans.

30332546206_10152975861376207,"Some awkward questions for Dr Chee Soon Juan. 

How much will Dr Chee Soon Juan spend and on what?
Will Dr Chee Soon Juan declare the total bill he intends to spend on all his plans? 

What taxes will Dr Chee Soon Juan raise and from whom?
Will Dr Chee declare the new and additional taxes he will raise and from whom? Is he going to raise income tax, corporate tax and/or GST? What impact will these taxes have on the middle class and local companies who cannot relocate to lower tax countries?

What essential expenditure and services will Dr Chee Soon Juan cut?
For example, the SDP has said that it intends to cut $5.75 billion from our current defence spending. $5.75 billion is at least 40% of our current defence budget. Is it responsible for Dr Chee and his team to ask for such a huge cut in defence spending given the current global and regional climate. What other national programmes and policies does Dr Chee intend to cut? 

Dr Chee's 'cut and paste' and irresponsible policies will lead Singapore to bankruptcy and put us at grave risk. 

The SDP now claims that its 'cut and paste' healthcare policy is modelled after the French system. Will Dr Chee tell Singaporeans what are the French rates for personal income tax, corporate tax and GST (known as VAT in France)?

Dr Chee's ideas will lead Singapore on the path of much higher taxes, higher national debts for our children and put our national security at risk.

An interesting question came up yesterday during a REACH forum. Should all MPs be full time MPs and should we lower the MP allowance?

I would seriously review MP allowances. But that is not actually the key issue. 

The more fundamental question is what kind of leaders do we need. 

I believe three pre-requisites are essential. 
Honesty
Competence
Compassion

Honesty. The PAP insists on absolute honesty. Full disclosure. No cheating. No lying. No favours. The moment we get dishonest politicians in Parliament -that will be the beginning of the end.

Competence. In many countries, politicians are full time politicians. In fact their entire career has been spent standing for elections since they were students. They have never worked in a real job, run a business or practised a profession. We believe that it is better to get people with real life experience into Parliament. The question of whether they should be full time or part time is actually secondary. The real question is whether they can serve the residents well, given their experience and commitment.

Compassion. This is the heart of it all. We need people with a heart to serve other people. Without this element - politics is downright dangerous.

If we can all agree that these three elements are absolutely essential, then we can explore reducing allowances. One seductive notion is to eliminate the allowance totally. Make it zero. 

Let’s do a thought experiment. If the allowance was zero, only two kinds of people can afford to be full time MPs. First, wealthy people - but hardly representative. Second, people who see politics as an avenue to earn money on the side - corruption.

So zero is not an option. Nevertheless we can, and should continually review this question of a reasonable allowance. This is something that can be debated on another day. 

But never forget the more crucial issues of honesty, competence and compassion. These are non-negotiable.

30332546206_10152962939201207,"The Singapore Environment Council (SEC) celebrated its 20th Anniversary last evening,  I highlighted the three phases of Singapore’s environment journey. 50 years ago, we were blessed that our founding PM Lee Kuan Yew was green even before it became fashionable. He understood instinctively that even when we had to grow the economy, the environment was the flip side of the same coin. Being green and sustainable, having clean air and clean water was hard-coded into our organisational DNA.  

In the second phase, we knew that it cannot just be a government-directed effort and the people, represented through organisations like the SEC, needed to take ownership of this agenda. 

Now we are in the third phase. We need the involvement of the corporate sector. I am glad to note that SEC has embarked on this through its efforts in training and recruiting more enlightened corporate members who understand that being sustainable is not only the right thing to do, but that it also makes business sense. I hope for an equal partnership with the Government, the people and companies working together, so that we can secure our future and make sure that the next 50 years of our environmental journey will be even greener, more sustainable and secure."

Dr Teo Ho Pin will stand again in Bukit Panjang SMC.

Dr Teo has served in Bukit Panjang for almost twenty years, most of which as Chairman of the Town Council. He is also been Mayor of North West CDC. He knows everyone, every nook and cranny of his constituency and indeed our entire GRC. Both he and I have been here since the original formation of the GRC in 2001. 

We stand not just on our track record of work done on the ground and in Parliament, but also on our detailed plans for the future of our area. These are practical plans that have been generated after extensive consultations with our residents.  

Our residents know us very well by now. They know our values,  what we stand for, our emphasis on quick action, our attention to details and total commitment to every single resident. 

Bukit Panjang town, Bukit Timah, Clementi and Ulu Pandan have been transformed over the past decade and a half. We are fortunate to have many residents and extended families who have lived here for many decades. They are the best judges of this transformation. 

We have worked hard to improve transport and increase community facilities. At the same time, this is also perhaps the greenest constituency as we include much of the Nature Reserve. We have increased access to our natural heritage in a sensitive and sustainable manner. 

But this election is more than just a local election. It is about the future direction of Singapore and the people you trust to lead Singapore into the future.

Much has been achieved in Singapore over 50 years. But our future challenges are no less profound. 

We have to completely restructure our economy - to one based on value creation, innovation and enterprise. We have to keep creating good jobs for everyone. Our education system and life long learning journeys have to give us future skills for future good jobs. At the same time, we have to ensure equity and social mobility - hallmarks of a fair and just society. We also have to deal with the consequences of one of the fastest ageing societies in the world. Our retirement and healthcare systems have to be sustainable for the long term. 

We believe in growth, hard work, innovation, opportunities for all and active intervention to uplift the most vulnerable in our society. 

But beyond the arguments on policy, the voters will also have to decide who they trust with their children's future. Character, integrity and honesty are non-negotiable for the PAP. Many people ask us why we are so obsessed with it. We believe this is the first prerequisite of public office.

I am sure the voters will scrutinise the candidates very carefully. Our promise to our residents is that we will continue to care for you, protect your families, invest and build our collective destiny together.

30332546206_10152946695246207,"Singapore has been supplying additional potable water to Johor since 14 August 2015 in order to help our closest neighbour during their period of water rationing. This is in response to a request for assistance from Badan Kawalselia Air Johor (BAKAJ), Johor’s water regulatory body.

The current dry weather has severely affected water levels in Johor’s Sungei Layang dam, and BAKAJ has commenced water rationing in parts of Johor Bahru from 16 August to 15 September 2015.

BAKAJ had requested PUB to provide an additional 5 to 6 million gallons per day (mgd) of potable water to supplement the water supply in Johor Bahru during the period of water rationing. PUB has agreed to help, and has been injecting the additional supply of potable water from the Johor River Waterworks (JRWW) that PUB operates in Johor.

This arrangement is temporary and subject to regular review. This will not affect the water supply in Singapore. There has been some rain in Singapore recently and PUB has increased its production of NEWater and desalinated water to meet local demand, allowing water levels in local reservoirs to remain healthy.

The dry weather has affected water levels in Linggiu Reservoir in Johor, which has dipped slightly to 54.18%, from 54.5% two weeks ago, and is at an all-time low. Linggiu Reservoir, which is operated by PUB, improves the yield of water from the Johor River from which Johor and Singapore draw water.

Over the years, PUB has, at Johor’s request, supplied about 16 million gallons of potable water per day to Johor. This latest request will see Singapore temporarily supplying up to 22 mgd of potable water to meet Johor’s needs in the present dry weather situation. PUB remains committed to working with BAKAJ and relevant agencies to increase water resources in Johor."

30332546206_10152943926371207,"Reply by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, to Parliamentary Questions on Hawker Centre Pricing and Managing Agents by Ms Kuik Shiao-Yun

Reply by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:

1          Hawker centres are a unique Singapore feature and they are in my opinion, essential social infrastructure. They are places where Singaporeans from all walks of life can gather, interact and enjoy fresh food at affordable prices. Over 85% of our hawkers today pay less than $1,500 per month in rent, and in fact, 41% (2,400) of them are paying subsidised rental ranging from $160 to $384. Three years ago, we took further policy changes to remove the speculative elements from hawker stalls. For instance, now we insist that all hawker stalls have to be personally operated. The stalls are not a way for landlords to make money. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has disallowed the practice of assignments and subletting. Furthermore NEA also abolished the concept of “reserve rent” for hawker stalls during the bidding process. NEA offers available vacant stalls at monthly tender exercises, and accepts all valid competitive bids. This has resulted in a current situation where about half of the successful bids are now below 85% of the assessed market rent. The tendered rentals have been falling and in fact fell by about 3.4% last year- the lowest successful tendered rental is now $1 a month. 

2          To provide Singaporeans with even more affordable food options, we announced that the Government is building 20 new hawker centres, particularly in estates that have fewer cooked food stalls. Another trial that we are embarking on is the appointment of social enterprises, to act as managing agencies. For instance, NEA has appointed NTUC Foodfare Co-operative Ltd and Fei Siong Food Management Pte Ltd as managing agents to run two new hawker centres at Bukit Panjang and Hougang respectively on a not-for-profit basis. These social enterprises, we hope, would bring new ideas based on their experience in food and beverage operations. We hope they will diversify food options, enhance the dining experience for patrons, and raise the productivity for hawker centres, all the while keeping food prices affordable.  For example, and this is a useful measure, both NTUC Foodfare and Fei Siong will offer discounted bulk purchasing of ingredients to help hawkers to reduce the cost of raw material. In fact it is the cost of ingredients and raw materials that is the biggest cost driver for hawkers stalls, not rentals. Fei Siong has also launched a programme to nurture a new generation of hawkers by providing training and opportunities to enter this field, and we believed these initiatives are important, and we hoped it will help ensure the sustainability of hawkers in the future.  

3          NEA also welcomes other initiatives that the social enterprises may decide to roll out. For instance, they have insisted that the hawkers in these two centres offer at least a few budget meals on their menu.  Over and above that, for low-income families who need help with their basic needs, the Government provides additional cash assistance and vouchers through the ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance Scheme.  These schemes are all design to ensure that there is always a low cost option for food on the table. 

4          But there is one cost that had gone up, and that is manpower costs, particularly because we have increased the wages for cleaners through progressive wages. Members of this house will recall that in fact MEWR was the first to move on progressive wages by effecting legislative changes, and this has resulted in what I believed is a well-justified and well-deserved increase in wages for cleaners. There has also been some increase for hawker assistants. Again, I would expect that members of the house would support these wage increases. Our hawkers will have to prepare for the future where wage cost will be higher and like many other small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore, will have to try to figure how to do more with less manpower and basically, it is about enhancing productivity. 

5          Hawkers are free to set their own food prices taking into consideration their own operating costs, market competition, and what patrons are willing to pay. They do not need to submit their prices to NEA for prior approval.   

6          The social enterprises who are managing our hawker centres on a pilot basis are required to submit audited accounts and detailed management reports to NEA.  NEA will therefore ensure that the interests of hawkers, cleaners, hawker assistants and patrons are well taken care of, and we believed that these will enable us to ensure that hawker centres continue to fulfil their very important social function in Singapore.

7          Thank you Mdm speaker. 

 

Supplementary questions by Ms Kuik Shiao-Yun:

Thank you minister for your response. I have two supplementary questions: the first is with regards to the sharing of responsibility for keeping food affordable for the working class.  I think a lot of hawkers are quite sympathetic to the need of keeping food affordable, but they find the idea of price caps quite offensive, because it feels like the responsibility of keeping food prices affordable is being passed on to them by the social enterprise in-charge, and by extension, the agencies that endorses them. So the perception, and it may be wrong, is how can the hawkers be the one held responsible for keeping the food affordable. Can the Ministry clarify how it works with all stakeholders to help them understand how they all share the responsibility of keeping food prices fair.  

The second question is about price versus value. There is a lot of unhappy sentiment on the ground that the discussion about hawker food is overly centered on price rather than value and the idea that what if we are keeping food prices down because of cost cutting and low quality, low nutritious ingredient. How does the Ministry work with the stakeholders to not just look at keeping prices fair, but keeping the value high, in particular cultural heritage value, and nutritional value of hawker food?

 

Reply by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:

8          The issue of affordable food is very important. It goes beyond simple economics. This is an important social issue, and dare I say, even a politically charged issue in Singapore. My approach is very simple. I believe there must always be a low-cost option on the table, and this low-cost option should be available on the table in a place where people from all walks of life have access to. This democratisation of the dining experience in Singapore is something valuable. It is part of the social glue that binds us together. It is part of what defines us as Singaporeans. Once we accept that there is value in ensuring that there is always a low-cost option on the table, the next question you have correctly identified is that there are multiple stakeholders. 

9          There used to be this thinking, which fortunately has now been debunked, that the main cost-driver was rentals. With policy changes over the last several years, during the term of this government, as well as the data that has emerged, it is very clear now that rentals are not the major cost-drivers. Nevertheless, as the minster-in-charge of NEA, I have done my best to push rentals down, and I have done that by increasing the supply, removing the speculative element, and ensuring that everyone knows this is about food, and not about property at play. I have also done that by removing reserve rents, and I have also instructed NEA to accept all valid competitive bids, and hence, as I have told you, the lowest successful tendered bid to-date is $1. All that has been achieved. The data is also out there to prove that 85% of our hawkers pay less than $1,500 of rental. Rent is coming down, and it is not the main component of operating cost. If anyone has lost out due to the rental reduction, it is the main landlord which in this case is the Government. I am prepared to take that because I believe this is social infrastructure.

10        The next important issue is about manpower, and yes I stand guilty as charged for raising the cost of cleaning in Singapore. But I think I stand with the support of all of you that we were right to impose progressive wages and to increase wages and employment conditions for cleaners. So we lowered rentals; but yes, manpower cost has gone up. 

11        Now we have further evidence that the key cost-driver is actually not manpower, but ingredients, and that is really the reason why I was so keen to get social enterprises involved, in particular NTUC FoodFare. Members would recall, maybe four decades or more when we were worried about the cost of raw food, the advent of NTUC FairPrice, the social enterprise supplying raw food, at very competitive prices. It was not subsidised prices but very competitive prices. It had a salutary effect on the rest of the market. I am trying and I am hoping that this same approach would work for cooked food as well. Hence, I am happy that NTUC FoodFare took up the challenge. They are not landlords, they are managing agents, and I told them very clearly that my main objective is to help keep costs affordable as well as bring down cost of raw ingredients for hawkers. Everything else is an extra. 

12        Yes I know there has been some disquiet about this insistence on budget needs, but actually this is not a new idea. All of us would remember school canteens and even today, workplace canteens, where in exchange for low or subsidized rentals, the hawkers sell their food at low prices, or even at prices approved by the landlord. This is a system,in which by having some price restraint, you are prepared to accept lower rentals, and prepared to bring down overall cost of doing business. So, I hope you can appreciate that it is a balancing act between hawkers, employees, patrons, and the need to make it affordable to everyone. So this is the journey that we have embarked on, this is a pilot in a sense as we have only a few centres that are run by social enterprises. Let us take a data-driven approach, watch the prices, quality of food and nutrition, and calibrate the policy along the way. 

13        My final point is that we will inject more transparency into the system. Since I am also overseeing Smart Nation initiative, we are looking at having apps which will display prices of food in every single store in Singapore, maybe in real time, maybe even to allow crowd-sourcing function so that you can tell us whether you think it is value for money, and maybe even the experts can assess the nutritional value and the rest of it. So let us give the system a chance, and I want to assure all the stakeholders in this important institution that we are doing our best to make sure that hawkers and patrons gain. If anyone loses it will be NEA and the government, but we can and should be prepared to tolerate.

14        Thank you Ms Kuik. Thank you Madam Speaker.

 

Supplementary Question by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:

Many were concerned that with the rising manpower cost and manpower shortage, whether the standard of cleanliness and the hygiene level of the hawker centres would also be affected. I would like to know whether the Ministry has plans to actually incentivize and encourage all the stakeholders to do more to ride on the new technologies in the way they handle and redesign the work process for the cleaners, including food waste management and dish-washing.   

  

Reply by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:

14        Madam Speaker, the answer is yes.

 

Supplementary Question by Mr Lim Biow Chuan:

As I represent the Consumer Association, may I ask the Minister that when we do survey for hawker food, many of the stalls do not put up the prices of the food that they sell. Since this is a new approach, can I ask NEA to also require the food sellers to prominently display every item of the food that they sell?

 

Reply by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: 

15        I think that is an idea worth studying. Although I do not really want the whole facade filled with prices and menus. Let be a bit practical. We all go to hawker centres; we all have our favourite stalls; and we all know what our favourite options are. I think by and large, the system works. Although hawkers are free to charge what they think the market will bear, I think Singaporeans vote with their feet and their stomachs. That is usually how it works in practice.  

 

Supplementary Question by Mr Lim Biow Chuan:

Just to clarify, the complaints from consumers were that when they buy food from the hawker stalls, they do not know (the price). If I pick one fish, one dish, one meat, I got absolutely no clue – sometimes it might be $4 and sometimes it might be $10. It is a matter of being transparent for the consumers. I thought I should clarify that point with the Minister.

A key challenge will be integration and inter-operability, allowing innovation to proliferate and avoiding vendor lock-in. 
 
That is why we are working with ISO to promulgate draft standards for IoT deployment in Singapore. 

The guidelines cover sensor network standards, IoT foundational standards and domain-specific standards.

Sensor network standards ensure data collected from various monitoring devices can be effectively transmitted, integrated and analysed in real-time. IoT foundational standards support sensor data processing and analytics to ensure that data gathered over the network is accurate and intelligently synthesised for making smart decisions. Lastly, domain-specific standards guide the industry in developing new smart solutions to improve healthcare, mobility, and urban living, while ensuring user safety.

Singapore is a small city state. We cannot dictate the standards - but because we facilitate innovation, enable prototyping and test-bedding, and because people know that we are neutral, fair, competent and honest – we can play a small but relevant role in establishing standards for the world."

This is a regulating reservoir that releases water to reduce seawater intrusion into Johor River. It is the key to ensuring the river can provide 250 million gallons per day for us. 

It looked very different today from my first visit in 2011 when the reservoir was full. 

In fact, the probable onset of the El Nino dry spell means this is likely to drop further, compromising our biggest source of water. 

I hope all Singaporeans will conserve our precious water. 

Our local reservoirs may look full, but this is only because PUB has been running our desalination and NEWater plants at almost full capacity. 

We are grateful for the additional safety margin that these desalination and NEWater plants have given us. In 12 years,  we increased our capacity from desalination and NEWater from 0% to 55% of our water needs today. We are currently constructing another NEWater plant that will be ready in end 2016. We are also going to build a third desalination plant by 2017. There are more projects in the pipeline. 

In 1965, we had only 3 reservoirs. Today we have 17 local reservoirs. 

No other country has pursued water security with such a single minded focus on such a scale. Without these investments we would be in a very precarious position. 

This is why we should be concerned, but not alarmed. 

Water has always been an existential issue for us since independence 50 years ago. We are In a much stronger and secure position now, but can never take things for granted. We have to constantly be aware of potential problems and prepare well ahead of time.

First, government will share extensive real-time data in the public domain through data.gov.sg. This is something our PM Lee Hsien Loong himself has insisted on. We are still expanding the datasets and building consistent APIs. The ministries and public agencies will also share their intended outcomes - leaving the private and people sector to offer innovative solutions. 

Second, to equip our people with the tools, skills, resources and networks so that they can use the latest technology to solve real world problems. 

Third, public agencies may commission, licence or buy the most promising solutions generated if they are fit for purpose and cost effective.

30332546206_10152901166121207,"Held a constructive meeting at the Ministerial Steering Committee on Transboundary Haze in Jakarta. Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar has emphasised that Indonesia is fully committed to resolving this long standing problem. 

On a hopeful note, the number of hot spots this year has been much lower than before. However, the likely El Nino dry spell in the latter part of this year means the risk remains. 

We are making very slow progress in operationalising the ASEAN Haze Monitoring System. The software has been fully developed by Singapore. But Indonesia and Malaysia are still unable to publish concession maps in the public domain. In the meantime I have requested that Indonesia share information on a G-to-G basis that would enable us to confirm the severity of the fires and the identity of the companies causing the #haze. These companies would potentially be in breach of both Indonesian and Singapore law. 

We will stay vigilant and do our best to work with the other ASEAN governments to hold errant companies accountable."

We discussed how technology can be effectively applied to enhance the quality of our lives, provide more opportunities for all in a fair society and maintain cohesion in the midst of great diversity. At the end of the day, it is not the economy or technology but really whether people have meaningful and fulfilling lives. 
 
I thought it was befitting for the meeting to be held at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the latest UNESCO World Heritage Site, as it serves as a reminder to us that a smart and sustainable city should also be a beautiful one that nourishes the soul."

30332546206_10152871898576207,"Proud of the way NEA exercised imagination and innovation to extend the lifespan of our Palau Semakau landfill site. 

In 2011, NEA told me that Palau Semakau will reach full capacity by 2016. Although the lagoon was designed for future expansion, the traditional method of preparation would have required very large volumes of reclamation sand and very high costs. I suggested creating a single 157 hectare cell for the incinerated ash without subdivision - in order to maximise capacity and to avoid the requirement to create sand bunds. NEA engineers went back to the drawing board and came up with a novel method using a floating mobile pontoon to distribute the ash efficiently. 

This not only saved a lot of money, but also increases Phase II's landfill capacity by 44% as compared with a multi-cell layout. Semakau will now serve us to 2035 and possibly beyond.

Particular attention was paid to environmental protection and conservation. The lagoon's corals were harvested and transplanted to the Sisters' Islands, and its fish have been caught and released to the sea. 

Excess water in the cell is treated at a floating wastewater plant, the first in Southeast Asia, before being discharged into the sea. 

In fact, a fish farm thrives in the waters just off where the Phase II lagoon is on Pulau Semakau, and we had an enjoyable visit there with some of my grassroots volunteers this morning as well. A healthy mangrove forest and tidal mudflats teeming with marine life have also co-existed with the landfill since its inception in 1999 and will be open for visiting again soon. 

I often tell foreign friends that Pulau Semakau is probably the only landfill site in the world that is also a tourist attraction!

This project represents Singapore at its best. We have always struggled with existential constraints and have had to carefully plan for the long-term. Pulau Semakau is a worthy showcase of engineering and conservation - indeed, it is our local companies which have executed this project. This success is their calling card for access to global opportunities. 

Semakau will also ultimately also be a source of reclaimed land where future generations can live and work on safely and securely. In the meantime, we still need to do our best to recycle and minimise generated waste to prolong Semakau's landfill lifespan for as long as possible."

I shared this big dream in my speech at the opening of the SIWW Technology and Innovation Summit (STIS) this morning. I am convinced we can make significant progress to achieve a stretch target of halving our energy imports for water production within the next ten years. Please read my speech (http://bit.ly/1cY4Lo0) and share your ideas.

I also welcomed French water treatment and waste management company Suez Environnement which held a ceremony yesterday to establish their Southeast Asian HQ and R&D Centre in Singapore. They and many other institutions and corporations will be valuable collaborative partners.

This will make contact tracing even more essential but more difficult. I hope those traveling  will keep track of their venues. With modern technology this should not be too difficult. 

The epicenter of the challenge will be our healthcare institutions because patients are most infective when symptomatic. 

But this is also a good reminder to step up public and personal hygiene. Frequent and proper hand washing, careful disposal of tissue paper and litter, and mutual consideration for each other will make a real difference. 

The SARS episode was a terrible time, and I recall losing healthcare colleagues. But I was also inspired and awed by their indomitable sense of duty. 

Whatever happens, we'll get through this together."

30332546206_10152761291976207,"Lively session with Darren Lim & Evelyn Tan, Edmund Wong & Mun Lan at the TOUCH Family Festival. We shared personal insights on what the family means to each of us. 

The first time I held my new born daughter in my arms was the first time I understood unconditional love. I finally appreciated just how much my parents loved me. Parental love flows one way. Parents always love their children more, and pay it forward. 

I finally understood why our pioneer generation worked so hard, sacrificed so much, saved for their children and invested in the future. They would sacrifice everything and do anything, all for the sake of their families. In other words, a society with children and strong families is powerfully focussed on the future. 

This is why families and children are so important for Singapore. These family-centred values, attitudes and perspectives were essential elements for Singapore’s success over the past 5 decades. 

Times are different now, and our children cannot be simply clones of us. They will live in a very different world. But we should be mindful of the core values, principles and attitudes that will always remain relevant.
 
Even as we celebrate #SG50, we look forward to #SG100 – for the sake of our children and grandchildren.

I met new ophthalmology associates from all over the globe and caught up with old friends and colleagues. SNEC celebrates its 25th anniversary - and I still recall the wonderful times as one of the pioneer trainees at its inception. 
 
The advancements in medical technology over the past decades have provided new knowledge, tools and opportunities for health care.  I am encouraged by the innovations that I saw at the conference - such as IBM’s Watson computer which can intelligently assess a patient’s health records for accurate diagnoses and treatment options, da Vinci Surgery’s robot that can perform surgery with gentle precision, and Touch Surgery’s app (which can be downloaded for free) that allows on-the-go access to surgical training whether you’re medical practitioner or not.
 
But there are other areas we can improve on. For example, can we use technology to deliver more cost-effective services? Can we use wearable technology to have a better understanding of our patients? Can we deliver healthcare right to our homes? Can we unlock the human genome to provide more personalised treatment? We must see how we can distil and deploy the best ideas from many disciplines to enable better living and stronger communities for all in a #SmartNation."

30332546206_10152729481431207,"Made 4 points at SIIA’s Dialogue on “Fostering sustainability: What consumer countries can do?”. 

Firstly, consumers should be empowered with accurate information so that we can support companies that are socially and environmentally responsible. We need to close the information gap between consumers and producers. 
 
Secondly, smart technology, including high resolution satellites, digital maps and user generated content can improve transparency. We must hold polluters accountable for negative impact on health of people in the region. This requires political will, comprehensive legislation, international cooperation and determined law enforcement. 
 
Thirdly, NGOs play a crucial role and act as credible and objective third party auditors to give consumers confidence that the products are made responsibly. 

Finally, we need to enlist the help of financial institutions to ensure that the businesses they invest in adopt sustainable practices. 

I hope to see stronger and closer cooperation amongst companies, NGOs, governments, citizens, investors and consumers in this region.

Touching story recounted by his son when he returned a gift that former Minister Howe Yoon Chong had presented to him on his last trip to Singapore in 1993 when he caught a fish in the Singapore River.

""A happily lost wager 

On 21 Dec 1993 Dutch economist Dr. Albert Winsemius lost a wager to Howe Yoon Chong when during a boat trip on the Singapore River he allegedly caught a fish. During his earliest visits to Singapore as the Chief Economic Advisor to the Singapore Government he had recommended to ‘promote’ the heavily polluted River to a formal sewage system by covering it up. While implementing most of his recommendations Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his coworkers adamantly refused to accept this ‘defeat’ and instead promised Dr. Winsemius he would live to catch a fish, showing the River could once again sustain life.
 
During his final visit to Singapore a “Garoupa” (Grouper) was caught on a fishing line. Many, including a laughing Albert himself, felt that a diver had attached the fish to the line making sure that Singapore’s face was saved! The at the time 83-years old Dr. Winsemius, however, said that he never was happier to lose a wager. He was proud to receive from former minister Howe Yoon Chong the Lladró porcelain figurine that symbolizes the transfer of responsibility among generations that is at the core of sustainable development. In 2015 his children returned the fishermen to its rightful ‘owner’, the Singapore Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources."""

30332546206_10152701703771207,"To celebrate SG50, our Fuyong Estate residents are putting together a book to document the rich heritage of the estate.  As part of the book, they are getting past and present residents of the estate to each take a portrait photo, which would then be combined together into a collage of portrait photos, to represent the community of people who have been the life of this estate across the decades.  I was very touched that the residents asked me to join them in their photo-taking.   

For those who may not know, Fuyong Estate is a cozy yet beautiful estate nestled behind Rail Mall.  It was established in 1955 by prominent entrepreneur and philantrophist Mr Lee Kong Chian, who named the estate after his home town.  Mr Lee was moved to provide affordable housing to poor workers who would not otherwise have been able to own their own homes.  He also opened the estate to people of all races. Hence, right from the very beginning, Fuyong Estate has embraced the values of cohesion, compassion and hope. 

During my many walkabouts, I have always been fascinated by the fact that many residents and their extended families have lived here for many decades. Neighbours have become life-long friends, looked out for each other, grown old together and brought up children together. The multi-generational ties have built up a strong sense of community, cohesion and common identity.

Many thanks to the Fuyong Estate residents for putting together this wonderful initiative, to the photographer Mr Edwin Koo for helping to take the wonderful portrait photos and to Ms Gayle Tan for working closely with the Fuyong residents on the content for the book.

Chestnut Ville is a lovely estate nestled inside the Chestnut area.  Residents there have formed a close-knit community over the years, and it was a great pleasure to catch up with them once again.  

In particular, I was pleasantly surprised to find an extended family occupying three houses side – by – side in the estate.  They told me that each branch of the extended family has four children, meaning there are altogether 12 cousins living next door to one another.  What great fun it must have been to have had so many cousins of similar age all growing up at the same time!   

Their children are now in their 20s and 30s, and starting to settle down and to have children of their own.  I was very heartened to hear that a number of them intend to settle down nearby, close to home.  For them and for many of our residents, this neighbourhood is all about families, friends, beautiful memories and building a common future together.

30332546206_10152668155966207,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is going to be the tsunami of the IT revolution, with an estimated 30 billion devices installed by 2020. In contrast, only about 2 billion personal computers and another 2 billion smartphones have been deployed. 

Each IoT device will have a unique ID, and transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

The unit price of each IoT node is falling drastically, and will probably cost less than $1 for the ability to compute, connect, sense and take programmed action. 

This price collapse will fuel the explosion in the number of smart objects with hyper connectivity. As the devices become more energy efficient and rely on solar, wind or piezoelectricity, many nodes may even become energy independent. 

They will generate a huge volume of data. The societies that are best able to do big data analysis and derive deep insights will have a huge advantage, in improving services and achieving competitive advantages. 

On the other hand, those nations who do not prepare now will be face major disruptions and be left behind. There are also major concerns with privacy and security that will need to be addressed. 

In Singapore, we intend to get ahead of the curve. We will invest in having the best cutting edge digital infrastructure. We will enhance the skills and capabilities of our people through education and SkillsFuture so that we can harvest the bountiful opportunities of the future. We will support research and development of new platform technologies through our research institutes, universities, polytechnic and ITE. Singapore will be the ideal test-bed for proof of concept and prototype solutions for the existential future challenges, just as we did for water. 

We believe in and will promote open infrastructure, #openstandards, #opensource and #opendata. This will create a more open society based on trust and collaboration. We will promote innovation by tapping the wisdom of (experts in) the crowd. 

We will pay special attention to safeguarding personal privacy and national security. We will explore how best to roll out a national sensor network and community smart screens that will provide interactive relevant information for residents at the neighborhood level. The key is not technology but to create opportunities for people to interact, build communities and have a higher quality of life. 

We will support the development of solutions in several domains, including home based services, transport, health care, community services, security, logistics and retail. 

Enjoyed the #iotasia conference. Had fun discussing some of my crazy hacks with the ATTiny85 microcontroller, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, nRF24L01, ESP8266 chips. I wanted to show how accessible and cheap all this tech is. We are limited only by our imagination, not money! 

Was excited to see many local companies with great ideas and products, including some like flood sensors which have already been implemented. We must also remain open to new ideas and collaboration with foreign companies with novel ideas. 

So much needs to be done, and we need to work so quickly!

That is the most important legacy Mr Lee has left us and we owe it to him to make sure that these values continue to be the cornerstone of our society for generations to come.

His prosaic answer was to work hard to keep Singapore going. He said it depends especially on the next generation. 

It will be extra painful that SG50 will be the first National Day that he will miss. But so much of what we will celebrate will be because of him and his team. 

He spent his life for Singapore. Every waking thought and dream. Always focused on the future and the next generation. And the only way to repay him now is for all Singaporeans to keep Singapore flying high. We must never let him down."

I believe in #OpenData and #OpenSource tools. They help build credibility and trust in government data and systems, especially when provided in real time. Even more crucial, they allow us to take collective ownership of the challenges confronting our society, and co-create solutions together. This is how we build a more innovative ecosystem, with fertile ground for entrepreneurs and enterprises. Ideas can flourish, compete and combine in novel ways. We can build a more open, transparent society with a right balance between cooperation and competition.

But there are challenges. We need to secure online identities, ensure data security and protect privacy. One concern. How many #OpenSource pioneers are going to become billionaires? It’s not just about money, but to signal the sustainability of this approach.

Education and retraining through #SkillsFuture is vital for us to have the right skills, up-to-date toolsets and knowledge to flourish in the digital economy. Our people need to be owners, creators, makers, designers, programmers, artists, builders and communicators in the new economy. We cannot merely compete to be cheaper, better and faster than robots and smart computer systems. We should build and program the robots, not compete and lose to them. 

We must get ahead of the technological arc or risk stagnation and obsolescence.

It’s going to be an exciting ride as we #buildSG into a #SmartNation. Rest assured of our support for #OpenData and #OpenSource.

Every decade brings with it fresh concerns and challenges which we must always be ready to pre-empt and tackle.

We are also a very small and dense country, therefore we cannot afford to pollute our environment, and must learn to be even more considerate to one another.

• Building another ten new hawker centres by 2027
• New e-waste, food waste and packaging reduction initiatives
• To broaden the scope of NEA’s community volunteers scheme for public cleanliness

30332546206_10152581904001207,"Some young students from Chestnut Drive Secondary School, designing a heritage trail for Bukit Panjang, made me appreciate just how much Bukit Panjang has changed over five decades. They peppered me with many questions.

I told them that the original Bukit Panjang School was located where Junction 10 currently stands. It was a plain, drab single storey structure with a large field. It was also where my parents met, fell in love and started a family. That was why it was such an emotional coincidence for me to be the MP for this area years later. Life does go round in circles.

I also shared with them some childhood memories of this neighbourhood.  Bukit Panjang really was a series of rolling hills with many farms. And there really were dairy farms with real cows along Dairy Farm Road. We used to get fresh cow’s milk delivered every day by a man with a large container on a bicycle. My mother would make us all drink milk every single night. I recall that fresh milk smelt quite different from the pasteurised milk that we find today in supermarkets. You could still smell the cow!  

I also recall hearing frequently dynamite explosions coming from the granite quarries of Bukit Timah Hill. And I recall swimming illegally and dangerously in the cold still waters of the deep pools left behind when the quarries stopped operating years later.

In those days we did not have electronic gadgets, so children would entertain themselves with simpler, but no less entertaining activities like catching fighting spiders or playing hantam bola and football.  

I have many fond memories of Bukit Panjang.  Looking at the Bukit Panjang of today, the physical landscape has changed dramatically. It has been a privilege to have had some part to play in this transformation. Nevertheless, I have never forgotten the essential character of this neighbourhood, and more importantly, the people. I am always cheered to meet residents who proudly recount that they are second or third generation residents of this area. We must not lose that special quality. The closeness to nature, the close ties between families. This neighbourhood should always be about family, friends, memories and a common future in the midst of much progress and change.    

As I looked at the young eager faces of students from Chestnut Drive Secondary, my deepest hope was that they, together with their families and friends, will form their own beautiful memories of Bukit Panjang and forge an even brighter future together."

Our ancestors left their homelands in search of new opportunities, new markets, new products and to provide new services in a rapidly transforming world. This entrepreneurial spirit build modern Singapore. My great grandparents left China and India more than a century ago. I am sure they didn't expect to stay. But they did, just as all the other pioneers of Singapore, and achieved far beyond their dreams.

We are now facing just another tsunami of change due to technology, demographics and the rise of China and India. Singapore will have to find new ways of staying relevant.

I know that our SMEs are facing major headwinds, especially due to the labour shortage. We have to find ways for them to grow, even as the growth of foreign labour slows down. The government is committed to working with our companies and the business associations to make this painful but essential transformation.

30332546206_10152549187626207,"We have hundreds of talented young Singaporeans working in Silicon Valley, California. I was delighted to meet them, feel their energy, and passion as they make their contributions to start-ups and established tech companies. 

I was so proud of them. I encouraged them to pursue all the opportunities that come their way. Succeed, learn as much as they can, build the networks. Also look out for opportunities to grow their enterprises into Singapore as part of a global strategy. 

Singapore is not Silicon Valley. But there are some things we can do faster and better in a small city state with top infrastructure and a single layer of government. We can be an ideal test site for prototypes, or proof of concepts, to be deployed on a national scale. We are an indispensable node for global fibre networks. We are in the heart of a multilingual, multicultural Asia. We can therefore play a role in the global value chain and help fulfill the dreams of our talented Singaporeans. 

Our Smart Nation Initiative will search for greater engagement with them all, including the BATS (Bay Area Tech Singaporeans). Watch this space!"
30332546206_10152543812796207,"We may not be an agrarian society, but the Hindu harvest festival of Pongal holds some useful lessons in life for us.  

First, there can be no harvest without hard work.  As a country, we must always remember that Singapore could not have succeeded if not for the hard work of successive generations of Singaporeans and we must continue to preserve that spirit of hard work and industry.  Second, the harvest is celebrated not alone, but with the family and the community.  Similarly in life, when we do succeed, it is important to remember that it is not only because of our own hard work, but importantly because of the love and support given by our family, friends and the community around us e.g. our teachers.  Finally, even though we can work hard with the best of intentions, devastating occurrences like droughts or floods could ruin the harvest overnight.  Just as in life, unfortunate things can happen to good people and you don’t know when it can happen.  As a society and a community, it’s important to always look out for one another and extend our help to those who are less fortunate.

These were some thoughts I shared when I recently joined in the IRCCares@Cashew cum Pongal Celebration, jointly organised by Cashew IRCC and the Sri Murugan Hill Temple.  

I was delighted to see residents from all races and religions coming together to celebrate and learn more about this meaningful festival.  In the spirit of IRCCares, we also distributed vouchers to beneficiaries from partnering local organisations such as Al-Iman Mosque, Bukit Panjang Methodist Church, Cashew ComCare, Sri Murugan Hill Temple and St Joseph Church (Bukit Timah).  

In particular, I was very pleased to catch up with Xiaojun, who was previously an active volunteer with our Senja-Cashew CC YEC.  She is now a teacher with Chestnut Drive Secondary School and she brought along a group of enthusiastic young students to participate in the event.  I am so happy to see how far she has come in life and that she is now making a difference to lives of many young people."

We agreed on the need for a multi-pronged approach, including vector control, eradication of breeding sites, protection of vulnerable people, public education and vaccination when the vaccines are proven to be safe. We will also have to conduct more trials, share data with the scientists and carefully consider interventions like Wolbachia to reduce the mosquito population.

We have to constantly balance the demands of urbanisation and protection of our natural heritage.

Semakau is our only landfill. And it is filling up rapidly. We have started work on Phase 2 to give ourselves sufficient landfill space for another 20 years. However, before starting work, we discovered a thriving coral system in a lagoon at Semakau. Rather than losing it, we decided to transplant the corals to Sisters Islands. Hopefully they will thrive and establish new coral colonies around these islands. Another fascinating hideout for our natural heritage. I hope to return in years to come and tell the children and grandchildren that we all played a small part in planting a marine garden."

30332546206_10152498292416207,"Presented around 900 Edusave awards this morning. Congratulations to all the students and their families. 

Children are most precious to us. Parents will always be prepared to make great sacrifices for the future of their children. 

I made 3 points in my speech. 

First, that every child is unique, with diverse strengths, interests and passions. That is why our education system has evolved to provide greater choice and flexibility so that every student can maximise his or her potential. There will be many pathways to success.

Second, as we now celebrate SG50, we must commit to making the future even brighter for our children. So much has changed in the last 50 years. Our lives have certainly been transformed. But it is even more important to ensure that our children's lives will also be transformed. Staying still is not an option. Technology and globalization are unstoppable. The pace of change will accelerate. The jobs that our children will pursue will be radically different from ours. And we are likely to have to do more than one job In a single lifetime. 

This means out education system, including adult education will have to enable us to re-skill, re-tool and re-equip us continuously in order to prepare us for new jobs. 

Third, I emphasized the importance of time. Time is the one resource that is always dwindling. Our children need our attention and our time. But they need us for only a temporary phase of their lives. They grow up so quickly. If we miss those early crucial years, then they will not need us so much anymore. And we would have shortchanged ourselves, more than them."

30332546206_10152421684361207,"Transcript of comments delivered during plenary session of AWG ADP COP20 in Lima, Peru, 13 December 2014:

I was privileged to spend more than 8 hours yesterday consulting almost all the ministers  still present at the conference together with Ms Tine Sundtoft, Minister of Climate and Environment of Norway. I would like to share some reflections from the consultation sessions.

First, there was a shared sense of urgency, and consensus on the need to make progress.

Second, there is a need for greater trust in the process and in each other’s perspectives. 

In order to enhance trust, five ingredients are necessary.

First we need to reaffirm the primacy of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Hence the insistence on the phrase  ""Under the convention”. and ""guided by the principles"".

Second, there needs to be a balance in the scope of the INDCs, going beyond just mitigation.

Third, there needs to be assurance of financial support for developing countries, and assurance that there will be no back sliding in commitments by developed countries.

Fourth, there needs to be scaled up ambition, and hence the focus on Workstream 2.

Fifth, we are not prejudging the future legal form of the 2015 agreement or the very contentions issue of differentiation at this point.

We need to get the political balance right. And we need to support President Manuel. I believe some amendments to the text are necessary. I am sure the President will make these changes, but we only have one chance to get it right.

Earlier, some used a surgical metaphor. As an eye surgeon, allow me to extend the metaphor. Before embarking on surgery, the most important question is whether surgery is even needed in the first place. If surgery is needed , the main consideration is the risk of complications. When making surgery, we should use the smallest incision possible.

We should be very careful in making changes to the current text. Only minor surgery is needed.

Let me give another analogy, which I am sure many men can identity with. If you are submitting yourself for circumcision, be very careful that it doesn’t become an amputation! Only minor amendments to the text are needed."
30332546206_10152420941241207,"After protracted, many almost all night negotiations, the United Nations Climate Conference in Lima closed successfully with some last minute minor surgery to the text. 

Peru's Minister for Environment did a great job balancing all the divergent interests and anxieties of the more than 170 countries involved. Great energy and always cheerful. 

He set the stage for all countries to submit 'intended nationally determined  contributions' by the middle of next year to address the impact of climate change. 

This was a complex process involving more than 170 countries with very diverse circumstances. Decisions can only be taken by consensus, not simply a majority vote. Persuasion and relationships matter, almost as much as logic and facts. 

Frankly, I doubt that the initial contributions by all countries will be adequate for solving the enormous problem. But it is a start, and we will hopefully be able to do more, collectively, in the future. 

Thank you to all members of the Singapore negotiating team who spent so many weeks away from home and family to fly our flag. We may come from a tiny country, but we did more than our fair share to facilitate a successful agreement. We have to always work harder, usually quietly behind the scenes, to prove our value and relevance to the world."

They were also able to meet many young people from all over the world who share their commitment and passion for protecting our environment in an uncertain and volatile world. I am always conscious that all the grand global agreements must ultimately make a difference to at an individual level to diverse people all over the world, especially young people who will ultimately inherit the Earth."

The song  also starts off with the pledge recital by children from various races and this will resonate well with Singaporeans as its done for the People by the People. – ‘Heart Beat of the Nation’.

I spoke to the community of makers at the launch of the Singapore Maker Festival 2014 on Friday evening. They are a creative, ‘do-it-yourself’ community of inventors and artists that embody the spirit of risk-taking and experimentation. The same spirit that we need to build a Smart Nation. I encouraged them to continue to tinker and collaborate, and hit us with their best ideas – ideas that can make life better for all Singaporeans. (Transcript: http://tinyurl.com/mdvpl2k)

We want to benefit all citizens, with priority for the needs of three groups:  

First, our seniors, because we do not want a digital divide in our society. Indeed, if applied with thought and care, technology can do so much to improve our seniors’ lives. 

Second, our youths, because they hold the key to the future. We want to give them the skills to be future ready, and the opportunities to shape this future. 

Third, our business owners and entrepreneurs, because they are a vital part of our ecosystem. We want to empower them to use technology and data to create new products and services, and reduce cost.

We are living through a once-in-a-lifetime revolution.
 
Cloud computing, mobile devices, ubiquitous communications and sensors, robotics, 3D manufacturing, big data analytics and social media are causing a revolution in the way we live, learn, work, play, interact and organise our society.
 
These developments present enormous opportunities if we systematically empower ourselves with the new tools, new skills, new institutions and new infrastructure needed for the digital age.  

Societies that are left behind will be in deep trouble, because they will be unable to cope with technological disruptions to our jobs, environment and culture. 

On the other hand, if we do it right we can secure our future, enhance our quality of life, expand opportunities for all and build stronger communities. 
 
The key point is that this is all about people, not machines.
 
PM Lee Hsien Loong has just launched our Smart Nation Initiative. http://bit.ly/1xrtFjk  I am thrilled to have the opportunity to help deliver his vision for our nation. 
 
Smart Nation is not just another Government plan or committee. We can only succeed if the public, private and people sectors co-create the vision and work together to make it happen. Our team will engage ALL stakeholders over coming months.
 
We must answer some important questions together, as a society, as fellow builders of our Smart Nation.  Let me list these questions and also share my initial thoughts.   
 
How do we include everyone in the digital revolution?  This is all about designing solutions for people, and not the other way round.  How do we best do that?
 
How do we develop a sense of collective ownership in building solutions for our nation?  How do we foster an “open source” society, where data, insights and solutions are shared openly to create maximum impact and value?  
 
Where do we look for the best ideas?   What role will local enterprises play?Certainly, we need to engage the best companies in the world. But we will also innovate, develop, prototype and deploy these ideas locally.  This is what we did with water. We didn’t invent reverse osmosis. But we refined, deployed and embedded the technology into our local ecosystem. Today our local firms partner global companies to exploit many opportunities in the global water space. Their calling card is their track record of success in Singapore. This is how we create competitive advantage for ourselves, not necessarily in the whole global value chain but segments of it where we have strategic needs or a head start. 
 
Will we be able to overcome our fear of failure and be prepared to experiment? There will be many failed projects, but we need to learn and persevere in the face of these failures, and not give up in despair. Our attitude to success and failure must change. 
 
What are the pre-requisite skills we must have to thrive in the digital age?  In the past, we all had to learn the 3 ‘R’s - Reading, Writing & Arithmetic. I believe in the future, we will need more than that.  Our people need an Aesthetic sense of beauty & design, the ability to Build, and the ability to Communicate effectively: the “ABCs” of our education system. And all of us will have to pursue life-long re-learning. 
 
What are the physical and technical pre-requisites?  We certainly need world-leading digital infrastructure.  Also, we need security, privacy and protection of identity, as the volume of online transactions and data increases.  Our systems must be secure by design, not a reactive afterthought; and we all as individuals will need to be aware of the risks and know how best to protect ourselves. 

We do not have all the answers.  But I do know that there is so much to be done, and so little time. Join us for the ride of our lifetime. Success is not guaranteed, but it will be exhilarating as we create a working model of the future together - Empowering Everyone Everything Everywhere.

30332546206_10152358943331207,"Water has always been an existential issue for Singapore. 

Edited transcript of a speech I made at the Economists World Water Summit in London on 6 Nov 2014
 
Thank you all for the opportunity to address you. Iam going to make just three points. First, leadership; second, innovation; and third, pricing.
 
First, Singapore is extremely small. You can take Singapore island and put it in Lake Victoria, 69 times, it will still disappear. It is really, really tiny. We are a small island state; one degree north of the Equator. In theory I get lots of water because I get about 2.4 metres of rainfall. But because the land is so small, I cannot capture all the water. And this little barren rock has more than five million people. So, water has been anexistential issue. 
 
Singapore, you would recall, or modern Singapore, arose as a result of the expedition byStamford Raffles who was from the British East India Company. They discovered the deep water harbour, right at the southern tip of the Straits of Malacca. In asense, it was the maritime Silk Road between Europe and Asia. 
 
Next to the harbour was the Singapore River. Basically, over the next century, it became an open sewer. This is a picture going back to the 60s and 70s, and if any one of you came to Singapore, you knew you were near the Singapore River. You did not have to see it, you could smell it. It was an open sewer. 
 
In 1977, the founding Prime Minister of independent Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, set up a challenge. He said “I want this river clean, I want fishing to occur within the river.” He promised the civil servants who cleaned it up that if they could do this in 10 years, he would give them a gold medal. Fortunately, for the civil servants, they did that and by 1987, it was cleaned. 
 
What you see now is what we call Marina Bay. Those of you who have been to Singapore in the lastfive years, you would have been there. The point I want to make is this - an open sewer, converted into a fresh water river. Ultimately, what we have today is a reservoir, a fresh water reservoir and a source of drinking water. If you think about it, what it means is that every drain in your city leads ultimately to the drinkingpipes. 
 
Then you ask: if every drain in the city is going to lead into a cup, what do you need to put in place?Obviously, you need infrastructure, you need organisation, you need rules, you need to clear all the squatters, you need to fix all the sewers which wereinitially laid by the British over a century ago, and make sure none of them leak. You have to relocate pollutiveindustries so that the water becomes clean enough to drink. You also have to reclaim land, and land on which we are now building the new downtown.
 
The point I want to make on leadership is that one of the supreme ironies about the provision of basic sanitation and basic water facilities is that it depends on your apex leadership. For the first forty years of Singapore’s history, as an independent nation, we did not have a Water Minister. In effect, it was the Prime Minister himself. You need that kind of atypicalleadership, in order to have comprehensive, integrated, long term plans and to make it happen. So that is the first learning point from Singapore. 
 
The next point I want to move on to was the need for innovation. About 12 years ago, the percentage of water which we obtained from desalination and from recycling used water was zero per cent. Today, 55 per cent of Singapore’s water needs can theoretically be met through reverse osmosis; that was in 12 years. We did not invent reverse osmosis. Nevertheless, because water was such an existential issue, we had our backs against the wall, and it is a survival issue. PUB, our national water agency spent decades trying to figure this out. 
 
For the first three decades, the only way to desalinate water was flash distillation, but it wasexorbitant and not viable. Reverse osmosis, for the first time, enabled us to produce water, both desalinating from the sea as well as recycling from used water at a viable price. The difference then in Singapore is that we were able to prototype it, upscale it, and create a national solution. 
 
Earlier this year, despite the longest dry spell in nearly 150 years, we did not have to ration water. We continued to be able to supply fresh, good, clean water for all our citizens. The point is that there is a need for innovation; there is a need to translate discoveries from the lab to the tap; there is a need for governments tofund research and development; and there is a need for governments to provide opportunities for prototypingand then upscale these into national solutions. 
 
Today, water in Singapore is really a dependent variable. The key variable is energy. In Singapore now, to produce one cubic metre, one tonne of water requires about 3.5 kilowatts/hour of energy. We are trying to bring it down by half. The only way to do that will be through further innovations, investments, research anddevelopment. But the point is, it can be done. 
 
My final point is on pricing. This is a political issue. As my colleagues have said, many people say: “Water is a human right. It falls from the heavens, and how dare you charge for a human right, for something that falls from heaven?” The brutal truth is that if you want sustainable human rights, and because water is such a precious resource, whether you like it or not, there has to be a price attached to it. 
 
In Singapore, we price water according to the long run marginal cost of the next available drop. The next available drop of water consists of water which we derive either from desalination or from recycling used water. So we do not subsidise water, in fact, we price it at its long run marginal cost, and we have to explain to our population why we need to price water at the price we do.  
 
What is the price, you might ask? The price in Singapore is about one pound sterling for one cubic metre, or one tonne of water. The point I am making here is that it is not cheap, but it is not a huge number either. I daresay that there is no other commodity in the world, which is delivered at your doorstep, in fact, to your bedrooms or bathrooms, at the price of one pound sterling for one tonne. But it is important to get the price right for several reasons. First, it signifies the scarcity value of water. It incentivises conservation. Second, it provides a source of recurrent funds to continue to make the investments, the infrastructure and research and development. 
 
You know, there is one ironic point. In around 1969, the World Bank loaned Singapore $18 million toexpand our sanitation system. But this loan came with a condition.  The condition was that the Singapore Government had to raise tariffs for the treatment of usedwater. In an ironic way, that condition, that imposition of fiscal discipline by the World Bank on Singapore, turnedout to be a very good thing. Because it meant that for the past four decades, we have understood that water is precious; water has to be priced correctly that we will be good for our credit; and we will continue to have money to make investments, infrastructure and research and development.
 
For much of the infrastructure - the reverse osmosis that I have mentioned about, we execute this through Public Private Partnerships (PPP). Not because the Singapore Government is short of funds, but because we wanted the fiscal discipline that comes from the private companies providing basic utility services. If a private company understands that this is a place that has right pricing and is good for its credit, it will also price the provision of these utility services in a sensible way, because it knows this is a low-risk environment.
 

If you price an essential commodity at full market price, you must ensure that even the less well off have access. The way we do it in Singapore is to provide sufficient cash, in the form of rebates, so that less well off families can afford pay for water and electricity at full price. So you still get universal access with fiscal discipline.

So I conclude therefore, by reiterating these three points. You need leadership from the top, you need continued innovation, and you have to have right pricing. If this can be done, as it has been done in Singapore for the past five decades, the challenge for in an urban city is substantially solved. They key issue in the future is price, reliability and security of energy, and the nexus which we can discuss later between food, water and energy."

We need to evolve in order to face the major challenges that the future will bring due to climate change, urbanisation, resource depletion and pollution. But these same challenges also present us with opportunities to build the model city of the future. 
 
Singapore will only be our best home if each and every one of us does our part. We need a sense of personal ownership and collective responsibility. We can realise our vision for A Liveable and Endearing Home, A Vibrant and Sustainable City and An Active and Gracious Community.

By properly disposing of e-waste, we can also avoid having hazardous substances like lead, cadmium and mercury end up in our incineration ash, which gets landfilled at Pulau Semakau and can pose health risks for future generations. 

The real test for the future of e-waste recycling is whether it can move beyond the banner of corporate and social responsibility and generate positive value for consumers and businesses. Today’s collaboration is a good step forward."

30332546206_10152179664196207,"I have always believed that the way an organisation treats its older staff has a profound impact on the loyalty and morale of all staff. Actions speak louder than words. If younger staff see that loyalty and decades of hard work have been recognised, then they, in turn, are more likely to give their best years of their lives to the organisation.

That is why I am delighted that PUB and the Union agreed to extend re-employment up to 67 years. PUB has a relatively large mature workforce, and will have 46 officers who are aged 65 and above this year. These pioneers are a valuable resource to PUB as they have a wealth of experience and knowledge, and are fully capable of contributing to the agency.

This morning, I met Mr  Danabal S/O Kahsairajah who has been working as a Technical Officer with PUB for the past 42 years. He supervises the laying of watermains in the Western part of Singapore.  He was re-hired when he reached 62 years old in 2011. He would have retired in June this year, but he is still fit and able to contribute actively. With PUB raising the re-employment age, he can now continue working. PUB’s re-employment policy makes it possible for officers like Danabal to continue leading an active life while sharing their expertise and experience with younger officers.

I was even more touched that one of Mr Danabal’s sons has also followed his footsteps in joining the PUB.

30332546206_10152103033681207,"A walk down memory lane and the future. 

Took a fascinating walk with the Nature Society and Rail Corridor partnership along our pristine 90 year old Central Pipeline Reserve over the weekend. Many of us have hiked, jogged or cycled along this path for many decades without realizing that it used to convey water from Gunung Pulai in Johor all the way to Pearl's Hill Service Reservoir. Even today, these pipelines are fully functional and essential for supplying water to our city centre. 

We also walked along the Railway Corridor’s most scenic section from Rifle Range Road to Holland Road. The Bukit Timah Railway Station brought back many memories of my childhood. My father used to bring us there after dinner. We would wait for the trains to stop - and occasionally the train driver would let us clamber into his cabin for a few minutes. It was a great thrill. Now that the trains have stopped, I saw many families and friends strolling and cycling - enjoying the greenery and bird life along the way.

I shared our plans to provide additional supply for our downtown, including Marina South and Marina East by laying a 22 km pipe from Murnane Service Reservoir to our city centre. Around 11 km of this pipeline will run underneath the southern part of the Railway Corridor. 

Water has been and will always be an existential strategic issue for Singapore. We need to plan reservoirs, treatment plants and pipelines ahead of demand. Once in place, this essential infrastructure will serve us for many decades.

My initial concern was whether this pipe would disrupt the rail corridor. I agreed to this plan because it not only enhances water resilience, but it is also one way of guaranteeing uninterrupted public access along this corridor for hopefully a century and beyond. Our grandchildren should be able to hike along this pipeline just as we have over the original Pipeline Reserve for 90 years. 

To quote a fellow cycling enthusiast Han Jok Kwang - “This water lifeline will make the land above sacred"".

Actually, we can be more ambitious in our vision - every reservoir should become a community space; every waterway and major pipeline should become a 'Blue Connector’ that will link up with our park connector network in order to provide safe access across our island for pedestrians and cyclists. Imagine being able to walk or cycle from Woodlands to Keppel or from Bukit Timah to Marina Bay along the Bukit Timah Canal without encountering any cars. There will be many hurdles to overcome and it will take years, but I believe it is a worthwhile goal to make our city more livable and endearing at a personal level."

30332546206_10152096698406207,"Thank you to all who shared their suggestions on the Transboundary Haze Pollution Bill. I am glad that there was overwhelming support for the proposed bill and we received much constructive and substantive feedback. I will introduce an amended version of the Bill to Parliament on the 7th of July 2014.

The main challenge in implementing the bill would be in pursuing investigations and gathering evidence. We need effective cooperation with local authorities. I am pleased that the Governor of Riau, Mr Annas Maamun has publicly expressed support for the Bill.  I look forward to working closely with his administration to overcome this common threat to the welfare of our people. 

We also stand ready to help the Indonesian authorities put out the fires, if needed, which I had conveyed in writing to Dr Agung Laksono, Coordinating Minister for People’s Welfare, on 10 June. 

Legislation is not a panacea that will completely resolve the problem of transboundary haze, but it is a step forward to increase pressure on companies to do the right thing. 

In the meantime, I also welcome the efforts of non-government organisations like World Resources Institute, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the WWF to publish concession maps and enhance accountability of the companies in this field.

This is, quite frankly, a long term chronic problem, and we need everyone to do their part in order resolve this once and for all."

30332546206_10151994985291207,"Met some cleaners attending a training session at their worksite this morning. I wanted to get a better sense of the course content and mode of delivery. I was glad that a key focus was on safety, hygiene and the proper use of equipment. Courses are conducted in all official languages, and this particular course was in Malay. The instructor was engaging.

I thanked them all for working so hard and for making time for training. I shared a perspective from my time at SGH when we were dealing with SARS in 2003. In the midst of the crisis, it was crucial to focus on safety precautions for everyone - doctors, nurses, cleaners and patients. We could not afford to neglect training for cleaners or to have substandard cleaning equipment. Because we are all in it together. We have to protect every single person.

This is why I feel so strongly about ensuring that every cleaner is properly trained and equipped. We want them to be safe, and to have progressively better wages and working conditions.

NEA issued the first batch of cleaning licenses to 18 companies today. There are more than a hundred applications that are currently being processed. I would encourage the rest of the companies to do so promptly. 

We will ensure that there are sufficient training places, but I encourage companies to send their workers for training early. We will conduct the training at convenient times and places, including the work sites so that workers don't have to travel. The government heavily subsidises 90% of the costs through grants, and I expect the companies to pay for the balance since they can take advantage of the Skills Development Funds, Productivity and Innovation Credit scheme etc."

President Yudhoyono acknowledged that the 'Riau forest fires were a major disaster'. He committed to the development of a unified map of land use which will help mitigate deforestation. 

I made three points in my speech. 

First, the root of problem is misaligned commercial interests. Companies burn forests for short term profits. 

Second, the main victims are the locals living on adjacent lands. The same companies causing the problem are not being made to pay for the damage they cause to the people most affected. 

Third, there is a urgent need for governments, NGOs and local communities to collaborate, insist on transparency, expedite investigates and prosecute those responsible. Hence the effort by Singapore to draft legislation that will impose criminal and civil liabilities on companies causing transboundary haze."

Desalination and water recyling through reverse osmosis have enhanced our water security considerably over the past decade. However, we are now even more dependent on energy for our water supply.
We need to constantly look out for more sustainable sources of energy. Solar energy is a promising avenue - but Singapore will always be short of land.
So we have decided that PUB commence a pilot project involving floating solar panels in part of the Tengeh Reservoir. We will asssess the impact on our water ecology as we explore alternative cost effective and sustainable sources of energy. 
I am slightly bemused that PUB is returning to electricity generation, albeit in a small way."

The haze began much earlier due to the unusual dry weather from January to March. 

There is a higher probability of this being an El Niño year, with even drier weather in the months ahead. 

We welcomed Indonesia's commitment to expedite ratification of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. 

We renewed our offers of assistance and made some progress in finalizing the MOU on collaboration with Jambi. 

The key sticking point was the unwillingness of some governments to share relevant land use and concession maps. This is an obstacle to full operationalisation of the Haze Monitoring System. 

Frankly, I am disappointed with the lack of transparency. Nevertheless, we have to find a way forward so that errant companies know that governments will exchange information and collaborate to take enforcement action. 

I shared our draft bill on Transboundary Haze with our Indonesian counterparts. I have also asked for the names of companies, and the evidence to be shared with us so that we can take appropriate action against the culprits.

Take a long term perspective - e.g. our water security is the result of many decades of detailed planning and meticulous implementation.
Managing resources carefully and assiduously avoiding pollution
We are all in this together - we breathe the same air, drink the same water, eat at the same hawker centres

Singapore didn’t become a thriving, liveable, clean and green city by chance. We are very fortunate that our founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, was a pragmatic environmentalist way before it became fashionable to be green. He pursued a philosophy of growing our economy while protecting a high quality living environment for the sake of our people. It was not a zero sum game but a virtuous cycle.

We announced plans for ensuring water security, dealing with transboundary haze, updating air quality reporting system, control of dengue, management of hawker centres, upgrading the cleaning industry and the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint.

30332546206_10151887227936207,"February 2014 was the driest month ever in Singapore (since records began in 1869), with only 0.2 mm of rain. 

Yesterday's brief shower not enough to break the dry spell. We still need to improve water conservation. 

See media release from National Environment Agency - NEA and PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency. 

The prolonged dry weather affecting Singapore since mid-January 2014 has set a new record for the driest month since 1869. At the Changi climate station, the rainfall total recorded in February 2014 was 0.2mm, breaking the previous record of 6.3 mm in February 2010. During the month, there were only seven days of short duration showers between 7 and 19 February 2014, mainly in the western parts of Singapore. The rainfall totals across 64 rainfall stations range from 45% to 100% below the long-term average of 161.0mm for February. About half the stations, mostly in the southern and eastern areas, recorded monthly rainfall totals below 10.0mm.

 
2              Apart from being the driest month ever, February 2014 is the most windy month in the last 30 years. At the Changi climate station, the average daily wind speed of 13.3 km/hr recorded in February 2014 exceeds the previous high of 12.5 km/hr in January 1985. The prolonged dry conditions have also set a new record for the lowest average daily relative humidity of 74.5%. The previous record low for February and any month of the year was 76.9% (February 1968) and 74.6% (June 2013) respectively. 
 
3              The last day of significant rainfall was on 16 February 2014, when between 0.2 and 29.0 mm was recorded in various parts of the island. Since then, there has been little or no rainfall, with Singapore entering another period of dry spell on 17 February 2014. This follows the 27-day long dry spell between 13 January and 8 February 2014. The highest recorded rainfall total since 17 February 2014 was 19.2mm at Lim Chu Kang Road. The brief showers yesterday which brought limited rainfall of between 0.2 and 15.2 mm in some parts of western Singapore were not widespread enough to break the current dry spell.
 
4              The dry weather affecting Singapore and the surrounding region is expected to persist in the first half of March 2014. There may be localised showers in the afternoon on a few days, and rainfall is expected to be well below average. Fair and warm conditions are forecast for Singapore.  The prevailing northeasterly winds are also forecast to remain steady over this period. With the expected onset of the Inter-Monsoon in the second half of March 2014, the winds in the region will turn light and variable in direction. Increased rainfall can be expected in the later part of the month.
 
5             With the dry weather expected to continue, PUB, the National Water Agency (PUB) has started a public campaign to get everyone to conserve water. For example PUB has sent circulars to 25,000 non-domestic customers – including the town councils, Management Corporation Strata Title (MCSTs), commercial and industrial buildings, government buildings and schools – to advise them to make adjustments and embark on water-saving measures. Measures like cutting down the washing of cars and irrigation of plants, as well as switching off water features/fountains will help reduce water usage.
 
6              Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company Pte Ltd (SSMC) has cut down on the irrigation of plants and installed all taps in the toilets with water thimbles. “Collectively as a company, I am glad that our Water Efficient Building management has prepared us well to cope with this dry season. In a dry spell situation like now, we are motivated in putting even more efforts to conserve water. At our facility, watering of trees and plants are done in a sparing manner. All our taps in toilet are installed with water thimbles. Individually, on personal level, we also we encourage our staff to do less frequent car wash, use water wisely at home,” said Jagadish CV, CEO of SSMC.
  
7             The public can also save water by taking showers under five minutes, washing clothes on a full load and reusing water for non-potable uses. They can also cut down on non-essential water consumption like the washing of cars and irrigation of plants. The amount of water we save will help stretch our limited water resources longer.
 
8             The National Environment Agency (NEA) and PUB will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary. For updates, visit the NEA website (www.nea.gov.sg) or follow us on NEA Facebook (www.facebook.com/NEASingapore) and NEA Twitter (@NEAsg).

30332546206_10151865214916207,"We have drafted new legislation that will impose criminal and civil liabilities on errant companies that cause or contribute to transboundary haze in Singapore.
 
Transboundary haze has recurred for too many years in our region. The worst episode occurred last year, and there are early signs of a recurrence this year.
 
The root cause is commercial. It is not the weather or the environment.  Errant companies have been clearing land by illegal burning because it is the cheapest way to do so. Although there are domestic laws against this practice, there are real problems in investigation and enforcement in those countries.
 
We need to go further. We have therefore decided to draft new legislation with extra-territorial application. If approved by Parliament, errant companies - local or foreign, will face criminal charges in Singapore courts if their overseas actions cause haze pollution in Singapore.
 
The proposed laws also provide for civil liability. Singaporeans may sue these errant companies for personal injuries, damage to their property, or other losses as a result of the transboundary haze.
 
We hope this legislation will send a strong signal of deterrence to such errant companies.
 
Before we introduce this Bill in Parliament, we would like to open this for public consultation. Please go to

We been experiencing a unusually dry phase of the Northeast Monsoon since mid-January. The Northeast Monsoon typically lasts until early March. Actually, similar dry periods have occurred before - most recently in early 2010. Global climate change means greater weather volatility - with increased chances of both more intense storms and unpredictable periods of drought. 
 
PUB has been running our desalination and NEWater plants at close to full capacity. Our two desalination plants have a combined output of 100 million gallons per day (mgd) and can meet 25% of our water needs. Over the last two weeks, PUB has also injected an additional 20 to 25 mgd of NEWater into the reservoirs for indirect potable use, and this amount will be increased to about 30mgd next week. Our objective is to keep our water reserves in the reservoirs at healthy levels.
 
Fortunately, our major investments in NEWater and desalination over the years have diversified our sources of water supply and strengthened our water security. 
 
Although we can be confident of meeting our water needs, let us remember that every drop of water is precious.  Do continue to practise good water-saving habits and avoid unnecessary consumption. We can make every drop count.  Please check out http://www.pub.gov.sg/CONSERVE/HOUSEHOLDS/Pages/Watersavinghabits.aspx for water conservation tips."

All of us would have witnessed or may have even been caught in the recent flash floods. The intense rainfall, especially in low lying areas, has overwhelmed the local drainage systems in these areas. 
 
We know where all these areas are, and PUB has been working hard on plans to improve their drainage capacity. I have asked PUB to expedite the ongoing work on 170 projects and to commence work on 36 new projects within 12 months (see map below). 

The drainage project at Chai Chee Road has been brought forward from mid-2014 to early 2014. Road raising will commence this weekend. 

Major canals like Alexandra Canal and Rochor Canal are being widened and deepened. Some works will be completed by next year but others will take longer. Interim measures will be implemented in the short term, especially focused on ensuring that our roads remain passable despite heavy storms. 
 
These island wide accelerated projects will cause some inevitable inconvenience. I hope Singaporeans will understand the need to do so, and support PUB's efforts to future proof our drainage system. 

As wetter weather sets in with the year-end monsoon, PUB has also stepped up checks on construction sites, drain maintenance, and its staff and contractors are on standby 24/7.
 
When flash floods occur, do exercise caution and let's also look out for one another. Stay updated by going to PUB's Facebook, Twitter or MyWaters app.
 
If you notice any other drainage problems in your neighbourhood, please don't hesitate to let us know.

In many countries, untreated used water is discharged from sewers directly into drains and water bodies – thus contaminating precious water resources and drinking water sources.  Protecting our environment from untreated used water is therefore as important as meeting our water needs. 
 
SPRING Singapore and PUB have awarded seven local enterprises a total of $2.5 million to develop innovative technologies for both industrial and domestic used water treatment. (Press release at http://www.pub.gov.sg/mpublications/Pages/PressReleases.aspx?ItemId=386)
 
One such technology involves an electrochemical treatment solution (see picture) that can recover oily substances from food waste, to be developed by Envirotech and Consultancy. The concentrated grease can be used for biodiesel production as well.
 
We need such new used water technologies to be developed to enhance the quality and efficiency of used water treatment processes, to reduce industrial water consumption and ensure that stringent water discharge standards in Singapore can be met.  
 
Having the opportunity to test-bed innovations in Singapore will enhance our water technology companies’ capabilities and allow them to be applied in future water reclamation efforts, which potentially accelerates their commercial development.

30332546206_10151546893256207,"Thrilled to meet Steve Wozniak - and to discuss why Singapore needs to quickly build a critical mass of engineers, artists and angel investors. 

We spoke at the Midas Touch Asia 2013 Enterprise Award ceremony on 26 August.

Edited excerpts of my speech - on Singapore's prospects for making an impact on the ICT revolution.

In 1982, my father bought my first computer - it was an Apple II Plus. Many of you here are too young to have used that venerable piece of technology. 

I was a medical undergraduate, and my father had to take a loan to buy it.  The cost then was a lot more than what one would pay for its equivalent today. I recollect the thrill of unpacking it, assembling it, and taking off the lid. I was telling Steve just now, I also remember putting in a Z-80 in order to run the CP/M operating system.

I was a very poor gamer. In fact, I was forced to learn programming in order to hack the games. I learnt Integer BASIC and I just discovered that Steve was the one who wrote Integer BASIC. He told me just now how he wrote it by hand and then transcribed it into the binary code which actually ran on the computer.  

The purpose of sharing all this with you is for us to reflect that in over 30 years, our lives have been completely transformed. We pay progressively lower prices for ever more powerful technology. I experienced for myself the computer revolution in the medical and surgical fields. 

Today computers around us can operate at levels of precision, far beyond the ability of my eyes and hands. For instance, for those of you who gone for refractive surgery - I know Steve himself has gone for this, computer-controlled lasers operate at the level of one-quarter of one-thousandth of a millimetre. No human surgeon can achieve that level of precision unaided, but computers have transformed what we can do with our hands and our eyes. 

Of course, beyond the medical field, computers have also revolutionised the finance and technical fields. It has been a source of great opportunity. But let me give you a political angle to this. It has also been a source of great inequality. 

Stop for a moment to think about it. The advent of new technology can lead to different outcomes for people in different circumstances. For example, who gets to borrow the money to access the new technology? Who gets educated on how to use the technology? And who are the people who will devise new uses for technology, which the original creators never dreamt of?

So the point is - although politicians may aim for equality of opportunities, the ability to exploit these opportunities can very often be very unequally distributed. It depends on where you are born; whether you live in a society which has access to technology; whether you have the initial funding to buy or to rent the technology; and whether the education system equips you with the necessary skills to do all these wonderful things. So this has been both a great opportunity and also a cause for inequality. 

Another reason I wanted to be here is because I was very intrigued by Steve Wozniak’s view - I think in December 2011 or 2012 - when he said that a company like Apple could never emerge from Singapore. I didn’t have enough time to discuss this in detail with him. 

But I wanted to share a couple of points. The first thing I wanted to tell Steve is that in Singapore, you can say anything you like. Steve Wozniak, in particular, is a friend of Singapore - your advice is sincere, and you are actually trying to help us. So contrary to popular belief, we are not going to structure your thoughts or your conversations. Thank you for being brutally frank. 

Now, having said that, I also want to say that I do not totally agree with Steve. And let me explain why. First, Singapore only began on this journey 30 years ago. Steve and the people like him embarked on this journey a generation before us. We are late-comers to the party. 

The second point is that I believe we need a critical mass of three groups of people if we are to make a significant contribution to this space. We need engineers, artists, and angels (- angel investors). 

Let me explain. I visited Google in Mountain View a couple of times. Each time I went there, I asked to meet Singaporeans. And I remembered meeting 20 to 30 Singaporeans. And they told me: they are really happy working at Google, and I asked why. And they said: “because this is a company that values engineers. And as engineers, we can change the world”. It is not about getting fabulously rich. But it is that empowering sense that ""we can change the world"". They were thrilled to have that opportunity to work in teams producing new products and services that could change the world. So we certainly need engineers.

The second group is artists. I use artists in the most liberal sense of word. Just now when I was having a chat with Steve, and he explained the key advantage of the other Steve. Steve Jobs was not as technically gifted as Steve Wozniak. Steve Wozniak would design the chips, the motherboard and did the programming. Maybe because Steve Jobs did not have that same gritty, down-in-the-chips knowledge - his mind was focused on design, packaging, branding; on making technology sexy and available to non-engineers. 

The point I wanted to share with you is it is not enough to just have the engineers who can change the world - you need people who can humanise technology; make people desire that technology; and to want to identify with it and to want to use it. And that is why the whole concept of design is crucial. I think design is really about creating a language that speaks to the human heart and soul. And we need people like that as well.

The third group of people we need are Angels - Angel investors. Frankly, especially in Asia and in Singapore, we are not short of money. But what we need is smart money. People who are willing to invest in companies but who also know enough about technology and design. To give good, honest brutal advice, the same way that Steve Wozniak has given good honest brutal advice to Singapore. People who can put their money where their mouth is, exercise their minds, and to truly nurture and build up entrepreneurs. The way I look at it, we have not yet fully taken off in Singapore. We can, and I hope we will build up that critical mass of engineers, artists and angels. 

For now, our objective in Singapore is to remain one of the world’s most open cities. Because ideas can only be generated in human minds. Only human minds imagine the future. And we need to make sure we get more than our fair share of the dreamers and visionaries of the world. If not to live here permanently, then at least to spend a significant amount of time - exchanging ideas, and building up our idea pool. 

The second point is for Singapore to remain one of the most connected nodes of the world. It is not an accident that we have one of the most dense fibre networks in Singapore. I am not just referring to the fibre that goes into every home. But I am referring to the fact that we are a focal node of the fibres that traverse the globe. That is not very sexy - just fibre optics. But it represents our strategy to be a focal node of an inter-connected world. Because we believe that being an exchange, a focal point for ideas, data and information, will make us part of a larger network and give us access to the critical mass of engineers, artists and angel investors. 

My final point is that we cannot be everything to everybody. The truth is, it is practically impossible for us to be a clone of Silicon Valley. The history, the skills, the climate, the academics, and the engineering expertise in Silicon Valley is not something we can transplant anywhere in the world. Anyone who says that “I’m creating a silicon valley” is probably overreaching. 

But I believe, we should be comfortable with ourselves, by being a secure, beautiful and wonderful place to live, travel, and settle in. A place where you are happy to bring your wife to. A place where your kids can grow up to be educated, and not have to worry about guns and drugs. A place where your parents can get good healthcare. A place where you can meet secure, reliable and honest bankers. A place where you can meet other people with ideas. The point I am trying to make is that an open, secure, comfortable, family-oriented, and welcoming place, is also a core part of our strategy. 

Let me conclude by congratulating all the winners. I have known people like George Quek and Derek Goh for many years. They are also part of the proof that Singaporeans can make it, with imagination and with determination. Because Singapore is so small, all of them had had to go beyond the boundaries of Singapore. 

There are other examples like Sim Wong Hoo of Creative Technology and what he has done for the sound card. You think about the USB Thumb Drive invented by Henn Tan and his engineers at Trek2000 in Singapore. The point I am trying to leave with you is that we do have our own local heroes.  But what we need to do now is to urgently build up the critical mass of local heroes who will be entrepreneurs of the world using Singapore as their home base. 

I hope I have given you enough food for thought. And I hope  to persuade Steve Wozniak in my own way, ""don’t count us out yet"". We heard you and we will dearly love to prove you wrong sometime in the future. 

Thank you all very much."

30332546206_10151497396186207,"Your job, politics, position - everything is temporary. The only thing that you are forever, is a son, a brother, a husband, a father, a grandfather.

Edited excerpts from an interview with Elgin Toh of The Straits Times published at http://www.singapolitics.sg/supperclub

I shared my views on the importance of family, ideals, values, cabinet responsibility and civil political discourse.


(Why did you choose this place - Senja-Cashew Community Club - to meet for supper?)

This place has special significance. Back in 2006, we decided to build a pool in Bukit Panjang. However, it was supposed to be in another location further south.
My first post-election block visit was to a block opposite here. At the end of the visit, the grassroots leaders went to the top, looked down, saw this pond (by the current location of Senja-Cashew CC), and said, “Actually, the pond is the centre of the town. So, instead of building the pool in the original site, let's build it here.”
Immediately, there were several problems. First, you've already announced building it at another place. You shift it. Some people are going to be unhappy. So I said, well, my next block visit then has to be to the other block, to explain to them: I know the pool is not at your doorstep, but, really, if you take the bigger picture, this is a better site because everyone will benefit. So there is a political point there that sometimes, you have to make decisions where some people will be unhappy, though actually it is for the good of the majority.
 
(You have supper here often?)
I'm here every week, more than once a week. My Meet-The-People session is not far away, so I come here, hang out and meet people.
 
(But at home? Somebody cooks?)
Yes.  A combination of my wife or the helper cooking. Probably one-third of our meals are actually from Ghim Moh Market and Hawker Centre.

(You stay not far from there?)
Yes, I live in my own constituency. The standard stuff which we get from there would be the mee pok, chicken rice, char kway teow. But char kway teow is hard to get, because always the long queue. And then the tao huay. I suspect this is probably quite a common phenomenon in Singapore - eating takeaway local food regularly. Which illustrates the importance of hawker food and hawker centres in the lives of Singaporeans. 
That is why one of the first things I did when I came to the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources was to revise the policy on building hawker centres. We had not built any for nearly 20 years. I persuaded my colleagues that hawker centres are a unique identifying mark of Singaporean society. More families like mine are actually depending on it even for staple food. It's part of the local community because, especially for hawkers who have been there for a long time, you know them, they know you, you've grown up with them, that sense of social bonding is there.
And even more important than that, it's a place where all Singaporeans gather. You go to Ghim Moh, literally, you meet all kinds of people - from those in shirts and ties to those in shorts and t-shirts and slippers. It is a place where social distances are erased. So hawker centres are a key part of our social infrastructure. After we said we were going to build, we also removed the minimum rent. Because I want to bring rentals down and to put pressure even on coffee shops and kopitiams, to bring rentals down. 

(But there is still upward pressure on the price of hawker food. The latest survey shows prices are still going up.)
That's because our new hawker centres haven't come on stream yet. And I announced 10. But you know where I actually want to go. So I'm basically putting people on notice that this is a service, and we're going to make it widely available.
 
(It has been a fairly busy year for you so far, with your ministry having to deal with one crisis after another - dengue, haze and hawker centre cleaning. Some would call this a perfect storm.)
Flooding hasn't occurred yet.  Then we would have a perfect storm!

(What does it feel like to be under pressure like this?)
I must confess to being quite energised by crisis. I enjoy the challenge of being under pressure. Maybe to some extent, it is due to my medical and surgical experience. There's no such thing as a routine operation. Every single operation, even if you have done it thousands of times, has a risk of failure. Every surgeon, mentally before he starts, has already considered, or should have considered, all the complications and the failures. 
So, to be honest with you even if I look at this year's events, dengue - we are overdue for an epidemic. Our last epidemic was in 2005 and 2007, and if you check my comments, over the last two years I've been saying, it's going to happen, it's going to happen. In fact, every year that we don't have a dengue epidemic, we are storing up the pressure for an epidemic the following year, especially if there is a switch of viral serotype. So did dengue surprise me? No.
Haze has been around for at least two decades. I knew full well that this was not an environmental problem, it was an economic problem. Because the economic incentives skew people's behaviour in the wrong direction. Of course, I cannot predict the wind. So did I expect it to be so bad? No I did not. But did I anticipate that haze will hit us? Yes.
Hawker centres -  well, I did not expect the Workers' Party to treat the hawkers so shabbily. That one I admit I did not anticipate. But I guess what I'm trying to say is that, from a surgical perspective, you always mentally prepare, and when things go wrong, that is the difference.
I put things in perspective because this is not the worst that I have faced or the worst that I will face. The most harrowing period in my last 12 years in politics is not this year. It was those two months in 2003 when (as part of the Ministerial Sars Combat Unit) I was tasked to go to SGH (Singapore General Hospital), put on a mask and help restore confidence and resolve the problems there.
I spent two months at the hospital, attending Cabinet meetings through video conference, and having a colleague - Dr Alex Chao - die. Can you imagine every day we met in the morning, sitting around the table wearing masks, and if one of us has a fever, he was whisked off to Tan Tock Seng hospital? So you're wondering, when's your turn? And during those two months, I slept in a separate room because I didn't want to risk infecting my wife or my children. 

(What do you make of the reaction of the public to the haze and dengue crises?)
Frankly, each time we've gone through a crisis, I've emerged more confident about Singaporeans. Let me explain why. During SARS, I watched medical professionals put their lives on the line. We were dealing with a disease that we didn't understand. We didn't know the level of risk. Every doctor, every nurse showed up for work. They walked into danger, not out of it. No panic. Just this deeply held sense of duty. You look even subsequently at dengue and at the haze. I've been impressed by how Singaporeans are calm, collected, looking out for each other and cohesive. And practical in a sensible way in the midst of challenges, which I think in many other societies would have led to either panic or rupture, and we haven't. Of course there are things which we may not have done perfectly, and there will be people who complain. But actually you step back and look at it, there's good reason to be confident about Singaporeans. It has strengthened my belief in Singapore's and Singaporeans' ability to cope with the future.

(What do you make of the reaction of the public to the hawker centre cleaning saga?)
Just one point. Prime Minister (Lee Hsien Loong), in fact the entire Cabinet, including me, wanted to affirm that integrity is sacrosanct in our political system. That is the key point. 

(What do you do for fun, or to relax?)
For fun, I assemble computers, I programme, I learn new languages to programme. And because I don't get to operate on eyes anymore, my latest thing is to assemble watches because I get to wear magnifiers and work with very fine tools. So I can take a watch and fix it for you.

(When did this watch hobby start?)
About a year and a half ago.
(How did you learn to do it?)
On the Internet, you can learn all that and then you go and buy all the equipment, buy the pieces. So, I can quite literally fix an automatic or even a quartz watch for you, including fitting the hands and painting the luminous parts.

(And computers?)
That's decades ago. I was one of the early adopters in computers - since the 1980s. So I assemble it, I fix it, I even crimp network cables. I used to do some programming while I was working at a hospital. So in a way, now, I do so just to stretch the mind intellectually in a non-political direction. And for watches it is to keep my hand-eye coordination, because I don't get to operate anymore. But again, the problem is time.

(What books are you reading? 
The current books I'm reading - Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder, by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who also wrote The Black Swan. This is his latest book, and it is relevant to Singapore. Another good author whom I've been following is Michael Sandel, the philosopher who wrote Justice. The more recent book which I thought was interesting is What Money Can't Buy, which is relevant for us in Singapore as well. So that's politics. Science - I'm still trying to wrap my head around relativity and Albert Einstein. Then there is some economics. And I have a whole host of other books on programming. From C to Python to Lisp. So I'm quite indiscriminate. 
 
(You entered politics in 2001. Can you tell us about the journey that you've taken over the past 12 years. Has anything about you changed?)
I was recruited by the former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. And I never forgot his key message to me when he was encouraging me to come in. He said: ""You must hold fast to your values. If you have to compromise your values in order to join us, you lose your value to us."" Over the years, I have never forgotten that. And I think it's the best advice you can give to any politician coming in.
He added: ""You come in. It doesn't matter if your beliefs or views are different from us. If you can convince us, we will make changes. But on the other hand, if we show you that this is the right thing to do, you must be intellectually honest enough to admit it.""
And looking back, these have been some of the most dramatic 12 years in terms of the assortment of crises, ups and downs, and social and political changes that have occurred in Singapore. So it's been a fascinating journey.

(So how much was there of you convincing them, and how much was it them convincing you?)
I don't think I can quantify. You must appreciate how seriously we take collective responsibility in the Cabinet. Collective responsibility doesn't mean all Ministers agree on everything. But it requires us, after we have argued it and arrived at a decision, to collectively bind ourselves to that decision, to defend it, implement it and to make it happen. That is what Cabinet government means. Because, whether it's transport or housing or environment or education, you can't just let the minister go out there on his own. All of us have to stand by the policies.
So the discipline of collective responsibility forces us to think and argue far more intensely before the decision is made than after that. It causes a very detailed deliberative process.  The discussions are rigorous and intellectually challenging..
The other point is that we're not a bunch of chums. We are all brought in as part of a team that is  focused on the country and the long term interests of Singaporeans. So there is no “I told you so”, no one-upmanship, no cliques or factions in Cabinet. Anyone that we felt was playing games would not survive Cabinet. So it leads to a very intense, but also a very objective decision-making process. I think that is one of the secrets of the government's success over these decades.

(In 2011, former minister Lim Boon Heng broke down when he was talking about Cabinet deliberations on the casinos. It was a sign that such collective responsibility can bear very heavily on the individual, isn't it?)
Yes.

(Does it come to a point where it could weigh on your conscience? Has there been such a point for you?)
There are individual decisions which I would have made differently, but I have never been put in a position where my conscience was on the line.

(And if that point comes?)
If that point comes, the Minister has to, first, do his best to persuade his colleagues.

(Failing which?)
Failing which, if it is really such a fundamental point of conscience, then he should ask to step down from Cabinet. That too is part of Cabinet government. But a fundamental point, a difficult point, a controversial point and a divergent point are different points on the scale. 
You pointed out how former minister Lim Boon Heng broke down in 2011 when he was talking about Cabinet deliberations on the casinos. You have seen emotional anguish showing through. But you will not see a minister step out of line. At least not the ministers I know, past and present.

(You said former PM Goh told you to hold fast to your values. What were these values for you?)
For me, it's really about the family. On both my father's and mother's side, I'm a fourth generation Singaporean. My great grandparents came from China and India to Singapore. And I believe in a multiracial society. This is a deeply held belief, because my existence depends on a multiracial society.
Secondly - and this may not be a popular word right now - meritocracy is a very deeply held belief. 85 years ago, my mother's father passed away on a business trip to China, leaving my grandmother one month away from delivering my mum. So my mum never met her father. And immediately, from what was actually a reasonably comfortable living as a motor car spare parts dealer, her world collapsed. And they became dependent on the generosity of my grandfather's brothers.
Later on, both my parents became teachers. And we've seen social mobility - each generation having a fair chance to move up. That's what I define meritocracy as. That also is a very deeply held belief. 
The third thing is probably is a hangover from my mother. Because she had a deprived childhood, I've inherited her sense of austerity. 
And I suppose the other element which I've come to appreciate even more over the past 12 years is that absolute necessity for honest government grounded in integrity. I've now travelled to so many countries. What we've done in Singapore - it's not as if we have a copyright of the ideas. But the ability to execute so many things in Singapore is because we had an honest government which has enjoyed the trust of the people.
 
(Right. But when you entered politics, you also said you had been sceptical of the PAP. So which were your points of disagreement?)
In 1984, I published my first letter to the Forum Page. I was against the graduate mothers' scheme. I felt it was elitist and it didn't show respect. After all, my mum was not a graduate. There were other issues. I remember once barging into Mr S Rajaratnam's house. He stayed on Chancery Lane, not far from where I stayed. He may have retired from politics then. I knocked on his gate, he let me in, spent an hour, I was nobody, I was just a medical student. I remember that I was not happy with something about race, language and religion, that we were accentuating it. Later on, I had also voiced public opposition to linking votes and upgrading. That was probably in the 1990s.
So there were specific issues which I had disagreements with. But during the discussions with (then) PM Goh and subsequently in interviews with (former prime minister) Lee Kuan Yew and (then Deputy PM) Lee Hsien Loong, I was impressed that the PAP does not screen your views. What they want to find out is whether you have values. And that you can marshall the arguments in support of a view that is honest, genuine, and sincerely held. The PAP is not afraid of differences of opinion. What the PAP does not want are charlatans. We want people who are grounded.

(What would you say to a young person today who, like you in the past, may be sceptical of the PAP?)
I'll say the same thing that (then) PM Goh said to me. Hold fast to your values and express your views, sincerely, honestly. And think deeply, don't just posture, don't just play to the gallery, don't just think short-term. If you can go beyond all that, I hope you make yourself available and be part of a party or a movement that has focused entirely on the long-term interests of the nation. 
(Why the PAP and not the opposition?)
Because I would say that this is an honest party. This is a party which is also a broad church, meaning we will never tell you what to say, but we will ask you to be honest. Secondly, this is a party that has made things happen, can make things happen. So be a part of it. Change is inevitable, but we want change that is principled, change that will make this fragile, beautiful flower called Singapore continue to thrive in a very dangerous uncertain world.
Many people have said the PAP is just concerned about money. But I've often told people who say that that, let's take a step back in time. Let’s look back. The PAP fought for Merdeka - independence - because it was about our right to determine our future. That led us to Malaysia. Then in Malaysia, we championed a Malaysian Malaysia. This is actually a code word for equality regardless of race, language or religion. And we got kicked out of Malaysia because of our insistence on that ideal. We didn't get kicked out of Malaysia because we thought it was good for the economy. In fact it was bad for the economy. But having got kicked out of Malaysia because of this obstinate adherence to an ideal, we then had our backs against the wall. And we had to survive and thrive in order to feed ourselves.
So yes, we were then focused on economic growth but it was done because we had no choice. It was done because of our obstinate belief in this ideal that we could create a fair and just society, where we would all be equal regardless of race, language or religion.
Over four, five decades, this has actually been an idealistic quest by the PAP.  So if I can come back to why I would want someone to join: this is a party rooted in ideals, rooted in history, and with a proven track record and consisting of honest people, not bound by ties of cronyism, but purely by a passionate desire to make this country continue to grow and thrive in an uncertain, sometimes unfriendly world. So be a part of it.
That doesn't mean the opposition has no role. Mr Lee (Kuan Yew) used to tell us that the years that the PAP had a monopoly, which is I think from 1968 to 1981, were not pre-ordained. It was basically due to a strategic mistake of the Barisan Sosialis to walk out of Parliament. There has and there will always be a significant body of opinion that is different from the PAP. We are a democracy and there should be a legitimate expression of that divergence.

(Although, some people would say, yes, it was a strategic mistake by the Barisan Sosialis, but many from the opposition were also put behind bars.)
(Former Barisan Sosialis leader) Lee Siew-Choh never went behind bars. The guy whom I knew who went behind bars, whom I knew personally, was Dr Lim Hock Siew. He's passed away now. But I've known him for a very long time, spoken to him in depth. He was, I believe, a patriot. And I have said that he was a good and honourable man. I still stand by those comments. In fact before I came into politics, I called him to ask him what he thought about me joining the PAP. He told me: ""Do what you believe is right."" The sense he gave me was not to fight yesterday's battles. Singapore has changed, Singapore has moved on. He bore no bitterness to the second and third generation leaders. At the same time it was also a salutary lesson of the price of politics. Politics is not just a game. It's not just cricket. There are real lives at stake. He paid a very heavy price.

(You knew him very well. You knew his story. Do you believe he was unjustly put behind bars?)
He could have got out earlier if he renounced communism. Till this day, I do not know whether he was a member of the communist party. He's never told me categorically. But I've interacted and discussed and argued with him enough to know that he's on the hard left. When I was interviewed (as a candidate) by Mr Lee (Kuan Yew), and in the interview I told him I'd known Dr Lim for a long time, he just had one sentence to say: ""Singapore would be very different if his group had been in charge."" And honestly, I think we all have to admit that it would have been very different if the extreme left wing of the PAP had been in charge instead of Mr Lee's group.

(You recently posted a picture of you sending your son to school. Is that what you do every day?)
Yes. So last night I had a Meet-The-People session. By the time I got home it was past 1am. So I slept at about 2.30am. At 6am, he woke up demanding his drink, I had to give him. And at 7am I sent him to school. For 25 years, I've done all the night feeds, I've done all the nappy changes, and I've sent all four children to school. I did it partly because I don't need so much sleep. As a doctor, I can cope with interrupted sleep, I can cope with short sleep. So I told my wife, all the night duties are mine. And sending them to school. Why do I do that? Because it meant, the last thing and the first thing my children saw each day was me. So no matter how busy I have been, all my four children know how much they mean to me. So when I talk about family, it's not an idle boast. I will tell you quite honestly, I'm a very happy person. I'm very happy not because I'm easily entertained or easily satisfied. I'm very happy because of my family. And we should realise that everything else will pass: your job, politics, position - everything is temporary. The only thing that you are forever, is a son, a brother, a husband, a father, a grandfather.

(How old are your children?)
My eldest is 24, a daughter. I have a son who's 23, another son who's 20, doing National Service, and I've got this 7-year-old.

(That's quite a gap, between the youngest and the other three.)
They are an enormous source of happiness.  Waking up at night, cleaning, changing and sending them to school are merely expressions of that profound part of my life that they represent. 

(What do your children think of your job as a minister?)
The 7-year-old, I'm not sure if he fully understands. But for the other three, they're all grown up. They have paid a price. So I would say politics imposes a heavy burden not only on the individual but on the entire family.

(What kind of price?)
The loss of privacy, the loss of family time and the pressure to always behave correctly. And that's why we all understand that when someone says yes to politics, actually it's his or her family that's going to carry the burden too.

(How do your children deal with the nastiness on the Internet directed at you?)
They've grown up. They understand that this is the way it is. It is an unfortunate coarsening of discourse on the Internet, to a large extent because it is either anonymous or it is faceless. If people met face to face, eyeball to eyeball, certain human courtesies apply. But for some reason, behind the keyboard, people lose the safety circuits of decent human interactions.

(So you don't think this is a phase?)
I think it can only get worse. In the old days, we were limited by the number of people we could physically meet within a geographical area. With the Internet, no matter how extreme your idea is, you can always find someone equally or more extreme than you to affirm you. You can be egged on, whichever way.
It's unfortunate because it will make governance and leadership far more challenging in the future. So I think the politicians of the future will just have to learn to cope with it. For the current Cabinet, we do not look for gratitude or affirmation. We want to do the right thing and do it for the right reasons and for the long term. That's the only thing worthwhile doing. We are confident we will carry the ground if we did right and served honourably. So that's the attitude that we have and how we operate."

Update from NEA: The number of hotspots in Sumatra has gone up sharply in the last 2 days to reach 159 yesterday. Of these hotspots, 63 are detected in the Riau province in central Sumatra, which is about 280 km from Singapore. Some localised smoke plumes are observed to emanate from the hotspots.   The other hotspots on the island are primarily further north, in Aceh and North Sumatra. As the winds are currently from the southeast or south, the smoke haze is not being blown towards Singapore at this time. Some states in Peninsular Malaysia have been experiencing a deterioration in their air quality since  late morning yesterday with the highest Air Pollutant Index reading at 5 am today being 98 in Bukit Rambai, Malacca. Over the next two days, dry weather conditions are expected to persist in most parts of Sumatra. Should there be a change in the wind direction to blow from the west, Singapore may then experience hazy conditions.  NEA will provide further haze alerts to the public if these events become more likely."

We met in the aftermath of the worst haze episode that we have ever experienced. 

We told the other ministers quite frankly that this could not be business as usual. Our people expect and deserve more effective ways to prevent future episodes.

Singapore has developed a computerised Haze Monitorig System that would combine hot spot data, high-resolution satellite pictures and concession maps to help hold companies accountable for fires in their areas. In the interests of transparency, we wanted to make this tool available for public use.

Unfortunately, several governments objected to the publication of land concession maps, citing legal impediments. After intense consultations, we compromised and the governments agreed to share such data at a government-to-governmet level subject to the ASEAN Leaders’ approval in October 2013. 

It is a pity that we could not get greater transparency and public access. Nevertheless, we note that several NGOs have already published concession maps. We will continue to work with these NGOs to maximise consumer pressure on errant companies.

We welcomed Indonesia’s commitmet to seek ratification of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution by the end of the year. We also renewed our offers of bilateral cooperative projects at a provincial level.

We are also considering legislative amendments that will enable measures to be taken against errant companies for causing transboundary haze. This will take some time, and I will provide an update later."

30332546206_10151464401846207,"The need for ethical professional leadership and how doctors are key cost drivers in healthcare.

Edited excerpts of a speech I made at a NUS Commencement Ceremony on 14 July 2013.

Good morning and congratulations to those of you who are receiving your degrees today, and even heartier congratulations to the families that stand behind each one of you this morning.  

	There is a great difficulty in making speeches like this – I could read from the prepared text or I could tell you how I feel.  If you do not mind, I want to tell you how I feel, not as a Minister, but speaking as someone who has walked in the shoes of everyone of you today, who is receiving a post-graduate degree.

	A lot has changed in the field of medicine in the last few decades – even in the decades since I graduated and trained in ophthalmology. I want to make three points for your consideration.  The first on professional leadership, the second on healthcare costs, and the third, on the need for professional humility.

	Let me deal with the first.  We pride ourselves on belonging to a noble profession, and indeed, I can tell you that as someone who has had to make the transition from medicine to politics, I can assure you, medicine appears a far more noble profession. I say so, on the basis of the experience as I walk around the neighborhood - I still have people come up to me, warmly shake my hands and say, “ You operated on my child, you operated on my mother, and they are well, and they wish you all the very best”. I can tell you that as a politician, you do not get that kind of gratitude - so you have all made the right choice!

	Having said that medicine is a noble profession, we need to also understand the difference between a profession and being technically-trained as doctors.  By definition, a profession is not just an assembly of learned men and women; it is not just about self-regulation although this is something medical professionals all over the world take pride in.  We need to remember that if we are to retain self-regulation, and to retain the trust and gratitude of our patients, then it is essential that we continue to exercise professional leadership.  

Now what do I mean by professional leadership? It goes beyond being up-to-date. For instance, research is almost an industrial activity nowadays, if you look at the volume of papers that are being published today.  But we need collectively as a profession to be able to critically analyse that research, to apply the lessons learnt to real- life needs which our patients seated in front of us are confronting.  

	We also need to ensure the highest quality control. When I was training in ophthalmology, my mentor Professor Arthur Lim insisted on recording every single operation that we did. The 99% of the time that operations were successful, you could throw away the tape; but that odd occasion when an operation was not so successful, that was the time the tape needed to be reviewed by the surgeon, by his peers and by his mentors.  Initially it was an uncomfortable experience – “big brother” was always watching me.  But this obsession with quality control and this commitment to always keep on improving, even when mistakes were made, are essential if we are to retain the trust of our patients.  

	Another aspect - which I am sure all of you can relate to - is the commitment to training our juniors. All of us “stand on the shoulders of giants”. We are not where we are now because we are the smartest people in class, but because someone else has taken the time to teach us, to mentor us, to guide us. And equally, if we are be a profession, and to exercise professional leadership, then we need to make sure we do the same for those who come after us, and have the confidence to make sure they do better than we did.  The worst thing that can happen to you is to work for an insecure boss – I have been blessed because I always had secure bosses, secure leaders, secure mentors who never held anything back, who gave me the best that they could and tried to ensure that I could do even better.  

	The final point of professional leadership is about putting patients’ interest first. The problem with medicine is that we have an extremely long gestation period – in the batch here this morning, you are all post-graduates, we are all overgrown, and probably wearing out the welcome of our parents at home.  Sometimes, there is a temptation that because it has taken us so long, we are in a hurry.  But there are no short-cuts. I would suggest to you, do not ever forget the old aphorism - “first, do no harm”. Our patients’ interests must always come first and everything else is secondary. So those are some thoughts I want to leave you, on medicine as a profession and on the necessity for all of us to exercise leadership by being grounded on values and the ethics behind the profession.  If we lose sight of that, we will forfeit the right to the profession, and others will relegate us.

	Let me quickly come to the second point - on healthcare costs.  The greatest crisis facing healthcare systems all over the world, and not just in Singapore, is the cost of healthcare. In almost every other field, whether it is engineering, computers - pick any field that you like - the advent of better and newer technology has meant that things become better, cheaper and more accessible.  For some strange, unique reason, this is not happening in healthcare, and all over the world, healthcare costs are escalating at unsustainable rates. 

	Now as a politician who has had a journey in healthcare, I know that the politically sexy topics are the loud arguments about subsidies, the role of insurance, third-party payer systems and all that. Those are important political debates, but I submit to you that in fact that is not the crux of the matter. Because the arguments about subsidies, insurance and third-party payments merely transfer the bills around, it does not address the core issue – the unsustainable escalation of the full, total real costs of healthcare.  

	One lesson which I learnt as a medical administrator is that the key cost drivers in any healthcare system actually are the doctors.  Why? Because there is always going to be an asymmetry of information - we should always know more than our patients. But because of that asymmetry, there will never ever be a totally free market in healthcare. Our patients depend on us – they take our advice on the basis of faith, of trust.  Therefore, what procedures they undergo, what drugs they use, what tests to go for – these are decisions not made by politicians, these are decisions made by us, as medical professionals.  So the real cost drivers, the real decision-makers for the full cost of healthcare, are actually going to be the doctors and healthcare professionals in this room.  Therefore I am appealing to you, that even as we delve deeper and deeper into our specialties, deeper and deeper into our profession, do not lose sight of the fact that we are also responsible for our patient’s wallets. And if we are to be responsible about that, then it behoves us as medical professionals, to gain at least a functional appreciation of finance and healthcare costs, because our decisions matter. And if we do not pay attention to this, ultimately our patients, ultimately our societies pay the full cost of it, regardless of politics.  So that is my second appeal to you – pay attention to healthcare costs.

	The third and final point I want to make is something I have come to appreciate more in my current phase of life.   And that is, that actually more lives have been saved by engineers, public health inspectors, the people who ensure clean water, safe food, proper sewage, drainage and a safe environment.  As doctors, we are used to being top of the class; we are used to being the lead surgeon; we are used to being the person everyone listens to at the bedside. But remember, we are only curing. The really big difference is in prevention - preventing people from falling sick in the first place. Therefore, my third appeal to you is to take on the attitude of professional humility and understand that we are only part of a much larger team and a system that truly gives people security and preventive healthcare. 

	The other big area that is unfolding in front of us is the management of chronic diseases. The management of chronic diseases is not a matter of cure - it is the matter of marshalling all the resources of the system, so that people are treated in the most optimal way possible for the long term. We need systems thinking rather than individual cures. If we are humble enough to understand that, we will also realise that the solution to the management of chronic problems is not going to be more sophisticated doctors, but really, a more effective healthcare system in the fullest sense of the word.
	
	So, let me thank you for this opportunity to be here with you on this auspicious occasion, to share with you, to reflect on my own journey and hopefully give you some pointers.  To reiterate, remember you are a professional; remember to exercise leadership; remember that our patients depend on us; and the difference between a profession and a trade is the sense of ethics. Pay attention to healthcare costs – because our decisions matter. Finally, just remember to be humble enough to acknowledge that we are merely one member of a much larger team.  

	I wish you all the very best from the bottom of my heart, and a most fulfilling career. May you continue to make a huge difference in the lives of everyone that you touch.  Thank you very much."

30332546206_10151454245186207,"The core issue is integrity - Hawkers vs AHPETC 

Many well-intended people advised me not to pursue this saga. It was too mundane, and people wanted to move on.

But I felt duty bound to resolve this matter, because it goes far beyond clean ceilings.

The core issue is integrity. 

The Property Manager of AHPETC, Mr Tai Vie Shun, demanded extra money from hawkers for cleaning the high areas of hawker centres. He did so on three occasions – 8 March 2013, 26 April 2013 and 28 April 2013. The hawkers have confirmed this consistently, and their account is backed up by notes of meetings.

When this scandal came to light, instead of putting things right, the Town Council Chairman, Ms Sylvia Lim, and the Vice-Chairman, Mr Pritam Singh, publicly denied that the Town Council had ever asked hawkers for more money.

That was why I said in Parliament that these denials by Ms Lim and Mr Singh were false and untruthful. And I say it again here.

Ms Sylvia Lim acknowledged that this was a very grave charge, but then she beat around the bush, and claimed confusion between spring and annual cleaning. But how can she, on the one hand, claim that the Town Council never asked for more money; and then, on the other hand, maintain that this was spring and not annual cleaning, i.e. the Town Council was justified to ask for more money?  

Mr Pritam Singh sat conspicuously silent throughout the proceedings. 

Mr Low Thia Kiang argued that it was all ‘a misunderstanding’. But interestingly he did not strongly defend the Town Council’s actions, or Ms Lim and Ms Singh’s public denials. 

Politics is a contest for power, but people with power must never take advantage of those in their charge. Equally important, we must always be honest with everyone, including ourselves, especially if a mistake has been made. I therefore urged Mr Low to conduct a full investigation and clean up his Town Council. 

To my surprise, at this point Mr Low, Ms Lim and Mr Singh all chose to remain silent, and raised no further questions or objections, and so the debate in Parliament ended."
30332546206_10151452496346207,"What a difference 3 weeks make! Our skies were blue and the air crystal clear today.

Had a long discussion in Parliament on the cause of the haze and our plans for the future. I thanked Singaporeans for your calmness, patience, and the fact that you refused to get rattled by the situation. It is that ability to respond sensibly, rationally, cohesively and collectively as a people that makes the difference and makes me confident that we will get through this together, whatever happens.

See transcript below.

1	Madam Speaker, what a difference three weeks make. And I would like to reassure you: you won’t need your haze action plan today. Today, our 24-hour rolling average PM2.5 is as low as between 6 to 9 micrograms per cubic metre. In fact, this is the level which we hope we can achieve on a long-term basis - this is our long-term aspirational target. I say this so that you understand how much and how quickly things change in a short space of time. Let me address questions 15 to 20 collectively, with your permission. 

MEWR’s Mission
2	A major component of my Ministry and that of the NEA’s mission is to protect the public health of Singaporeans – public hygiene, food safety and the quality of air and water that we all breathe and drink. This is ultimate democracy: the air that we all breathe and the water that we all drink. This commitment also extends to the haze, although quite frankly, where the haze is concerned, our hands are somewhat more tied than in other areas. With the haze, we have no direct sight of the source at all – it is hundreds of kilometres away and is spread over an area that is many times the size of Singapore. In fact, various estimates have shown that every year, the area of forest that is burnt is probably about seven times the size of Singapore. So this is on a scale that probably most of us cannot even imagine.  Our objectives therefore are to detect the fires early, to warn if it is imminent, and to mitigate the effects of the haze if it does arrive. 

Early Warning
[SLIDE 1 – Hotspots with some covered by cloud cover]
3	Let me get the first slide up. To detect the fires, we use satellite pictures like this – this was the situation on the 14th of June. You’ll notice the white clouds and if you look carefully you’ll see a few red spots. These are hotspots. But the point I wanted to make with this slide is that even with a satellite picture, if there’s local cloud cover, you will not be able to see every hotspot that is burning beneath them. You will not be able to assess the ferocity of the fires or the density of the plumes, and there is also the subsequent question of the wind. As every sailor knows, wind can be both a blessing and a bane.  Similarly, when you wake up in the morning and look out of your window, whether it is a blue or hazy sky depends very much on the location and number of the fires, the density of the smoke and the direction of the wind.  And we must not forget that while the fires are beyond our immediate sight, the haze actually only takes a few hours to reach us. This makes early warning very challenging even with perfect knowledge of the ground situation and winds. Under ideal conditions, the longest warning that we can have from the time the smoke emerges from the fire to the time the haze hits us is around 6-10 hours. This helps frame how difficult early warning is.  

An Assessment on the Haze
4	Ms Irene Ng asked me to share my assessment of the haze situation.   Frankly, the haze is not a problem that will go away easily or quickly.  This is a complex problem, and not least because it originates from the fires on land in another sovereign country.

[SLIDE 2 – Hotspots with Smoke Plumes]
5	Let me show you a second slide. This was the situation on the 19th of June. This slide shows you, quite dramatically, the extent of the burning that quite often takes place in Sumatra – you can see many more red dots now, those are the hotspots. And what is most obvious in this picture are the yellow plumes: the haze that is emanating from Sumatra and flowing across the Straits to Singapore. The problem transcends an environmental solution because the root cause of this is really commercial.  Some big-time plantation companies and paper mills have a total disregard for their social and environmental responsibilities and indeed of the local Indonesian laws themselves.  Their actions have severely affected millions of people in Indonesia itself, in Malaysia, and of course, the five million of us resident in Singapore.  My Ministry and the other agencies have been working with Indonesia over the years to press for solutions. But let me also tell you very frankly, the improvements have been incremental at best.  I will say more about this later. 

The Government’s Response
6	The recent haze spell was particularly bad three weeks ago because there was a dry spell in Sumatra – indeed, Members would also recall that there was a dry spell in Singapore as well at that same point in time. There was also an unfavourable wind – basically the wind was blowing from the west and conveying all this smoke across the Straits to Singapore. We were already gearing up for the onset of the haze season – in fact, this is somewhat earlier than the usual haze season in other years – but the situation deteriorated sharply during a very short period.  Nonetheless, given the circumstances, our officers acted swiftly and they worked very hard to detect, to give warning, and to put in place mitigation measures.  Let me go through the chronology of events with you.

[SLIDE 3 – Hotspot Counts with Annotation of Events]
7	This slide plots the number of physical hotspots over the course of time from 12 June until 7 July. It is annotated by key events.

8	The inter-agency Haze Task Force (HTF), which comprises 23 public agencies, was set up in 1994 to co-ordinate our national action plans to ensure accurate information flow and to put in place plans to ensure service continuity. This task force met on 29 May 2013, before the haze unfolded, in order to update these plans. 

9	Er Dr Lee asked when my Ministry first alerted the Indonesian Government on the haze.  On 14 June 2013, the hotspot count was 46 in Sumatra, and 41 of these hotspots were in Riau. However, the full extent of hotspot activities could not be fully determined from the satellite images due to the cloudy conditions as I showed you earlier on.  The PSI readings had moved from Good to Moderate at 1pm on 14 June.   That same day, NEA issued a public haze advisory – I am not sure how many Members actually read the public haze advisory on the 14th of June. NEA also updated its website.   NEA contacted the Head of the Forest Fires Division of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment to seek an urgent update of the ground situation and to request that urgent measures be taken to mitigate the haze. 

10	Unfortunately, the situation worsened on 17 June 2013. Satellite pictures now showed 113 hotspots in Sumatra, of which 106 were in Riau. The 24-hr PSI at 3pm on 17 June 2013 had increased to 67-80 (Moderate) .   At this point, NEA issued another public haze advisory.   

11	The CEO (NEA) sent an official note to the Deputy Minister of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment on 17 June 2013 to warn of an alarming increase in the number of hotspots in Sumatra and sought Indonesia’s assistance to enforce the appropriate legislation on plantation companies to prohibit slash and burn.  The CEO(NEA) also wrote to the Malaysian Department of Environment, because the Malaysians are currently the host of the next Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze. He requested the Malaysians to advance the meeting.

12	On 18 June 2013, the next day, the satellite pictures showed 187 hotspots in Sumatra. The PSI was now 115 – 127 (Unhealthy).  That same day, I telephoned my counterpart, the Indonesian Environment Minister, Balthasar Kambuaya to express my grave concern.  I requested Indonesia take action to put out the fires and offered our assistance. I also requested him to publish the concession maps – this has been something I have been urging for a very long time – so that we could identify the companies and the persons who were responsible for these fires. Our Foreign Minister Shanmugam separately called the Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa the same day. I followed up with a letter to Minister Kambuaya on 19 June 2013 to reiterate our grave concerns and to re-offer assistance.

13	In response to our calls, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry called for an emergency meeting with Singapore on 20 June 2013 in Jakarta. Despite the short notice, our delegation led by CEO(NEA) and comprising staff of MEWR, NEA and MFA, attended the meeting where we reiterated our concerns, offered assistance and called on Indonesia to take further actions to address the haze.  The Indonesian officials conveyed that they were taking action at the provincial level in tackling the on-going fires. 

14	To further underscore the seriousness of the situation, Prime Minister Lee sent me to Jakarta as his Special Envoy on 21 June 2013 to convey his personal letter to the Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.  The letter stressed the following: (i) this is a recurring problem with regional implications; (ii) strong and effective action is needed to be taken against the companies involved in illegal land clearing practices; (iii) if any Singapore-linked companies were involved, Indonesia should share with us the evidence so that we could pursue the matter; (iv) the countries in the region have to work together to overcome the problem; and (v) Singapore stood ready to cooperate fully with Indonesia.  This included renewing the environmental collaboration between Singapore and Jambi province or indeed, expanding that cooperation to other provinces as well.  As with previous years, we offered a haze assistance package that included aircraft for cloud seeding, satellite imagery and hotspot coordinates.  The Environment Minister of Indonesia received the letter on President Yudhoyono’s behalf. 

15	President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono replied formally to PM Lee on 3 July 2013.  He acknowledged the seriousness of the situation this year, and he informed PM Lee that the Indonesian authorities would undertake comprehensive investigations so that “those responsible are firmly held to account”.  He highlighted Indonesia’s fire-fighting efforts to reduce the number of hot spots.  The President also stated that the Government of Indonesia has been in the final stages of resubmitting the ASEAN Agreement on Trans-Boundary Haze Pollution to Indonesia’s House of Representatives (DPR) for ratification by the House.  The President also very graciously reiterated his apologies and reassured us that they would spare no effort to address this problem. 

16	On the domestic front, my colleague, the Minister for Defence has explained the convening and the actions of the Crisis Management Group.  And as you are also aware, PM Lee appointed the Haze Inter-Ministerial Committee led by Minister Ng Eng Hen on 20 June 2013 to coordinate a Whole-of-Government response.  

17	From this chronology of events, you will see that the Government has been monitoring the haze situation closely over many years and more closely over the last one month and we did our best to get the Indonesian authorities to deal with the source of the problem, even as we geared up to take protective action locally.  

18	I said earlier that we have been working with the Indonesian Government to try to improve the situation on the ground. Let me give you some idea of the current state of play at the ground.

Regional Cooperation
19	First, at the Government-to-Government level, we need Indonesia and other like-minded countries to commit more seriously to work together to tackle transboundary haze.  Mr Muhamad Faisal and Mr Yee asked about the progress of the regional agreements and platforms established to address transboundary haze.  The ASEAN Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP) was endorsed by the ASEAN Environment Ministers in December 1997 – a long time ago – arising from the period of intense fire and transboundary haze pollution that year. This has since been superseded by the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution formulated in 2002.  The latter built on the ideas from the RHAP such as monitoring, assessment and prevention, technical cooperation and scientific research, and mechanisms for coordination.

20	Under this framework, Singapore hosts the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) that monitors the regional hotspot situation and provides early warning to all affected countries – meaning not just Singapore, this is a regional centre – when the ASMC observes a significant rise in hotspot counts.  Meanwhile, an ASEAN Coordinating Centre (ACC) facilitates the channeling of regional resources to countries requesting for assistance to combat fires.  However, the 2002 ASEAN Agreement has yet to be ratified by Indonesia. I hope this agreement will be ratified by the time the ASEAN Environment Ministers meet in October this year.  The credibility of ASEAN depends very much on the willingness of its individual members to live up to our international obligations.  However, while Indonesia’s ratification of the treaty will send a strong signal of high-level political commitment, this in itself may not be sufficient to prevent the haze if the measures taken on the ground – investigations and enforcement – remain weak.  

21	Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked whether there had been any progress in tackling the haze issue since October 2012.  In 2006, Singapore initiated a sub-regional grouping - the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution - this comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.  The MSC has met 14 times since then, focusing on assisting Indonesia in implementing its Plan of Action to combat haze.  At the last (14th) meeting of the MSC in Oct 2012, the MSC Ministers agreed to explore sharing concession maps and using satellite and mapping technologies to monitor hotspots in order to hold plantation companies and land owners accountable for their land-clearing practices.  A technical task force currently led by Singapore and comprising experts from other MSC countries is now studying the implementation details.  The technology platform will be ready soon. What we need now is for all the countries to provide official, accurate concession maps and we will push urgently for this at the upcoming MSC meeting next week (15 to 17 Jul 2013).  

22	To make a stronger push for concrete actions, I will be seeking clear deliverables from next week’s MSC meeting.  To Singapore, the key outcomes that we want from next week are the following:

(i)	MSC countries submit their concession maps and agree to a date for the public launch of the ASEAN Sub-Regional Haze Monitoring System platform that will enable the identification of errant companies;
  
(ii)	MSC countries involve high-level officials from all relevant ministries and agencies from each country. The reason for this is because this is not a pure environmental problem. We need, in the case of Indonesia, to have the cooperation and full support of other ministries like the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Natural Resources, and this requires a Whole-of-Government approach and commitment – not just confined to the Ministries of Environment;

(iii)	We hope that Indonesia will agree to renew the collaboration that we have successfully had in Jambi and in other provinces, if possible; and

(iv)	Indonesia commits to ratify the ASEAN Transboundary Haze Pollution Agreement as soon as possible.

Bilateral Collaboration
[SLIDE 4 – Picture of Air Monitoring Station at Jambi]
23	Let me now move on to bilateral collaborations, which Mr Ang has asked about.  I have mentioned briefly our collaboration with the province of Jambi.  I would characterise this as one of our more successful efforts and indeed we did observe a greater reduction in the number of hotspots in Jambi Province during our years of collaboration compared to other fire-prone provinces in Sumatra.  The action programmes benefited the local authorities and communities by enhancing their capabilities and knowledge in the areas of fire prevention, fire suppression and alternative livelihoods.  A major success factor was the strong support given by the then Governor of Jambi, Pak Zulkifli Nurdin. This illustrates the necessity for political buy-in and commitment at the provincial level and on the ground. Unfortunately, this collaboration was not renewed after 2011.

24	The picture shows – if you look very carefully, you will see a tall pole, that is a meteorological pole which helps gather meteorological data: wind direction, moisture, rain, etc. If you look even more closely you will see a little small box in which are analysers for air quality. These were provided to our colleagues in Jambi by the Singapore government but all technology requires maintenance and repair. Unfortunately this is now not working and we have not been able to gain access to fix it but we hope that the Indonesian government will renew these agreements and allow us to do more work at the local level on a mutually beneficial basis.

25	We have conveyed to Indonesia that we want to renew this collaboration and we also want to undertake projects which promote sustainable agricultural practices.  In fact, President Yudhoyono had already agreed to support this when he met PM Lee in April 2013 and we have been awaiting confirmation from our Indonesian counterparts.  We stand ready to replicate this project with Jambi in other fire-prone provinces such as Riau – which was the source of most of the haze that hit us this time round. 

Engaging All Stakeholders

26	Secondly, beyond Government-to-Government engagement, my Ministry has also been engaging stakeholders and interest groups ranging from Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and think-tanks to companies. We believe this is a useful and essential complement to the inter-Governmental processes. For this reason, at the sub-regional level, we have initiated a forum that will enable the MSC countries to reach out to existing and potential stakeholders, to exchange best practices, and to form new partnerships.  My Ministry organised and hosted the first MSC forum in 2009.  In 2012, the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA) supported Brunei in hosting the second MSC forum. This forum involves NGOs, academics, companies, and other relevant stakeholders. It is a process that exists in parallel to inter-Government processes.

27	My Ministry has also been identifying and will be approaching companies to encourage them to establish a positive model in the operation and management of plantations. We want to show that such responsible practices are workable, practical, sustainable, and viable; and we hope that this will become the accepted way of doing business and will be replicated across the industry.

28	Third, I would like to respond to Mr Nicholas Fang and Ms Irene Ng who asked about the steps other stakeholders, including Singaporeans, can take to ensure a long-term solution.  Every one of us as a consumer has the power to influence the behaviour of a company.  A key cause of the haze is the clearance of plantation land by burning because this is the cheapest way to do so. Let me give an idea of the scale. To pay someone and give that person a jerry-can of kerosene to burn one hectare of forest costs about SGD6. If you pay a team of contractors to use chainsaws to cut forest, tractors and bulldozers to clear the logs, and then plough the ground, it will cost you thousands of dollars more. Between SGD6 and thousands of dollars, that is the profit motive; that is where the source of the haze lies. And that is why we need not only legislation but also consumer pressure to be applied – otherwise the temptation to go for the cheapest way or the most unsustainable, irresponsible way; that temptation would be too great. Through our purchasing decisions, we can punish businesses that undertake illegal burning and reward those which adopt sustainable practices.  The supply chain also has a role here.  I was very encouraged to learn that the Singapore Manufacturers’ Federation (SMa) urged its members not to have any business dealings with errant organisations and their subsidiaries involved in these illegal fires.  The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) has also called on five of its member companies alleged to be involved in illegal land clearing in Indonesia to submit digital maps of their plantations and aid its investigations.  I encourage more of such ground-up, non-governmental approaches to hold people accountable and to ensure that transparency and data is available.

Conclusion
[SLIDE 5 – Graphics on MSS Capabilities]
29	Let me conclude by saying that my Ministry’s core mission in the haze episode has been to detect, to warn and to mitigate. In the areas of detection and warning, the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) of the NEA is looking to enhance its capabilities for the early warning of haze. This includes making use of more meteorological data, finer resolution satellite imagery, enhanced dispersion modeling capabilities and installation of more sensors. Let me try to explain what all that means. For instance, by next year, and certainly by 2015, we will be gaining feeds from new satellites which have greater resolution – we need resolution down to about a 1-2 kilometre range to be able to identify a hotspot. The new satellites will also have greater spectral sensitivity which means you can also see fires in an early stage, maybe even at the underground level. Third, we need more wind sensors – not only in Singapore, but indeed in the Straits and in the shores beyond as well. These wind sensors will input into the more complicated computer models which predict weather patterns, whether there will be rain or drought; winds, speed of the wind, which determines how fast the haze reaches us; direction of the wind, which is the difference between why we had a clear Saturday on the 22nd and Muar in Johor was completely overcome by haze. These sophisticated computer models are still in the state of development but as Dr Ng said just now, what we need is to be able to predict the haze, the density, not one hour from now or not 24 hours ago, but for the next 24 hours. So in the same way people have gotten used to weather forecasts, we will have to upgrade out capability to be able to give you haze forecasts because these forecasts are how you will plan your day: what activities businesses need to take, schools, hospitals. Everything depends on a forward-looking prediction. I cannot give you the assurance that we can be a hundred percent accurate – it’s not possible; everyone who engages in weather forecasting knows that – but we can improve the precision of our forecasts. That is something which we are going to have to work very hard on over the next 1-2 years. 

30	I also cannot emphasise enough that, for a lasting and permanent solution, we need the firm commitment and resolute action by the Indonesian Government at all levels.  We appreciate that the President of Indonesia has acknowledged the severity of the situation and has given his commitment to tackle the issue. Quite frankly, I think that it was his apology and his commitment that made a difference on the ground and helped to reduce or at least prevented people from starting more fires without having to worry about consequences. Of course, we were helped by the rains which have now fallen over Sumatra over the last one week.  We will stand ready to work and to do our best with Indonesia as a close neighbour and as a partner in ASEAN.

31	The haze situation today has improved a lot compared to what we faced three weeks ago. But I also want to be honest with Singaporeans, to tell you that this beautiful day which we have now could be only a temporary respite. The dry season is not over yet. We need continued vigilance and we need decisive action by Indonesian authorities to prevent another recurrence of the haze over the next 2-3 months.   MEWR and NEA will do our part to detect and give warning of the haze and to mitigate its impact but we need the support and cooperation of all stakeholders.

32	I also want to end by thanking Singaporeans for their calmness, their patience, and the fact that they refused to get rattled by the situation. It is that ability to respond sensibly, rationally, cohesively and collectively as a people that makes the difference and makes me confident that we will get through this together, whatever happens. Thank you, Madam Speaker."

Because the PM2.5 figures are not yet in the healthy range, we have maintained the same advisory. Healthy persons don't need masks, some sensible precautions should still be exercised.

Unfortunately, the fires in Sumatra are still generating haze, as shown in this dramatic satellite picture. So we are still not out of danger yet.

On another less cheerful note, we still had 853 cases of dengue last week - so there is no basis for the theory that haze would reduce the mosquitoes. 

We need to focus on both problems simultaneously. I would like to thank the hundreds of NEA Dengue inspectors and volunteers who have continued their essential work despite the difficult circumstances. I hope residents will support them as they strive to protect us all."
30332546206_10151426738701207,"More good news - there has been an improvement in air quality since last night, and this improvement has been sustained this morning. As at 12 noon today, the 24-hr PSI is 88-98 and the 24-hr PM2.5 is 81-102 microgrammes/cubic metre.

The improvement in the air quality is due to a change in the direction of the low level winds over Singapore, from south-westerly to southerly, since last night. The 24- hour PSI for the rest of today is expected to be in the Unhealthy band (101-200) instead of the earlier forecasted band of 201-300.

However, we must remain prepared for further fluctuations depending on weather conditions. Will keep you all updated."

I met several hundred local residents queueing for masks at Unity Pharmacy in Bukit Panjang Plaza. Very glad that all managed to get their masks eventually. I am very grateful to the grassroots volunteers and staff of the pharmacy who helped ensure that everything worked out well in the end. Thank you all for your patience.

30332546206_10151423843816207,"Went to Jakarta to personally deliver PM Lee’s letter to President SBY. I met the Minister for Environment of Indonesia Balthasar Kambuaya. We had a frank constructive meeting.

I told him that our 3 hour PSI had reached 401 today, and that millions of Singaporeans, Malaysians and Indonesians were badly affected by the haze. We needed immediate definitive action on the ground. This was a man made disaster, and men had to fix it. We could not wait for the rain or wind to rescue us.

He told me that Indonesia appreciated the seriousness of the situation. They were going to try to use water bombs to put out the fires. I urged urgent action, and reiterated Singapore’s offer to assist in any way.

Minister Balthasar also imformed me that investigations using our satellite maps had identified 8 plantation companies suspected to be responsible for some of the fires. I urged him to expedite the investigations, identify these companies publicly and to prosecute them. 

I took the opportunity to urge Indonesia to ratify the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze. Although the agreement was signed in 2002, Indonesia is the only country in ASEAN that has not yet ratified it. He told me that President and ministers support the ratification, but need the approval of Parliament.

We also agreed to bring forward the meeting for ASEAN ministers to review the haze situation.

I repeated our offer to collaborate with Jambi and Riau provinces on projects focussed on sustainable agriculture and appropriate management of peat land.

All in all, it was a good meeting, but we need to see results on the ground.

The satellite pictures show fewer hotspots in Sumatra, but there are still thick plumes of smoke being blown across to Singapore. Unfortunately, there is not likely to be any rain or change in wind direction for the next few days. So the condition will persist or may even worsen.

We will have to make further changes to our daily routine.

Senior citizens, young children, people with respiratory or cardiac conditions will have to be specially careful to avoid outdoor activities. Please consult a doctor if you have any discomfort or symptoms.

The rest of us will have to reduce strenuous outdoor activities or use N95 masks during these periods. MOH has restocked retail outlets, and we should all be able to get masks if necessary. The government has a large stockpile of masks, and there will be more than enough for everyone who needs one.

PM Lee also announced a special subsidy scheme for young Singaporeans aged 18 and below, elderly Singaporeans aged 65 and above, CHAS (Community Health Assist Scheme) card holders, PA and Medical Fee Exemption Card holders. If you need to see a doctor for any haze related illness, you will only need to pay $10, whilst MOH will foot the rest of the bill. The government will ensure that everyone who needs care will be able to get treatment.

It is not possible to predict when the crisis will be over. It could be days or weeks. Or it could even come back a month or two later. Therefore, we have to find practical reasonable ways for life to go on, but to take special care for those of us who are more vulnerable and to take sensible precautions. 

Each evening, the government will review all the data, assess the potential impact on our activities and issue advisories for the next day. We will also keep everyone fully informed as the situation evolves. Let's carry on the best we can, looking out for each other.

This is due to an escalation of hot spots in central Sumatra, with 173 hotspots detected on 19 June 2013. The wind and weather conditions will remain constant and we expect the haze to persist or even worsen before improving.

Because of this, we will all have to make adjustments to our daily routine for the next few days. All Singaporeans should limit prolonged or heavy outdoor activities. In particular, children, elderly and those with heart or lung conditions should avoid outdoor activities and seek medical treatment if they feel unwell. MOH has activated hospitals to prepare for any anticipated increase in patients.

The Inter-Agency Haze Task Force, which comprises 23 government agencies has been activated and is coordinating respective action plans.

On the international front, we need urgent and definitive action by Indonesia to tackle the problem at source. Singaporeans have lost patience, and are understandably angry, distressed and concerned. Both Minister Shanmugam and I have earlier conveyed the seriousness and urgency of the situation to our respective counterparts in Indonesia.

I suggested Minister Kambuaya name the companies responsible for the fires - (as I am sure consumers will know what to do).

We are also waiting for Indonesia to publish the concession maps. The combination of satellite photos, which are updated daily, and these concession maps would enable us to pin point the errant companies.

I also offered the assistance of the Singapore government - and he said he would revert after his team assesses the situation on the ground.

30332546206_10151339943661207,"More than 5000 persons have been infected with dengue this year. This is more than we had the whole of last year. At this rate, this may be our worst dengue epidemic ever.

There are several reasons for this spike. 

First, we have a susceptible population because many have not been exposed to dengue before, ironically because of our past dengue control efforts.

Second, the predominant circulating dengue virus serotype has changed from Den-2 to Den-1, which our population has lower immunity against. The new dominant viral strains are exhibiting higher epidemic potential, i.e. they spread faster. Many of the clusters we are seeing now are Den-1 clusters, and a number of them have 10 or more cases. 
For the past few months, most of these Den-1 clusters were in the eastern parts of Singapore. However, we are seeing some of these Den-1 clusters emerging in the northern area in recent weeks.

Third, the dengue mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, has also been making inroads into new areas in the north and west, as compared with the situation in 2005.  So it may be only a matter of time before we see clusters emerge here, and we must stay vigilant. With the low herd immunity in our communities and changing virus strains, a small increase in mosquito population is all it takes to result in localised outbreaks. 
	
I am very grateful to the tireless NEA officers and the many volunteers who have been working tirelessly to inspect homes, public places, construction sites and so on. 
	
In areas where dengue is actively transmitting, NEA will shorten the time required to make the first inspection of all premises. Currently the average time taken is about two weeks, and we will target to reduce this timeframe by as much as half. I hope residents will understand the need for urgency and cooperate with us.

However, NEA officers cannot be present everywhere all the time and we thus need a concerted community response to this dengue threat.

We are embarking on a national campaign today to simultaneously eliminate mosquito breeding sites island wide in order to break the cycle of transmission. This is an opportunity to stop the momentum of the epidemic, and I appeal for a concerted effort by everyone.

I will never forget the evening of 22 April 2003 when I was informed that Alex had just passed away upstairs at the SGH ICU.

Singapore was in the depths of the SARS epidemic. Although he was supposed to be on overseas leave with his wife, Woon Puay, he made a fateful decision cut short his trip and return to work at SGH. 

SARS was a new and unknown threat at that time, and it struck health care providers disproportionately. And yet, Alex, just like every single person I worked with in the hospital at that time, knew instinctively what courage and duty meant. 

Losing Alex was a heartbreaking shock. But I also learnt just how tough, courageous, dedicated and compassionate Singaporeans could be. And emerged with renewed confidence in our future.

Sadly, his daughters and Woon Puay had their beautiful future with him ripped away. I wish you all God's peace and blessing. Know that your father was a wonderful, great man, friend and inspiration to all of us."

I would like to thank the many residents who have given feedback on the bus services within our constituency. Your feedback has been very helpful in our negotiations with LTA and SMRT.
 
Since January 2013, additional buses have been added to Services 67, 75, 178, 188, 190 and 966 in Bukit Panjang Town as part of the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP).
 
The Public Transport Operators (PTOs) have also improved 2 bus services (i.e. Services 960 and 963) between January and March 2013 as part of the on-going quarterly bus service review process. These improvements include deploying higher capacity buses and/or adding more bus trips along sectors that experience consistent high ridership to better match demand and to increase frequency/capacity along these sectors.
 
Separately we are also working closely with the bus operator, SMRT Buses, to improve some of the key bus services serving Bukit Panjang Town, e.g. Service 190, 700 and 971E in mid April 2013.
 
I do hope that there will be further improvements to the transport services even as we look forward to the completion of the MRT Downtown Line in 2015. Please continue to share your feedback with me. Together, we can make Cashew and Holland-Bukit Timah GRC a better home for our families."

I met this cherubic boy and his Chinese Singaporean father in September 2011. The father had just been diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer. Amongst the many concerns he had, the most urgent was to make sure his son became a citizen - so that he could continue to live in Singapore no matter what happened.

I asked the little boy what he wanted. He coughed loudly, and I looked puzzled at his parents. He told me he was coughing because his father was coughing a lot (due to the cancer), and he wanted to be just like his father. 

He brought tears to many eyes that night. We managed to appeal for citizenship for him, and his father passed away in March 2012 reassured that his son will always be a Singaporean.

I would prefer to have a smaller population of foreigners in our Singapore but ......

We are facing the crisis of our lifetime. Our citizen population will halve every two generations. But that is a 'long' term problem.  The real emergency is not babies, but ageing. That is why the population will increase in the short term before the inevitable decrease in the long term.

We are one of the fastest ageing nations in the world. By 2030, the number of senior citizens older than 65 years will triple to 900,000. Who will look after us? Today, we have almost six working-age citizens for every senior. In 2030, we will only have two. Even if we suddenly have an epidemic of babies now, they will only be 17 years old in 2030. Hence, we will need some kind of 'top up' over the next two decades - foreigners to work with us, care for us, pay taxes and to help create opportunities. Actually even 1M extra foreigners will still mean far less young people supporting seniors than today. However, I believe we must learn to do more with less. Actually, I hope we will need fewer foreigners. Only time will tell. In the meantime, it is essential that we start building ahead of demand and re-organise ourselves to ensure that our quality of life is enhanced and our children continue to have even more opportunities in a vibrant Singapore. 

Our main focus must be the hopes, dreams and fears of our current 3.2 M Singapore citizens and our future children. Everyone and everything else is secondary.

The headline numbers and the speed of change are scary - but we must keep our cool and decide confidently as one people on our future destiny regardless of politics. That is why the government is taking such a big political risk in publishing http://population.sg/

Hakim received the letter informing him that he won an Edusave Scholarship. He was happy, and his parents very proud. He had been an excellent student, played a leading role in the school band and was a budding actor. So the award was not really a surprise.

Unfortunately, life sometimes doesn't follow the happy script. He passed away suddenly, leaving an unfillable void and deep ache in his parents hearts. 

We decided to make a special presentation of the Scholarship to his parents. They were heartbroken, but shared his uplifting story of hope and love.

Hakim had prepared a speech that he intended to use for his father's birthday. His father found the script and shared it with us. Hakim described his father as ""a very kind, funny, clumsy and more type of Dad"". His father told him the same bedtime story every single day for 14 years. It was his way of showing love, and Hakim knew that ""He loved me every single day from then till forever"".

A new beginning for all our children – and may they fulfill all their dreams and destinies along the ‘path of the infinite’.
 
I was reminded of the wise words of Kahlil Gibran on Children – words that I believe all parents should reflect on :
 

On Children - Kahlil Gibran
 
Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you,
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.
 
You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
For they have their own thoughts.
You may house their bodies but not their souls,
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,
which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
You may strive to be like them,
but seek not to make them like you.
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
 
You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite,
and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
 Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;
 For even as He loves the arrow that flies,
 so He loves also the bow that is stable."

I remember meeting him 24 years ago at a party hosted by my mentor Professor Arthur Lim. They were classmates in medical school and life long friends.

He introduced himself as “I am Lim Hock Siew, and just came out of prison a few years ago!”

We had a good chat and he freely shared his life experiences. I was struck by the absence of bitterness despite all his sacrifices. I think he knew in his heart that he was a patriot, and was proud that he never gave in.

I consulted him before I entered politics. He did not discourage me. On the contrary, he told me to focus on doing the right thing. He told me he did not bear any ill will to the current leaders. He reminded me that he was a founding member of the PAP.

We met from time to time socially. Whenever we discussed politics, it was obvious that he was still a conviction socialist. There were times, we agreed to disagree.

Singapore has lost another member of the founding generation. We must all be deeply grateful to him and his family for all their sacrifices. He was a good and honourable man."

30332546206_10150251262496207,"This morning, the Ulu Pandan branch visited Mr Choo Siu Heng in hospital to celebrate National Day with him. He is now 81 years old and has been a volunteer and activist since the mid 1950s. He was banished by the colonial authorities to China in 1956, and was allowed to return to Singapore only after the 1959 General Election. Since then, he has been a regular presence at Meet-the-People Sessions and community events for more than 5 decades.

He has been a wonderful inspiration to all of us. He taught us the meaning of politics at a human level, fighting for what you believe in, resilience despite set-backs, perseverance, complete dedication to a cause and humility in service. Singaporeans of his generation have seen it all, and contributed so much to Singapore. We need to always remember that National Day is first, and foremost, a celebration of the people behind Singapore's success. It was only fitting that we all said ""Thank you"" to him and people of his generation on this day.

The future will not be a replay of the past. The challenges confronting the Singapore of today are different, but no less profound than those at Independence 46 years ago. We will certainly need to change and do new things differently.

But it is timely to reflect on what doesn't change. I believe it will always be about the indomitable human spirit, our shared values, our commitment to remain one united people despite diversity and the guts to keep on trying that will determine our future. I wish all Singaporeans great happiness and success on our National Day."
