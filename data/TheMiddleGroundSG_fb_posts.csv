It's unclear if the robber had any weapons, but the police confirmed that no injuries were reported. They've declined further comment as investigations are ongoing. 

Mr Jack Chan, 48, manager of nearby cafe PARK, says his staff heard nothing since they started work at 10am. It was only around 12 noon that they saw about 10 police cars, but there were no sirens. Some of the policemen were wearing helmets on top of bulletproof vests. 

We spoke to Auxillary Police Officers (APO) at the other banks in the area. At least two of the APOs said the Standard Chartered Bank branch at Holland Village has not had an APO for the past two years, apparently because of rising costs. The protocol for APOs is to raise any issues to their supervisor. They are to contact the police anytime, at their own discretion. APOs are also allowed to open fire at assailants should there be a life-threatening situation. (Photo: Najeer Yusof/TMG)"

337546116346785_741080162660043,"SUMMARY from Parliament: 

theonlinecitizen came under heavy fire from Minister of Home Affairs K Shanmugam this afternoon for allegedly publishing ""falsehoods"" and a ""bunch of lies"" in their account of Benjamin Lim's suicide. In response to a question posed by Dr Intan, MP of Ang Mo Kio GRC, on why the ministry or police did not share information about the case earlier, Mr Shanmugam said that it would be ""unseemly"" to go into a case of ""allegation and counter-allegation"". As the case was a legal proceeding, comments should have been avoided. Added Mr Shanmugam: ""Who is to say your truth is superior to my truth?"" 

To East Coast GRC MP Jessica Tan's question about the protocols of online publishing and whether websites should verify such information before they post them, Mr Shanmugam said that the law is the ""same for online and physical publications"" and that certain allegations made could infringe sub judice principles. He said that publications cannot ""make allegations of facts when they're facts that could be in dispute. It is egregious when (the allegations) are a bunch of lies. People who express their views have to be responsible for them."" 

He also said in response to Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Melvin Yong's call for an assessment of TOC's ""conduct, motivations and coverage"", that ""it is quite clear that (TOC's post) is a calculated and cynical attempt to tar the police force based on falsehood"". 

Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore) said that it was stepping out today to clarify the facts due to the assertions made online. 

By the way, AGC said it was okay for them to."
337546116346785_741075162660543,"So what else was revealed in Parliament about the circumstances surrounding the death of 14-year old Benjamin Lim? Here's what we can tell from the statements made by Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam Sc and Acting Education Minister Ng Chee Meng 黄志明: 

a. He was interviewed by one police officer, not five. It was one officer who spoke to him in school, and one officer who spoke to him in the police station - in an open plan office. That is, it wasn't five burly men staring down at the boy and he wasn't placed in an interrogation room to be given the third degree.

b. CCTV footage (not released) give credence to the police report that he had molested an 11 year old girl the day before he was picked up for questioning. If so, it is also likely that he would have got off with a warning.

c. Some 7,200 minors have been picked up by police between 2010 and 2015, said Mr Shanmugam. Mr Ng also gave a number: 1,350 arrests every year on average which involve students.

d. His family said they felt pressured into talking to the media after his suicide. But they want to be left alone now and have even asked for the Coroner's Inquiry to be ""private''. This is a call the Attorney-General will have to make."
337546116346785_741061965995196,"LIVE from Parliament:

It seems like North View Secondary School where 14-year old Benjamin Lim studied took all the steps that schools should take when police come a-calling. It isn't the practice of police to allow teachers or staff members to accompany their charges who have been picked up for questioning. BUT...this might change if the review of SOPs for minors being interviewed by police concludes that it might be good to have a teacher as an ""appropriate adult'' at the police station with the student. As for the current school processes, Acting Education Minister Ng Chee Meng 黄志明 listed eight steps, with the emphasis on discretion and keeping matters confidential.
 
There are about 1,350 arrests involving students every year.

Nope, it's not clear if all were picked up from school."

337546116346785_741061582661901,"LIVE from Parliament: 

According to the Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore), the Coroner's Inquiry is still trying to establish the cause of death. Many factors will be taken into consideration:

1. His mental state prior to the police interview.

2. The circumstances surrounding the arrest.

3. Stresses in life which may have led him to engage in the crime.

4. The events that followed after the interview."
337546116346785_741059529328773,"LIVE from Parliament:

It has been suggested that Benjamin could have been coerced into confessing the crime.

In spite of such allegations, the Singapore Police Force decided not to release evidence such as the CCTV footage so as not to sully Benjamin's memory. theonlinecitizen tried to get the police to comment, but out of respect for the Coroner's Inquiry, the police refrained from doing so. However, TOC ignored the pending Coroner's Inquiry and went on to make ""wild allegations"". MHA reiterates its stand that facts MUST be established and that it avoids jumping to conclusions when making an official statement."
337546116346785_741059042662155,"LIVE from Parliament: 

Mr K Shanmugam Sc, explained why the Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore) took so long to make a substantial comment to correct the allegations:

1. Out of respect for Benjamin's family: MHA felt that they should be given the time and the privacy to grieve over the loss of their child.

2. It would not be appropriate to discuss the facts in detail, considering that the Coroner's Inquiry is still pending. The Coroner's Inquiry is the right and more appropriate forum for the relevant facts to be dealt with."
337546116346785_741055832662476,"LIVE from Parliament: 

Minister for Home Affairs Mr K Shanmugam Sc laid out some of the facts leading up to the suicide of 14-year-old Benjamin Lim. This was to rebut online assertions, especially those published by theonlinecitizen. Mr Shanmugam raised the following points: 

1. The police were in plain clothes, and not identifiable with the word 'Police' on the back of their T-shirts as claimed.

2. At no point did Benjamin face five officers at once. Only one officer was present in the principal's office, and three got into the car with him. One officer was dropped off before they reached the station, leaving two with Benjamin.

3. Benjamin was not coerced or pressured into admitting to an offense he did not commit. 

Said Mr Shanmugam: ""These are deliberate falsehoods which are inaccurate based on the facts the police have... that led to the conclusion that Benjamin committed suicide because of the police interview."""

This is despite having the NDP at a private venue, the National Stadium at the Singapore Sports Hub, he said. Venue costs are estimated to be 15 per cent of total costs. In comparison, holding the parade at public venues such as the Padang or the Floating Platform would only incur venue costs of about 4 per cent of the total costs. 

However, the Sports Hub would be able to host 55,000 ticketed spectators - more than twice the number of ticketed spectators that either the Padang or the Floating Platform at Marina Bay can hold. Mr Ng estimated that the new site can hold about 275,000 spectators across rehearsals and the actual show. Last year's SG50 NDP parade at the Padang cost $40.5 million, while 2010's parade cost $20.6 million. 

It's a pity that the minister didn't give further figures on how much the NDP costs on non-jubilee years, such as 2014 or 2013, which might have been a better comparison to this year's estimated costs of $39.4 million."

Always the Train’s Fault
by Felix Cheong

So to test the new train,
They tripped the old one.

As putting your mom out
Like a weather vane,
No matter how loud she complains.
If she comes in dry
Like a prune too sour to try,
Then you know the sun
Is right for laundry."

Rat Race
by Felix Cheong

Amok, amok, rats run amok.
In malls, in fields, no key and no lock
Can keep Singapore’s rodent stock
From claiming rightfully their lot.

In the paper, all the talk
About how these critters have mocked
This First World city and socked
The reputation of the little red dot.

No matter the equipment brought,
How many pest controllers had caught,
Rats will welcome you when you are not
Expecting them in a buffet pot."

Make Dough While the Sun Shines
by Felix Cheong 

Bake a cookie Amos Yee,
Mashed from teenaged broccoli.
One bite, you’ll break out in cold swear
Blaming God for LKY and your bad hair.

Make a bun Dan Tan,
Slippery like a wet football for fun,
Stuffed with otah from the kelong,
Best served in jail on a song.

Create a croissant Serina Wee,
With chic French dressing, merci.
You should really stock up on a dozen
To last you that roundtripping distance.

Row out a hard-crust Jover Chew,
Contractually sold when overdue.
Read the fine print before you buy,
Or kiss your appetite goodbye.

All these suggestions only show
More than enough to inspire dough.
Just don’t touch any politician’s name,
Lesser mortals are fair game."

Another 16 charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.
Earlier this month, Jover had pleaded guilty to cheating 26 victims of $16,599 over the period of 10 months in 2014. These 26 victims consist mainly of foreigners who had been led to believe they were paying a cheaper price for new mobile phones at MobileAir but would be told to fork out additional sums for exorbitant hidden charges such as warranties before they could obtain their phone.

In some cases, Jover even chased the victim out of the shop and threatened to call the police. On Sept 24 last year, Chew and his employees made a customer, Chinese national Zou Jing Tong, pick up $1,010 in coins off his shop floor when he was ordered by Small Claims Tribunal to reimburse her.

Jover’s deeds came to light after a video of a Vietnamese tourist begging for a refund went viral. Mr Pham Van Thoai had paid $950 for an iPhone but was told he could only obtain the phone if he paid an additional warranty fee of $1,500."

State: 11 to 12 years
Judge: 8 years.

John Lam, 3 years
Sharon Tan, 1 year 9 months

However, he disagreed with its request for a 12 year sentence and imposed a 8 year one instead. He held that the sentence should not be 'disproportionate' or crushing.

Bail has been extended for all six, and their sentences will start on Jan 11 next year. Chew Eng Han has informed the court he will appeal his sentence."

BCA said that ""All the door protective devices were tested and verified to be working according to their specifications... The door protective devices cannot be proven reasonably to have failed to function properly on the day of the incident"" . 

As to what may have caused Madam Khoo to lose her hand, BCA added: ""Based on the authorised examiner's (AE) simulation, it is likely that the pull of the taut leash could have caused a fulcrum action, opening up a small gap at the base of the lift cabin doors..."" 

""Her left hand, which was partially pulled through the lift cabin doors, was crushed and severed between the lift cabin doors and the internal parts of the lift lobby doors (between the inner and outer lift doors) before the lift came to a gradual stop.""

In response, Madam Khoo's son, who had access to the preliminary report yesterday morning, said ""this may mean that the standards are too low, as they cannot protect the safety of the passenger"".

The investigation report was submitted to the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) by the AE earlier today.

Stay tuned to TMG for a fuller report later today."

She was elected in what SDP Secretary-General Dr Chee Soon Juan called an ""honorary party conference"" held last Saturday for the appointment of a new Central Executive Committee (CEC).

This comes after news today that Mr Jeffrey George, the 51-year-old former chairman of the SDP, was arrested on drug-related charges. It is not clear when he was arrested.

Replying to media queries about Mr George after the IPS conference today, Dr Chee said that “we have as much information as you” and that he “hasn’t spoken to Mr George”.

Dr Chee confirmed that Mr George does not currently hold any position in the new CEC and was not present for the election. “We didn’t know about his whereabouts at that time”.

When asked about the reason why Mr George was dropped from the CEC, Dr Chee said that “there was already a change… We didn’t know about his arrest at that time… We could not contact him.”

Dr Chee added that he would announce the changes to the CEC “in a statement"" at an unspecified date."

However the origins of the murder weapon, a serrated knife, remains a mystery. A week after the murder on July 10, Mr Loh had helped the police to confirm that Mr Tan's fishing gear was in order and that none of the knives were missing. 

He also described the fishing knives as small with smooth edges, inconsistent with the considerably bigger, jagged blade knife that the accused, Iskandar Rahmat, had drawn.

The second witness of the day was DSP Bohan Bin Said, the disciplinary officer tasked with conducting proceedings against Iskandar. Iskandar had been charged in early 2013 with violating the Police General Orders, for financial embarrassment.

The trial will resume on Monday.

337546116346785_692356600865733,"Judgement Day. Verdict: Guilty. 

Judge See Kee Oon said all six were ""crucial cogs in the machine"" to defraud City Harvest Church (CHC).

Senior Pastor and CHC Founder Kong Hee, Deputy Senior Pastor Tan Ye Peng, Member of the Governing Board and Investment Committee John Lam, former Fund Manager Chew Eng Han, former Finance Manager Serina Wee, and her successor Sharon Tan have been found guilty of all charges. The six were accused of criminal breach of trust and falsification of accounts. 

They were arrested in 2012 following a probe into financial irregularities by the Commissioner of Charities (COC) and the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD). 

The trial spanned 140 days over two years. The prosecution alleged that $24 million of church building funds were misused to finance the music career of Kong Hee’s wife, Ms Sun Ho. When CHC’s external auditors started raising questions, they falsified accounts of about $26.6 million to cover their tracks. The accused maintained there was no ill intent. Ms Ho's bid for stardom was part of a grand plan, called the Crossover Project, to spread the gospel to the ""unchurched"".

However, in today’s verdict, Judge See dismissed this defence: ""No matter how pure the motive... these do not exonerate accused persons.""

Their sentences will be announced at a later date. #CHCtrial #CityHarvest"

1 Use words like enabler, leverage, accelerate, facilitate, collaborate, sustainable framework and capacity building. 
2 Never say change but transform; never say help but a contributory factor
3 Remember that everything is now a platform, whether to make music, test out new stuff or get everybody together. If platform is unavailable, use launch pad. 
4 Besides engaging stakeholders who are not vampire killers, you need to have deep engagement, wide engagement and sometimes even extensive engagement. 
5 If you think something is okay, but not really that good, you can always call it “a step in the right direction’’. This is now in vogue even though you can’t say which direction or whether it’s a giant step for mankind.
6 Braver people can try a “turning point’’ unless you mean a U-turn which is generally not good. 
7 People never, ever have problems, they only have challenges.  
8 Services should either be one-stop, round-the-clock, real-time or online. Preferably all four. 
9 Nobody ever has an idea about anything, it’s always just an initiative. Even better if it is an innovation as well.

-----
Dear parents, partners and stakeholders,

Many of you are understandably concerned about a video of our students that has been circulating online and reported in the news recently.
The school is working with the students and parents involved. The school takes a serious view of bullying and does not condone such behaviour. We have taken to task the students who have behaved inappropriately and taken disciplinary actions. Given their youth and remorsefulness, we have counselled them to ensure they learn and make amends. I have spoken to the class involved and advised them how as bystanders they should step up to stop aggressive behaviour. The whole class has resolved to learn from this incident and to support each other to behave better.
We are grateful for the many messages of support from the Parent Support Group, partners and alumni during this period. Thank you for your confidence in the school, words of encouragement, and reminders of the good work the school has done for your children.
We will continue to believe in our students and ensure that Shuqun Secondary is an inviting school that brings out the best in everyone.

It used to be a PAP lament that its ground feedback had been wrong in predicting their electoral fortunes. Now it is the Opposition which is trying to figure out what went wrong for them. WP’s Lee Li Lian was among those who talked about the disconnect. She also cited municipal issues, but like most of the opposition politicians, declared that they had to talk internally as a party and analyse the results. WP’s Yee Jenn Jong took a swipe at the electoral boundaries report, which merged his old stomping ground Joo Chiat into Marine Parade GRC.
Reform Party’s Kenneth Jeyaretnam seemed the most bitter. He said that the people deserved the G they voted for and that people should stop complaining.

What do the results say about voters’ attitudes? That a new political party would take time to gain some traction with voters? The PPP, which contested just that one GRC, had a very low profile. SingFirst, on the other hand, has been extremely vocal about the presence of foreigners in Singapore whom it said were ""breaking up families"". PM Lee Hsien Loong appeared to be its prime target, for not measuring up to his late father’s standards. Perhaps, that was why it stood in the late Lee Kuan Yew’s Tanjong Pagar GRC ward, hoping that LKY loyalists would agree. They didn’t."

Yes, he wasn’t up against a strong challenger, even though his old antagonist blogger Roy Ngerng, was in the Reform Party slate. (Or is that giving Mr Ng too much credit?)
Will the mandate be a national wide mandate? In GE2011, PAP took 60.1 per cent of the vote. The PM hasn’t put down a number for what he would consider a good mandate. But given that the PAP has wrested one seat, Punggol East, back…
In any case, we’re not even halfway through the results and it looks like the sky isn’t turning blue nor is the sun blazing hot. In fact, the rocket looked like it didn’t have enough of a booster, with the Singapore Democratic Party losing by an even wider margin this time.

Instead, even the single-seat of Fengshan anchored by a PAP newbie, Ms Cheryl Chan, steered ahead of WP’s Dennis Tan. She got 57.52 per cent. And people had thought that Fengshan was the weak link in East Coast GRC and was booted out to save the bigger boat.
And what about Punggol-East SMC, the last acquisition of the Workers’ Party? Who would have thought veteran Charles Chong would wrest it from WP’s Lee Li Lian by 1,156 votes? It will no longer be AHPETC – in fact, will it even be AH TC?
The PAP must be relieved that with Punggol East, it did not have to go through the Potong Pasir period, in which voters stuck with Mr Chiam See Tong for 27 years. And by the way, it is also the end of the Chiam era. The hardworking Sitoh Yih Pin has cemented his foundation, perhaps with the 100-over upgrading projects that he had carried out over the past four years?

Remember how a lot of people were saying then that the status quo would remain? Then somehow, something changed along the way.

People went to the Opposition rallies, saw the crowds and forgot why they THEMSELVES were there. They were there not to listen hard to the Opposition but to revel in the atmosphere. It’s great fun to be entertained and even to let off steam. Then they go home.
They yak with their friends and shake their heads when the PAP is mentioned. There might be a swear word or two, some remembrance of a “wrong’’ done by a traffic policeman or the sight of foreigners behaving badly. What was that again about manifestos? They finish their coffee.

They get online and see fierce arguments. They watch, but they would rather not take part. The vitriol is scary. They laugh at the caricatures and cartoons, perhaps, a little nervously because they are not so comfortable with ill will and incivility. They log off. They go to work. Then they vote PAP. That's what we think happened."

I know a lot of foreigners in Singapore have been feeling uncomfortable by the hyperbolic anti-foreigner rhetoric that the on-going electioneering has generated. With my experience of living and working as a journalist in the city-state for five years [till late 2014], let me say this.
Not only you, all well-meaning Singaporeans – and there are lots and lots of them – are uncomfortable too.
But the country has seen massive influx of foreigners in the recent decade and majority of “silent” Singaporeans do feel that the ever-present and over-arching PAP Government is not listening to its citizens enough. That's why you hear this noise.
It doesn't mean that your Singaporean friends and colleagues have suddenly turned against you. No, not at all. It's just that like me and you, they are also concerned about their and their children's future.
The silent majority of Singaporeans don't want to “kick you out”. They just want their Government to ask them before letting so many of us in.
They don't believe that foreigners are responsible for everything that goes wrong with Singapore. They just want their Government to act before things go haywire.
They don't want to shout at foreigners living in Singapore. They just want their Government to listen to them a bit more.
So have faith in Singapore and Singaporeans. They are good people.
Let September 11 pass. You will always be welcomed by your Singaporean friend in the nearby HDB food court for some makan and teh tarik.
I know I will be!"

The season begins with Lord Low seeking to keep control of his sprawling estate, which is being eyed by its former owners.

Crown officials drop a bombshell: Lord Low has knowingly or unknowingly over-paid the stewards – at a time when the town was in need of funds.

The Crown officials argue that it was doing so to ensure Treasury funds and tenant rents were put to rightful use. When the venerable judge declined assent because the wrong officials were making the plea, the Crown escalated the matter to a higher Bench.. Lord Low, appalled that his privacy would be invaded, fights the Crown. The season is replete with argy-bargy legal drama as lawyers duke it out in the Supreme Court. The season ends with a cliffhanger: Will the court say yes to the Crown? Or will Lord Low succeed in locking his manor gates against prying inspectors?

A shocking turn of events in Season 6 you won't believe. Read it here first: http://themiddleground.sg/2015/08/31/downtown-ahpetc/"

Following the Auditor-General’s report on Downtown Ahpetc’s finances, town criers trumpet key lapses in governance and compliance, including “potential conflicts of interest”. Key stewards, including a married couple, were discovered writing and signing Downtown Ahpetc’s bills addressed to an establishment that they own. Lord Low, Lady Sylvia and the rest of the family face attacks from the Barons’ bloodhounds in Parliament. They maintain that all dealings were aboveboard, no money was lost and that the estate lawn was still being mowed. Again, the country(side) is split. Some were forgiving of the lapses while others ask if Downtown Ahpetc, which had an operating deficit of $2 million, would go bankrupt.

SEASON 3: TOWN VS CROWN

Storm clouds gather over Downtown Ahpetc as it gets a dressing down by the Crown for tardiness in filing important documents and in setting aside monies for future estate maintenance. Crown officials point to reports that were vague about the accounts instead of giving them a clean bill of health. Treasury officials threaten to withhold gold worth some $14 million if Lord Low and his stewards were not forthcoming with documentation. With great majesty and aplomb, the country’s Barons take the case to Parliament. The country(side) is all agog, with some rooting for the former working class family and others decrying the Crown’s high-handed tactics. A key Crown official, the Auditor-General, is directed to inspect Downtown Ahpetc’s accounts.

SEASON 2: LORD LOW UP IN ARMS

Set in the period of the “new normal”, the season showcases Lord Low’s struggles to manage his new estate, as he faced obstacles which he said had been put in place by the former aristocratic owners. Much of the drama was aimed at finding out the truth, with the country(side) thrown into turmoil over the powers of Town versus Crown. Lord Low struggles to collect rent from his tenants; one in three of whom had not been paying their dues. Lord Low, now aided by Lady Sylvia, protests the charges of incompetence, citing teething problems. He later declares the arrears inaccurate. There is a subplot dubbed the Trade Fair Affair, in which Lord Low was fined for holding a fete in the town without Crown approval.

SEASON 1: MAKING OF AN ARISTOCRAT

Broadcast in Singapore from May 2011 to Feb 2013, it recounts the fortunes of the working class Low family which have come into an inheritance increasing the size of its estate manifold. To manage its large landholdings, the family agreed to engage its former stewards for a fee. It saw its chance to expand its estate further when Punggol East was put under the hammer in 2013. After a short and swift battle with an aristocratic family over ownership of the title deeds, the family emerged victorious. It decided to name its estate, which had 206,498 sitting tenants, Downtown Ahpetc. The protagonist was christened Lord Low and given the mantle of Leader of the Opposition.

For FY12/13 : FMSS made a profit after tax of $510,904. This was after FMSS paid its three Owners/ Directors $1,513,199 for their services.

For FY13/14: FMSS made a profit after tax of $2,035,784. This was after FMSS received $3,175,480 for its work.

Between FY12/13 and FY13/14: While FMSS’ revenue increased by 30 per cent in one year, from $6,740,572 to $8,773,429, its profit after tax rose 300 per cent, from $510,904 to $2,035,784.
""Such levels of profit margin are abnormal'', said MND. ""Had the TC not overpaid FMSS, it might well have had been able to break-even.''

""Transport is a challenging ministry. When I first took office, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, in one of our parliamentary sessions, asked to see me. We discussed many things... But then Lee Kuan Yew, at the end of it he told me, Raymond, this is a thankless job. And then in quintessentially LKY, he added, that someone has to do it.

""I think each Transport Minister faces his own set of challenges. When I was Transport Minister, I had a plateful. But when it came to public transport, the principal [issue] was the crowdedness on trains because of the rapid rise of our resident population. The resident population was shooting up. In Tuck Yew’s case, it was train liability… I believe that each Transport Minister... from Yeo Ning Hong all the way to Lui Tuck Yew, tried their level best to deal with the issues at hand.

He said he was pressured to join the Singapore Democratic Alliance in the past but he declined because he wanted WP to forge its own path. He wanted to have a party that would be a credible choice for voters rather than get into a bigger one. Would be interesting to hear more about different objectives of the parties. We suppose some of them want to form the G while WP wants to take a slow approach? Because even if all its 28 candidates win, it isn't enough to deny PAP a two-thirds majority.

Just to recap on candidates and issues: 
Redzwan went quite a bit on his wife's concerns about him entering opposition politics. But it seems his wife, a civil servant, has ""opened up'' about it. We suppose he means reconciled herself with his decision.

Dylan Ng went on how foreigners were taking jobs away from Singaporeans and the need to build a Singapore core. Also complained about high utilities bill for lower income.

Daniel Goh spoke quite a bit about how his background as a sociologist ensured that he could think out of the box. He wants to focus on urban redevelopment and education, especially in terms of empowering the teachers. But we're not clear what he meant by that. 

As for Koh Choong Yong, he was pressed about running in Sengkang West again. He said he would let the party decide....Doesn't this sound familiar?"
337546116346785_672766436158083,"AHPETC saga raised at WP press conf. Seems WP has finished its FY14/15 audit report and will file it soon. So it's going to be on time, that is, end of the month. But Sylvia Lim is not allowing questions on the town council to be posed to new candidates."
337546116346785_672765292824864,"Interesting discussion on the ""fear'' factor and whether Low was playing this up. He doesn't know where reporters got that sense. But he also said some segments of the population could fear repercussions if they vote opposition. (PS. Redzwan had said he feared for his wife because she is a civil servant.) New twist: Low says Sg has moved from climate of fear to more openness...and asks if Sg wants to go back there again."
337546116346785_672764599491600,WP's campaign theme is Empower your future. Low Thia Khiang wants people to take the power to decide on their future into their hands. Says the G has become more responsive because of Opposition. Also says the way WP sees Sg future is not too different from the PAP.
337546116346785_672763112825082,"WP has announced four new faces. So if you count the incumbents, it will have 17 more people to make public. It's fielding 28 people. It hasn't said who is being fielded where. In the line-up is old face Koh Choong Yong who fought in Sengkang West in the last GE. The rest are Daniel Goh, sociologist, banker Dylan Ng and engineer Redzwan Hafidz."

What was suspected to be a part of a wing from a Boeing 777, the same aircraft type as MH370, has been discovered on Réunion, an island off the eastern coast of Madagascar. The plane part has been described to be a flaperon, a moving part of the wing that helps to control the banking or roll of the aircraft. 

Malaysia has sent a team to investigate and Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Datuk Abdul Aziz Kaprawi has said that the debris found is ""almost certainly"" from a Boeing 777. The remains of a suitcase has also been found near where the plane part was discovered. However, it is yet to be confirmed that the recovered wreckage is from MH370.

""But are they really? Or has social media just given everyone their own little platforms? Singaporeans have always been vocal, right from political pluralism during the 'Malayan Spring' in the late 1940s and civil society in the 1950s. One difference between now and then is that people had to be more organised to be heard before the age of the Internet. No coincidence that the formation of the middle class in the 1980s saw the re-emergence of civil society like AWARE and Singapore Heritage Society. So to say that Singaporeans are now more vocal is to be ahistorical.

The Straits Times 18/10/2013

SINGAPORE exports have slipped backwards for the eighth straight month but economists see traces of hope in the latest set of trade numbers.

A sustained slump in electronics exports wiped out the effects of modest growth in non-electronics shipments last month, data released yesterday showed.

But a 1.2 per cent overall dip in non-oil domestic exports (Nodx) last month, from September last year, beat economists' expectations, pointing to a mild export recovery amid improving demand abroad.

A Reuters poll of economists had tipped a far steeper 2.8 per cent slide.

CIMB regional economist Song Seng Wun said: ""It signals a slow turnaround with improving global manufacturing and economic indicators suggesting better days ahead.""

Trade agency International Enterprise (IE) Singapore said electronics exports last month fell 5.5 per cent compared with September last year, largely owing to shrinking sales of disk media products, parts of PCs and telecommunications equipment.

The segment has now shrunk for 14 straight months, noted UOB economist Francis Tan.

But non-electronics Nodx grew by 0.9 per cent in September following a 5.6 per cent slump in the previous month, led by petrochemicals, printed matter and food preparations.

Non-oil re-exports – goods exported from here in the same form in which they were imported – rose 12.7 per cent in September after soaring 14.4 per cent in August. This signals more improvement in overseas demand, noted ANZ economist Daniel Wilson.

Singapore exports last month fell to all its top 10 markets except mainland China, the United States, Hong Kong and Thailand.

But OCBC economist Selena Ling said this is an improvement over August, when eight of the top 10Nodx markets shrank, ""suggesting some tentative signs of a turnaround in some key markets"".

Overall, most economists are expecting brighter days ahead for local exports, with a slow turnaround on the cards. 

""We expect Singapore's export recovery to broaden and gather momentum on stronger global demand,"" said Credit Suisse's Michael Wan.

Exports will also get a lift from factors such as US growth gaining momentum, and yesterday's resolution of Washington's shutdown and debt-ceiling crisis, plus Europe moving out of recession.

But it's not time to start celebrating just yet.

""Weakness in two major industries, electronics and pharmaceuticals, remains a significant drag,"" said Barclays economist Joey Chew.

The Straits Times 19/11/2013

Surprise 2.8% growth in October comes after 8 months of decline

SINGAPORE exports are finally growing again after eight straight months of decline, offering fresh evidence that the overall economy is doing better than expected.

Economists are now even more upbeat that full-year economic growth will beat the upper limit of the official forecast range of a 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent expansion.

Figures out yesterday show non-oil domestic exports (Nodx) grew 2.8 per cent last month from the same month last year – the first positive reading since January. The healthy expansion surprised economists who had been expecting a 1.1 per cent decline.

""It has emerged from a long slumber,"" said Barclays economist Joey Chew. 

CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said: ""It finally turned the corner, but it's still too early to tell if this will be a decisive turnaround.""

Trade agency IE Singapore said yesterday that last month's rise was largely due to a rise in non-electronic shipments which outweighed a slight slip in electronics exports. 

Electronics exports fell 1.4 per cent last month, after declining 5.5 per cent the previous month. October's slide was largely the result of a slump in disk media products, telecommunications equipment and PC parts. 

Although this was the 15th straight month of decline for electronics shipments, UOB economist Francis Tan said the situation is improving as the contractions are getting smaller. 

Non-electronic exports surged 4.9 per cent last month after a 0.8 per cent increase in September, led by pre-fabricated buildings, printed matter and petrochemicals. ""This reflects broader industrial production growth,"" said ANZ economist Daniel Wilson.

Nodx to five of the top 10 markets rose last month.

Yesterday's upbeat export data led economist Chua Hak Bin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch to raise his full-year economic growth projection from 3.5 per cent to 3.7 per cent: ""Growth was initially led by services but manufacturing is staging a more visible recovery. Export performance is also finally turning the corner.""

The bright numbers also set the scene for the release of the preliminary third-quarter economic growth number on Thursday.

Economists expect this to be revised upwards from the advance estimate of 5.1 per cent, largely due to September's surprise jump in manufacturing. ""That will be the icing on the cake,"" said DBS economist Irvin Seah."

""Singapore's Angry Migrant Workers"" (editorial, Dec 28) suggested that 400 migrant workers in Singapore rioted on Dec 8 because of building frustration over their wages and living conditions, yet offered scant evidence for this.

""The rioters were employed by dozens of different employers and stayed in different residential dormitories. The riot occurred on the workers' day off and was localized to a congregation area for recreation. It did not spread to dormitories, workplaces or any other location. It is thus most unlikely that the rioters were motivated by the issues you ascribed.

""The government's preliminary assessment is that they acted spontaneously, triggered by a fatal traffic accident. In any case, a committee of inquiry, headed by a retired judge, will establish definitively the factors that led to the riot.

""Migrant workers do contribute to our economy. They work legally and voluntarily. We strive to ensure that they are fairly treated and properly paid. Laws deal strictly with errant employers who ill-treat employees. Surveys show consistently that the vast majority of our migrant workers want to continue working in Singapore.

""You state that ""the government hopes to increase the overall population from 5.4 million to 6.9 million by 2030."" On the contrary, this was a top-end projection for purposes of long-term infrastructure planning. While we will continue to need migrant workers, especially for construction, we have been tightening the inflow of migrant workers to slow the growth of our population.

""We will treat our migrant workers with respect, but will take firm action against those who break our laws.

ST, predictably, zoomed in on costs. Its headline, ""Steps to curb rising legal costs"", set the story up to be about how the proposed changes would ""help people cope with rising legal costs"" and ""keep justice within reach for all"". Except, of course, the big brother of MSM forgot to say how high such costs were today or how high they had risen, and from when.

TNP's headline: ""Consider settling out of court""; and BT's ""No new Senior Counsel named this year"" were more neutral, or you could say, meh.

The more probing angles were perhaps taken by TODAY and Zaobao. TODAY's report, ""Five-man Court of Appeal being studied: CJ Menon"", zeroed in on how the highest court in Singapore may be presided over by five judges for ""selected cases of jurisprudential significance"" - up from the current three.

This was also the angle taken by ZB, whose headline was: ""Difficult Appeals Cases to be Heard by More Judges"".

Of this move, the CJ said: ""This promises to enhance consistency in sentencing, particularly in relation to offences where there are no useful sentencing guidelines or where there are conflicting authorities.""

Errr... Such as what? Ok, so the CJ probably wasn't taking any questions from the media. But boy wouldn't you like to know?"

""The closure of Breakfast Network’s website demonstrates that regardless of MDA’s stated intent, the registration requirement has chilled and reduced the space for free expression in Singapore. As a regulator tasked with developing the media landscape in Singapore, MDA should consider the substantive impact of its decisions, not just its own subjective intent. Registration requirements can operate to censor free expression as effectively as, and more insidiously than, outright demands to remove content.

""The forms published by Breakfast Network also show that MDA has asked them, if not The Independent, to identify every person who has provided funding to them, as well as every subscriber and advertiser who contributes 5% or more of their subscription or advertising revenue. As we stated previously, these requirements, in particular the former, are overly-intrusive and go far beyond what is necessary to satisfy the stated objective of preventing foreign influence over the media. Even the Political Donations Act, under which MARUAH has been gazetted as a political association and which also regulates political parties, does not require every person who has provided funding to be specifically identified.

""Finally, MDA’s statement raises questions about its inconsistent application of policy on foreign entities in local media, given that Yahoo! Singapore, which is individually licensed by MDA, is a US-owned operation."""

337546116346785_437930852974977,"On the Government's decision to ban the sale of alcohol and invoke the Public Order Act by declaring Little India a ""proclaimed area"" this weekend, Minister K Shanmugam said that these measures were ""foreshadowed"" by reactions from residents in the area.

He said that residents wanted the ban and greater restriction on foreign workers' movements to ensure that the area was protected.

""Residents there wanted steps taken to make sure that there is no repetition, that people don't come back for copycat act."""
337546116346785_437928812975181,"Back to the what the minister described as ""assertions"" by the foreign media that the Singapore system was cracking under societal tensions:

He challenged the news organisations to back up their reports with evidence. And that he would be happy to hear the evidence that the rioters - those who took part in the violence - did so because they were unhappy with their working conditions.

“If there is such evidence, I think we should be told. I haven’t seen any so far.”"
337546116346785_437927076308688,"And what about Singaporeans' reaction to the riot?

The minister said that by and large, the Government's assessment of the public's reaction was that it was one of shock - since nothing like this has happened for more than 40 years. Most Singaporeans, he added, realise that it was a localised incident and that the riot was the result of actions by a small number of people.

""You have some xenophobic trends that are shown online but by and large Singaporeans say they believe that the Government will deal with it and deal with it effectively. And they want us to take firm action against those who have transgressed, and make sure that we proceed firmly."""
337546116346785_437926006308795,"The minister added that a ""dominant strand of thought"" that emerged from the Manpower Ministry's talks with foreign workers so far was this:

""They said, 'look, uh, please leave us alone. In the sense that we haven't done anything wrong. We just want to make sure that we get our contracts done, and extend it as long as possible. Let us make our money. We didn't do anything wrong. Don't tar everyone with the same brush. These are the actions of a small minority.'"""
337546116346785_437924606308935,"Responding to a question by Breakfast Network about his view on how the foreign media has covered the riot, the minister said reports that it was caused by the workers' disaffection against the Singapore system was not backed by evidence.

""Where is the evidence for all of this, that these workers were deeply disaffected, and that is why the riot took place,"" said Mr Shanmugam.

""I'm not saying you can't say it, but I think there should be some evidence to back up a fairly substantive statement like that? All I can say is that it's assertions. And the fact that you repeat the assertion does not make it a fact."""
337546116346785_437923669642362,"Law Minister K Shanmugam speaking to about 250 foreign workers during an engagement session held in an Yishun dormitory this evening. He said so far, most workers he had spoken to had told him they enjoyed working in Singapore. 

He said that in interviews conducted by MOM since the riot, there were four main points that emerged:

One - that the foreign workers had a choice of many places to go, but they chose Singapore.

Two - that they liked to be in Singapore because they can go for skills upgrading, which is not an option in many countries.

Three - that they had no complaints about their dormintories and living conditions. ""In most instances, it is better than what they have at home,"" the minister said.

And four - that the workers knew their rights; that for any employment or payment issues, they know they can seek help from MOM and that action will be taken."

Here's the parting shot from the piece in The Economist: ""Neither the government nor the mainstream media has ventured to draw any link between the sudden display of rage and the dire state of rights for migrant workers. Rioting is not dissent, but the two things often share common cause.""

337546116346785_437025339732195,"ICYMI: Editor's Note

Okay, we are shutting down www.breakfastnetwork.sg. We need to take a breather and re-organise. We are moving back to blogging and putting our stuff on BN Facebook. So you can still find us online, but not as a full-fledged website.

As owner and editor, I can tell you this was a tough decision to make. The site was set up because there were like-minded individuals who wanted to report and write and we thought, what the heck, why not set up something cheap? I also had some undergraduates in my residential college in the National University of Singapore who were keen to contribute. A good chance, I thought, to put my teaching into action so that they can behave like “real’’ journalists. It was also an opportunity to get them involved in other aspects of web publishing if we wanted to grow the site further.

What we didn’t reckon on was that the site would gain fans so quickly, so much so that we had to keep buying more server space.And despite being a pro bono site, there were readers who wanted more and more.So, I thought why not do the site “properly’’, set up a legal entity to do business and pay for a more-or-less proper newsroom operation? As a network, we were determined to marry the best of journalistic practices with the freedom to express ourselves in various ways online. I think we succeeded over the past eight months in getting something good going.  

People have asked us about our shareholders. There is really just one: me. I had a couple of reasons for not taking on more shareholders. I know what it is like to be an editor who has to think about pleasing investors. I thought if I financed everything, I could run everything.That is, I would not have to bother with investors who are not aligned with Breakfast Network vision and wanted the editorial team to do some crazy things,like writing nice pieces for people and companies who want to sponsor us. I also thought I should carry the risk on my own, because everyone, even the Media Development Authority, knows that getting online advertising is tough.

I am beginning to think I was wrong in not getting more financially vested players.

In any case, I got the balling rolling sometime in August. I incorporated a company and started to work on the legal and business end of things while everyone, except for one paid full-timer and a couple of interns, contributed articles pro bono. I had pro bono help from experts. I hired a team to do a new, improved website.

So it was a bit of a surprise to me to get an email from the Media Development Authority about three weeks back about having to register the site. I hadn’t even begun to pull together a business plan to be shown tothe network contributors. 

I suppose the MDA was in a conundrum. First, the Independent and now, Breakfast Network. How to ensure some control over news sites, especially those that haven’t hit the 50,000 visitors mark which would attract licensing? What if there were more clones? What if we get in bed with nefarious foreigners?

The first thing that came to mind was: Did we do something wrong? Which article pissed off who in the G? And, yes, is this a way of saying that Big Brother is watching you? Or were we reading sinister motives into what is really a mundane, regulatory issue prohibiting foreigners with dubious motives funding us? That is, registration is really no big deal.

Of course, we wondered why we were singled out. The G thought the Independent was getting foreign funds, which it has denied, hence the registration demand in July. This area must be entirely new to the G,because it later revised the registration forms which The Independent described as “different in scope’’. Now, with revised forms, the next move, to use a civil service phrase, would be to “regularise’’ everything else, we suppose.

Stupidly, we made the head of the queue because we incorporated a company to run the website.

There was a bout of self-pity. Why us? We are not an advocacy site; we have no ideological underpinnings. We are just interested in news developments and who ask, we hope, thoughtful questions on behalf of the citizenry. We try to get as close as possible to our ideal of a functioning,independent newsroom that upholds journalistic ethics and promotes professionalism.

Of course, bureaucrats will say that we are“mixing’’ the issues. Foreign funding and editorial content are two different things. The first had to do with the need to keep “Singapore politics for Singaporeans only’’.

The second had to do with freedom of expression. The G was quick to say it had never curbed content. I can testify to that. It would be nice if it could sign a declaration that it would never do so, but we are not that unreasonable.

The MDA’s rebuttal to Maruah’s statement that registration might affect the growth of start-ups is quite tragic: “While it is convenient to blame MDA’s registration requirement for causing online commercial enterprises to be unviable, it is also true that many online sites struggle to be commercially viable in the first place.’’

Exactly, MDA. And you just made it harder for Breakfast Network. 

Lawyers and business people who have been shown the forms have described them as “onerous’’. We could declare that all revenue came through bona fide commercial transactions, but we would probably need to produce some kind of proof if queried. So, a kind of compliance checklist to ensure we have done due diligence? BN is not even steady on its feet to start thinking about putting in such administrative structures.

Then there is the wide definition of “person(s)responsible for and/or involved in the provision, management and/or operation of the website” who would have to put their names down. At this stage, BN relies primarily on volunteers. But the MDA has insisted that even pro bono editors had to be named. I cannot compel people to agree. Nor should I. 

From a bureaucratic point of view, everything looks easy. It boils down to this: If you are not receiving dubious foreign funds,why should you be worried?

I think the G should think a bit harder about imposing regulations on this new environment that is called the Internet.

Because some people believe it should remain un-regulated; some think that conceding to one piece of regulation is the start of a slippery slope to push online views into a shape that looks more like the mainstream media. And that is not what people who report and write online signed up to be.

Some people even wonder if this was a way to crimp the growth of a media outfit that could prove over time too big and too difficult to handle if not regulated at its infancy.  
 
The other question we had was: Why now? 

Why not wait for the review of the Broadcasting Act,when any interested party could have a say in the promised public consultation exercise? Who knows, haha, the revised legislation might actually lead to the removal of the need for registration! That was a joke, by the way.

We asked for a month’s extension of the deadline,MDA gave us a week. It did not think a month was required because “the form sare straightforward’’ and it has “clarified’’ the issues. It does not understand that it is not just a question of form-filling but also wrapping our heads around what registration means, really means. By the way, the Independent was first notified in July.   

The demand to register or else - has created a wrinkle in our barely-formed plans to become a sustainable and professional outfit.

Therefore, we have decided to suspend operations until we have re-strategized or at least till the amendments to the Broadcasting Act are unveiled.

Breakfast Network will go back to its original mission: a labour of love undertaken pro bono because we love writing and we think that every citizen should take an interest in what’s happening in their own country. No, we haven’t given up on our vision. We need time to re-group,re-think and re-strategise.

Please go to Bertha Harian and the BN Facebook page from hereafter. We will keep you posted when the kitchen is re-opened. Now,anyone wants to sink $1m in us to retrofit the kitchen and renovate premises?

Must be Singaporean."
337546116346785_437024393065623,"MDA statement:

On 26 November, MDA notified the site-owners of Breakfast Network (breakfastnetwork.sg) to register under the Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification. As part of the registration, they will be required to undertake not to receive foreign funding for its provision, management and/or operation. Such an undertaking will prevent the site from being controlled by, or coming under the influence of, foreign entities or funding, thus ensuring that Singapore politics remain a matter for Singaporeans alone.

The registration of Breakfast Network upholds the firmly-established principle that foreign entities may not engage in Singapore politics or be allowed to control or worse, manipulate our local media platforms, which are prime vehicles for political influence.

MDA had on 6 December extended the deadline for Breakfast Network to register to 17 December 2013, at the request of Breakfast Network. Since Breakfast Network has decided not to submit the registration form, and will therefore not be complying with the registration notification, MDA will require that Breakfast Network cease its online service."
337546116346785_437024253065637,"So... the MDA has released a statement about our decision not to register and it's been picked up by the MSM. We'll post MDA's full statement here so you can read the statement in full.

Since we decided to close the main website, some of you have asked us: What's the big deal, register lah! Our response: It is a big deal.

MDA’s statement makes clear that the driving force behind wanting us to register was to uphold the “firmly-established principle that foreign entities may not engage in Singapore politics... which are prime vehicles for political influence”.

Eh, we not so hard up for foreign funding leh.

Moreover, there were key changes in the registration forms that were sent to us - that are different from the forms available on MDA's website.

For example, point 3 in old forms calls for:

Names and particulars of a member of the Central Executive Committee or its equivalent (“the Principal Applicant”) and at least 5 other members of the editorial team of the group/ organisation/ corporation (all of whom must reside in Singapore) must be submitted in this application. 

Our forms required everyone to be named - including all our volunteer contributors:

Names and particulars of all person(s) responsible for and/or involved in the provision, management and/or operation of the website must be submitted in this application by the class licensee. 

Our form also had two new points, which the old ones don’t have:

All notices and other communications in connection with Forms C and C1 (including the Annexes to Form C1) must be in writing and marked for the attention of the relevant person in charge in MDA. For avoidance of doubt, the class licensee must obtain an official receipt of acknowledgement by MDA as confirmation that any notice or other communication has been received by MDA, failing which the notice or other communication shall be deemed not to have been received by MDA.

and

All information, records, documents, data or other materials concerning or relating to the provision, management and/or operation of the website must be properly kept by the class licensee, and shall be furnished to MDA, as and when required by MDA. 

Oh, and there're seven new pages of annexes attached - which were also not on the old forms.

In the spirit of transparency, we'll upload the forms we've been asked to fill - and you can ask yourself: Would you sign this?"

""One concrete course of action is to find ways to allocate the most talented teachers and school leaders to the most challenging schools and classrooms. PISA also finds that all the highest-performing countries allocate educational resources more equitably among advantaged and disadvantaged schools than the US does.

""In many respects, teachers are the key to success. Top school systems focus on teacher selection and retention, and provide strong pathways for career growth. They also create an environment for teachers to be innovative and share good practices. Instead of requiring standardisation and compliance, top performing systems enable teachers to be inventive; instead of looking upwards in the bureaucracy, they look outwards to create networks of innovation across teachers and schools.''"

Toshi estimates that he can walk up the mountain at 1.5km/h on average, and down at twice that speed. These speeds take into account meal breaks and rest times. Using Toshi's estimated speeds, what is the latest time he can begin his walk so that he can return by 8pm?

Question 3. Toshi wore a pedometer to count his steps on his walk along the Gotemba trail. His pedometer showed that he walked 22,500 steps on the way up. Estimate Toshi's average step length for his walk up the 9km Gotemba trail. Give your answer in centimetres."

337546116346785_422591471175582,"Bertha gave a speech yesterday at a Google conference on marrying old values with new media business. Here is her prepared text. 

Hello there, 

I have five minutes so I will dispense with the obligatory joke. Actually the big joke is that I discovered there was an online world only last year. That was when I quit the mainstream media after 26 years dealing with print journalism. I did so because I had itchy fingers. I wanted to write so badly that I started blogging the day I became unemployed. I started with Bertha Harian, which some of you may know, means The Daily Bertha. And I found I couldn’t get rid of long years of journalism habits – I still keep to housestyle and I want to cry whenever someone spots an error in my post.

Can you keep old journalism practices in the new media? Very tough. Because online journalism is a very shoe-string affair – you don’t have layers of checks, whether for grammar or facts. Most times, your first draft is what goes up. You lack resources to verify facts, which is why for Breakfast Network, the news site I started in February with a  a group of ex-journalists and undergraduates where I teach, tends to rely on professional fact-checkers, that is, traditional media and their legion of paid journalists! Of course, when traditional media trips up, we trip up too.   

It’s also tough because it is so easy NOT stick to journalism standards. You make a mistake, you correct on the spot – and most people are none the wiser. In print, your error survives and your apology is of the most abject kind. It’s a great discipline because how can you credible if you are not even accurate? In the online space, however, you can hide your mistakes easily. People ask for corrections, retractions and think that you’re a bitch when you decide to stick to principles instead of just changing stuff to suit them. They say “Why can’t you just do it? It’s so simple!’’.

Another reason it’s tough – I began very quickly to find that the online world prefers things in black-and-white or rather, there are just two camps – anti-Estab and pro-Estab. There is a tendency to lump writers or commentators in one box or the other. I suppose it makes it easier for others to look at you through just one prism. I have told readers of Breakfast Network that we don’t take any ideological position. We look at every incident, news article on its merits and raise questions about them. We can’t always be full of praise or angrily ranting. It’s ridiculous. So you see, being moderate is extremely difficult. It raises suspicions. 

Then there’s the difficulty of writing online in a way that engages the people online. They don’t like straight-forward reports, they want something “edgier’’ so to speak. They want comment as well, which makes people like me feel very uncomfortable. I am used to the separation of fact and opinion. What is the grey area that is legitimate? I support news commentary would fit the bill – give people facts that they don’t know, need to know or don’t have time to know, put them in context and give a point of view – or at least raise questions. And, hopefully, be entertaining at the same time. My writings in print are very different from my work online, for example. It’s more informal and I make use of plenty of story-telling devices. I really enjoy this latitude. I can write as short or as long as I think the content deserves. I am not stressed out having to fill a certain amount of space.

But as a business? 
Hah. I just got ACRA which is the regulatory authority for businesses here, to approve the name Breakfast Network for incorporation as a company. That’s after close to two months. I was told it usually takes hours or just a week. I don’t know why it took so long because no one would tell me. I suppose it has to do with Breakfast Network being a website that writes about local developments. I was half expecting to be asked to give an undertaking that we won’t take foreign funding ...but so far, nothing. So I suppose I can look for an Arab sheik, a Chinese tycoon or a Malaysian datuk now....or call Jeff Bezos or Rupert Murdoch. I am KIDDING. Or I thought the G, which is what I call the Government, was wondering if they should slap me with something called online licensing. For the uninitiated, this is a regulation which allows someone in some office to decide that you should be licensed because you have a certain number of unique visitors to your site. Oh, and you have to place $50,000 as a bond. The G has helpfully said that it would find a way to help you get the money if you can’t afford it.
I don’t like the regulations because they are not transparent. There are already class licence rules in place that covers all websites, so why this one? In any case, I am waiting to see the amendments to the Broadcasting Act, which I gather will cover websites as well.

Then there is the way officialdom treats online news sites.  We are not invited to their press conferences and even a $50,000 licence doesn’t gain you entry. As far as officialdom is concerned, we do not exist. If we do, it’s as troublemakers drumming away and creating a din.

What about business aspects? Coming from the mainstream media which has a substantial online arm, I know how difficult it is to make money, or rather, as much money as print does in terms of advertising. I don’t expect to get rich doing what I do. In fact, I am spending money rather than making it. Everything is done pro bono but which I hope to change now that I FINALLY have a corporate legal entity for Breakfast Network. I’m just hoping to cover costs, pay for good talent (not just anyone) and maybe on a day far, far away, pay myself too. Breakfast Network is an experiment in forms of journalism; I hope to make it a business experiment too.  
 
Wish me luck."

337546116346785_415175928583803,"Ngiam Tong Dow's ""clarification'' in full. 

From the feedback from friends and colleagues who read my interview published in SMA News, September 2013 issue, it has come to my attention that I had given the wrong impression in several ways.

I had described my discussions with Mr Lee Kuan Yew about the COE scheme as an example of Mr Lee’s openness in discussing policies, even with officials. I realise that my comments might suggest that the COE scheme was implemented to raise funds. That was not the case. The fundamental purpose of the COE scheme was to limit Singapore’s car population. If the intent had been to raise revenue, I would not have supported the policy as Permanent Secretary at the Finance ministry.

I also realise on re-reading the interview that I had not been fair in what I had said about Ministers and discussions in Cabinet. I retired from the civil service in 1999. Since then I have not attended any Cabinet meetings, and have never seen one chaired by PM Lee Hsien Loong. Thus my statement that Ministers will not speak their minds before PM Lee is unfair as it was made without knowing what actually happens at Cabinet meetings today. I have been told by civil servant colleagues that Cabinet discussions are robust — as robust as they were when I attended Cabinet meetings as PS (Prime Minister’s Office), when Mr Goh Chok Tong was PM and Mr Lee Hsien Loong DPM.

I also realise that my claim that Ministers may not speak up because they earn high salaries is illogical. I know that some Ministers have given up high-flying and well-paid careers in the private sector in order to serve the public at a fraction of their original or potential income. Others could have gone to the private sector to make more money but have chosen to be in the public service. They have no reason not to speak their minds when they are convinced that they are doing right by Singaporeans.

I had also said that the current crop of leaders is elitist. I had spoken without realising that many had in fact come from humble backgrounds.

I had the privilege and honour of working with Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr Hon Sui Sen and Mr Lim Kim San. I have said many times that Mr Lee is my hero and that Singapore was lucky to have had such a team to steer it from third world to first. The Cabinet today faces different and less straightforward challenges, having to deal with globalisation and more intense international competition. However, as I had mentioned in my interview, we are starting from a good position — for example, in healthcare, one of the main subjects of the interview."

The Lady on the Lion City
http://www.breakfastnetwork.sg/?p=7861"
337546116346785_408844089216987,"The Lady on the Lion City
by Bertha Henson
 
So, the Lady sweeps into town and we hear her talk about our education system being “workforce oriented’’. Said Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi: “That made me think... what is the purpose of a workforce... of work... of material wealth? Is that the ultimate aim of human beings? Is that what we want?’’
 
Material achievement is important so that there is freedom from want, she said, but values such as love for each other, loyalty and spirituality were what kept her people going through years of oppression.
 
“So there are many things that help us to survive that had little to do with material achievement.’’
 
What a change from reading about foreigners who come over to learn from Singapore and heaping praise on how we work! What a change from reading about how little Singapores were being created in parts of China! Here is someone saying, “Thank you, but no thanks.’’
 
In fact, it is a reflection of our hubris that one of the questions put to her, according to ST, was what she saw in Singapore that she might like to recreate in Myanmar.
 
Her response: “I don’t think 're-create' is the word, 'learn' yes.’’
 
Of course she was polite. “One gets used to thinking of Singapore as a financial, commercial city, where people are more intent on business and money than human relationships, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised that there is a lot of human warmth going round this place.’’ Ouch!
 
As for what Singapore can learn from Myanmar, she suggested a “more relaxed way of life’’. (Oh! Blasphemy!) She also suggested “warmer, closer family relationships’’.
 
We should do some furious thinking and soul searching.
 
Are we just a money-grubbing nation, efficiently churning out digits for the future
workplace? Are we all about the CBD skyline? Is that really how other people see us? As calculative individuals who do not put much stock in human relationships?
 
We can play the finger-pointing game here. But maybe the root of the problem lies far deeper. Yes, we are a nation that survived hard times – but which moved on to being built on the promise of economic wealth rather than social health. Our relentless pursuit for the good life has become so natural that we aren’t even conscious of it.
 
Here’s one example. In my past life, there was an American journalism consultant who came to Singapore to look over the content of our newspapers. What he said surprised those of us who were in charge of putting the day’s news. He said The Straits Times was all about numbers, especially dollars and cents. Fees, cost, price, salaries, discounts, premiums, investment, household income, bonus, credit, subsidy, scams, indices, stocks seem to dominate all areas of coverage whether education, transport, health, sports – not just business news.
 
He asked if Singaporeans were interested in nothing else. Because the image to foreigners from reading the media is that the country is all about materialism and money. Then the news editor, I was taken aback at his remarks. Yes, there always seemed to be an instinctive need to suss out the “accounts’’ of anything, so to speak. It became so that dollar signs also dominate headlines, never mind that the amount is insignificant to the matter at hand.  
 
What about religion, he asked. With so many temples, churches and mosques, people must be interested in religious issues as well.
 
So we took a stab at covering religion. Quite tentatively, because ST is a secular paper and would not want to be seen as favouring one group over another. Still, quite naturally, articles would veer into the dollars and cents type of stories – remember Ren Ci? St Teresa? Now City Harvest?
 
Maybe we’ve forgotten how to report on the softer, spiritual side of life. Or maybe the media is merely a mirror of society, reflecting what citizens care and talk about. Money.
 
Now we seem to be taking steps to get back to the heart of who we are or want to be. The Our Singapore Conversation series concluded that we (too!) want a “more relaxed way of life’’ with more opportunities and chances to level up. We’ve come to realise too that the good life is more than just about money.
 
The fear, of course, is that we will move from being a hard-charging nation pounding the economic treadmill to being happy enough at walking pace. That is, we will move from one extreme to another, forgetting that, unlike Myanmar, we are a very small country that can be easily be overwhelmed by forces outside our control.
 
Can we find a happy mean?

by Ng Yi Shu

What’s the difference between biryani and beriani?

Besides the spelling – apparently a lot. This was a classic Indian dish with “many stories, many geographical and cultural interpretations”, which was why social activist Adrianna Tan decided it would be the perfect starter for her new project, Culture Kitchen.

Aimed in part to address the rising anti-foreigner sentiment in Singapore, the project’s first event, “Biryani/Beriani”, was held on Sunday at the Artistry gallery and cafe in Jalan Pinang near Kampong Glam. Ms Tan said she decided to feature South Asians and the South Asian migrant worker community first because of how she loved South Asian culture.

“Growing up amongst a lot of Indian Singaporean and Indian expatriate friends gave me a closer understanding of the culture,” she said, adding that she hoped the project will come to include “every form of migrant work community”.

“As a Chinese-Singaporean, it’s easy for me to go ‘I don’t know about them’… I want to create a counter-movement that is positive and welcoming… One that says ‘Thanks for coming (to our country)’.”

The free event on Sunday attracted more than 130 people who queued up for a taste of briyani – from the dum biryani of Pakistan, to the Malay-style chicken briyani. Singaporeans and other expatriates attended the dinner too – though, they had to pay $5 for their meal.

For the next few hours, amid mouthfuls of steaming rice and meat, the workers mingled among themselves and the other diners, exchanging stories of their past, and how they came to find work in Singapore.

Ms Tan, 28, whose day job is head of business development at an online media company, said she is already planning to organise the next event – “It’s a toss-up between the Finnish and Romanians.”

Social media in particular helps little to alleviate this circumstance, as it possibly obscures truth - if it ever exists - by allowing people, ""if (they) so choose, (to) happily inhabit worlds of our own creation where the only voices we ever hear are those that we already agree with.""

This does not mean that all hope is lost however. He urged the soon-to-be graduating audience to ""face uncertainty with a stoic and pragmatic scepticism rather than with false optimism""; to ""console (themselves) with the thought that if anything is possible, then too nothing is impossible"".

337546116346785_395787607189302,"Interesting ST interview with political scientist Kenneth Paul Tan today. Published in ST and also available in Singapolitics - We've picked the interesting stuff for you.

His views on...pragamatism

I've been writing about pragmatism, which has served us well in the past. The argument I make is that this has degenerated a little over time. It's no longer about experimentation or a nimble approach to decision-making.

Instead, pragmatism has been almost reduced to an approach hardly capable of questioning the long-term goals, but is focused on working out the technical means of achieving them. Vulgat pragmatism mechanically calculates based on material costs and benefits. It loses its recourse to values and ideals. We've become so technically sophisticated that we no longer want to or know how to think in moral, philosophical and aesthetic terms.

His views on ...LKY's assertion that Singapore is destined for mediocrity if Singapore became a two-party system.

We know what the arguments are. They usually have something to do with Singapore being a small place with limited leadership talent, and therefore we can't afford to split the talent.

But another argument relevant to Singapore is the need to have a system that can adapt.

So if you have one party in power, and that party is highly successful over time, you put a lot of trust in it, and that party may also have a lot of trust in itself.

But later on, when circumstances change, they may make a wrong decision, and we go very far down that path. Let's say, as a result of that, it crumbles, the party loses credibility, and everything is possible, from voting it out to revolution. What's going to take its place? There's no leadership or organisation that is ready. It's not resilient. That, to me, is a good argument for guarding against a bad future.

Built in the 1977, Queenstown Cinema and Bowling Centre housed modern facilities which few could match in Singapore. There was a cinema (with two halls), a bowling centre, fast food restaurants and private karaoke lounges. The 18-lane bowling centre and the 1715 seat cinema were favourite among residents in Queenstown and students from the secondary schools nearby. Queenstown Cinema simply could not compete against bigger multiplexes operated by Golden Village or Cathay and was finally closed in 1999.

Queenstown Bowling Centre was officially opened in 1976. It was situated at the heart of the estate which contained an emporium, two cinemas and other recreation facilities. The 18-lane bowling alley was also a favourite among the young and the trendy in the estate as many residents would try their luck for strikes and turkeys. The bowling alley was finally shuttered in 2000 after public interest in the sport waned and died out.

The entire building complex was bought over by a private developer with demolition starting on June 12. The building was supposed to be cleared by mid July. This photo taken on August 11 shows all that remains of the complex after the demolition crew were done with their work. It is unknown what is to become of the site once it is finally cleared.

""Home""

Whenever I am feeling low
I look around me and I know
There’s a trade that will keep its value
Wherever I may choose to go
I will always recall the haggling
Count every cent and more
I’m sailing the river which brings high growth
Winding through all Singapore

Chorus:
This is home, truly, where I’ve parked my money
Where my debt waits for me, where the mortgage always flows
I own property, and my bankers tell me
Just as long as I pay my loan,
I’ll always have a place called home.

When there are troubles to go through
I’ll flip my flat and start anew
There is comfort in the knowledge
HDB keeps its value too.
So we build our homes closer together
Hoping the prices soar
You know what they say about land and growth:
They ain’t going to make any more

( Repeat Chorus )

For this is where I know it’s home
Where I am owned by what I own

Our BN writer gets up close and personal with the producer of SteadiProductions, Ying Quan to understand their motivations for creating this year's theme, how their production process was like, what their experiences were.

https://www.facebook.com/SteadiProductions

Q: What inspired your latest National Day video?

We came up with the concept of filming different people and their experiences because we want to make it relatable to all Singaporeans. I think the inspiration came after we reflected on what the Singaporean experience was and we realized that it is really the people that we should focus on, and not just the places.

We had many objectives. First, we hope that people who have watched the video will be able to find their own reasons to come home , be reminded to appreciate the beautiful things around us and not be lost in their tasks.

Also, we wanted to showcase more of our own local talents!

Q: Were there any memorable moments in the production process?

I think one of the best moments was when we were at Gardens By The Bay. Gardens by the Bay graciously gave us the permission to film a string quartet performance (Fete Musicians) inside the flower dome. That film shoot happened during the haze period but inside the flower dome and it was absolutely amazing…The air was fragrant, chilly and clean, and the entire dome was just captivating! For most of us, it was our first time entering the flower dome too! Perfect place to go during the haze season.

Q: What has the response to your video been so far?

The response has been great! Many viewers told us that they loved both the video and the song. There were also a couple of overseas Singaporeans that commented on how this song touched their hearts so much that it made them tear too…

337546116346785_393267280774668,"Here's another thoughtful poem on 9th August by a reader and guest columnist.

9th August, 2013

 “Transboundary smoke haze from land and forest fires during the traditional dry period between June and October has been a recurrent feature (for) decades.” – Meteorological Services Singapore

Late in the morning, the city begins to fade, filling
the sky with lost buildings. From our height, only ceilings
mark the earth’s edge – all else is dust, rising light.
This happens without notice: no cough of wind,
quickening chill, or ounce of clear before clouds roll in.
Only august sun and the thought of rain, which arrives
tepid, thick. At evening they will fly our flag above
an invisible city. Make out the roads from our cars,
tracks from trains, towards where the towers glint
like so much glassware, candescent as day, candles
on an empty table. They will avoid the missing blocks
which we have lined red and white for good measure,
steer blind across vanished reservoirs, find wind
by children’s kites. They will weave between malls
where there are gaps like bad teeth, scrape old,
absent walls, to the city’s tall heart. There we will be,
first unseen, then impossible to miss, unfazed,
forgiving, expectant. We know what comes after:
as it is each year, songs played to passé, the feel
of the field. But soon it will fall to us to remember,
from a different distance, this geography. To keep,
in warmed hands, on the furthest of days, other fires
on other islands. The possibility of haze.

337546116346785_392395174195212,"You've seen the edited version on Readers' Post, now here's the unabridged version:

Congratulations to The Straits Times for initiating Tell Me ST and appointing a Readers’ Editor to give answers to readers who might be puzzled by its news reports.

We are members of Breakfast Network, a website that, among other things, seeks to clarify mainstream media reports for our readers on a near-daily basis. We have been doing so since February, asking questions which we believe the mainstream media should have asked of newsmakers or to point out contradictions in reports within articles, or among the publications in Singapore.

Most recent examples on The Breakfast Network include the conflicting newspaper court reports on the death of the prison inmate, the question of why ST deemed the nationality of the SMRT bus driver in a crash so important as to give it such prominence in a Page 1 story and why ST, unlike its rival TODAY, ignored the public disquiet over National Geographic’s stunt to promote a documentary about the Singapore Armed Forces.

Some of our members are ex-journalists, including myself, who know enough of the difficulties of putting out a newspaper on deadline and the intricacies that go into editing a national paper such as the ST. We recognise the difficulty your Readers’ Editor will have in sifting out questions from readers and deciding which to respond to. 

Doubtless, there will be some who will view the choices made as a mere sop to readers and accuse you of ignoring more difficult questions that might embarrass the newspaper. 

Still, it is a good start on the road to advancing media literacy and a sign that ST is willing to engage with readers including, we hope, those who hurl more brickbats than bouquets at your work. 

The Breakfast Network is committed to helping raise the standard of journalism in Singapore and providing our online readers a moderate perspective on happenings in this country. From now, we will be sending our articles to your Readers’ Editor, in the hope that you will shed some light on your editorial decisions.

Bertha Henson
Editor
The Breakfast Network"

Moody’s, a ratings agency, recently downgraded its outlook on Singapore’s banks from “stable” to “negative”. Mr Menon asserts that Singapore bank lending is still “mostly prudent”. But he also acknowledges that with so much demand for borrowing, “there is some laxity creeping into the system.”

Clean ceilings saga - the PM has spoken, and Bertha Henson weighs in.

EXCERPT:

""Critics of WP will surmise that it has something to hide. That it condones having “shady people” people in its ranks. Supporters will say the WP was merely trying to defend its staff from attacks. People in the middle might well say that the WP thought it was right to defend its staff, kneejerk and is now embarrassed to be caught short. An investigation might well open up another can of worms for the PAP to, errrm, feast on.

What would be WP’s motivation for launching an investigation? Well, clearly, hawkers in its ward seem angry; they are a huge constituency and probably influential voters at the grassroot. Placating voters with a clear explanation, and even an apology if needed, is good politics. Sure, the PAP would be laughing away but even the PAP knows that a “sorry” can go a long way in making people happy.

More importantly, the WP should come up with its code of conduct for the running of town councils, whether it be on separation of political duties and paying jobs. This would avoid the perception that jobs are being parcelled out to cronies, rather than people of merit. (Unless of course, the residents are perfectly okay with party members being rewarded with paying posts, especially if other people with better qualifications for the posts balk at being associated with an opposition party).""

Like that how???

Read on: http://www.breakfastnetwork.sg/?p=6131

EXCERPT:

""... So it could be that the G’s expectations of journalistic standards in the blogosphere are too high. A journalist’s job is to get answers, but the amateur can only raise questions. The next step is then how to raise questions or give feedback on what people are talking about, without being shot down? Go through Reach? Private channels? Hmm… But why? If there is nothing to hide, then correct misconceptions and reply. As robustly as you want. The blogosphere should be thick-skinned enough to take it and not look at tough responses as the G clamping down on dissent.

But what is not right is to take critical citizens to task by asking if they had the solution to a problem. This is a tactic that is often used on members of the Opposition when they get critical about G policies. The G response: You’ve got a better idea? If not, sit down and shut up.

In the past, the Opposition used to argue that it didn’t have the resources and manpower available to the G in the form of the civil service. Which is true. Another argument was that its role was to question the G, not to come up with policy options. Which is lame. Well, if you form an opposition party, you must want to do more than question the G, you should want to form the G! Unless, of course, the citizens and civil society groups are too lame to get their voice heard on their own. The good thing is that opposition parties have recently been coming up with their own policy options – so the citizenry can have a choice of routes to embark on rather than to stick to just one roadmap.

But to have that pot shot “where were you and what were you doing’’ directed at citizens is simply not on. That is a question that citizens should be asking of members of the G, not the other way round. Dr Yaacob pointed out, the Internet was rife with people seeking to do good. And several bloggers themselves rallied others to do good. But that is the point, isn’t it? The G wants people only to do – and not ask. How can this be?""

337546116346785_379551962146200,"A Bigger Pink Dot on the Little Red Dot

by Kwan Jin Yao, Tan Pei En and Salima Nadira

FIVE years ago, a group of people wanted to make a big splash for the gay community. Hong Lim Park was a good venue. But they decided against the usual rally or a demonstration with placards, opting instead for a fun-filled gathering of the like-minded. Pink Dot was born and it got bigger and bigger every year. 

Last night was Pink Dot’s fifth outing, and the crowd was more than a dot in the park. Last year, the park packed in 15,000 of those who belong to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community and their supporters. This time, the organisers are claiming a crowd size of 21,000, a feat even if several thousands were subtracted from the figure. 

It was a sea of pink on the green. Beyond the usual pink tee-shirts, there were pink skirts, tights, shorts, hats and even wigs. Pink picnic mats. Pink balloons. Pink candy floss. Whether straight or gay, most heeded the colour code of the carnival which started way before the official starting time of 5pm. Some came with bottles of champagne.

A smattering of families were there. Couples hauling children. Babies in prams. People could be heard conversing in different languages. First-time attendees included university students Zheng Jia Hui and Xin Chen who enjoyed the festive atmosphere but thought the venue was “too small’’.

Some foreigners had come to Singapore specifically for the event, like Eduardo Palacio from Colombia. He was touched by the promotional video directed by Boo Junfeng, because it emphasised the elements of allies and the family. Associate Professor Michelle E. Bloom from the University of California, Riverside, arrived in Singapore earlier in the day after attending a research conference in Kuala Lumpur. She wanted to be part of the “great stuff that was going on”.

It was not just bigger but grander. A concert at the park’s amphitheatre instead of the regular make-shift stage. About 100 volunteers to act as “greeters”, man the first aid station and hand out paraphernalia. Thousands of torchlights with pink cellophane  paper prepared for what would be the finale - pink lights illuminating the green. 

Like last year, white marquee “community’’ tents had been set up as well. They were bigger because this time, 21 groups including more than half which are support groups for those in the community had been invited. Among them: Purple Alliance, Sayoni, SG Rainbow and Singaypore.sg, OogaChaga and Singapore Transgender Alliance. 

Perhaps, the more elaborate display had to do with the corporate sponsors which the event organisers had scored, including Google, which agreed to come on board just three weeks earlier. Pink Dot’s spokesman Paerin Choa said the array of sponsors, which included Barclays and J.P. Morgan, showed that the the event has become “more mainstream” in corporate eyes.

He also told Breakfast Network that the three event ambassadors who endorsed “the freedom to love”, were chosen deliberately.

Actress Michelle Chia was invited as a “straight ally”. Addressing the crowd, she called for a more advanced, equal, and forward thinking Singapore. Her ambassadorship “does not make me a bad role model”, she said, as she lashed out at netizens who had criticised her endorsement of the event. 

DJ Mark Richmond was presented as the family guy. “As a parent, I want my son to grow up learning to accept and appreciate this unique and brilliant diversity we often take for granted here in Singapore,” he said. “Children do not look at this world with prejudice and discrimination. Why do we as parents choose to colour their world with the discrimination we are exposed to?”

Ivan Heng, the Artistic Director of theatre company W!ld Rice, talked about growing up as a gay man and stressed the importance of “standing up against discrimination and prejudice”.

There were no angry speeches, no rants against the Government, no indignant exclamations. Instead there were concert acts including a capella, cheerleading and dancing performances. The crowd sang along with singers who performed popular pop tracks like “Girl on Fire” and “We Are Young”.

If there was a political tone injected, it was the presence of Gary Lim and Kenneth Chee as the Pink Dot flag-bearers for the night. Images of the gay couple - who had challenged the constitutionality of the controversial Section 377A criminalising gay sex - were also projected on the huge screens. Certainly, it was a less-than-subtle reminder of the perceived discrimination against gay men. 
    
The carnival culminated in the iconic light-up moment, as guest singer Dick Lee presented a special rendition of “Home”. As pink lights sparkled under the moonlight, the crowd chorused: “So we’ll build our dreams together; just like we’ve done before.”

337546116346785_379138502187546,"[BN Special] EXCLUSIVE interview with Foreign and Law Minister K. Shanmugam - Seeing through the haze in Asean

[EXCERPT]

""Mr Shanmugam, who is also Singapore’s Law Minister, has asked the Attorney-General to look into steps which Singapore can take to rein in Singaporean companies engaged in errant practices abroad. He declined to give details but said that the AG has “an outline of the things we can do”. Which is well and good, except that Indonesia has yet to convey the names of Singapore companies engaged in the burning and the evidence to go with it.

One good sign is that Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudoyhono appears to be conciliatory towards Singapore’s concerns. Mr Shanmugam described the Indonesian leader’s apology as a “symbolic powerful act of statesmanship”. Yet he too has to contend with the “multiplicity of views” in Indonesia, he said , referring to criticisms by other Indonesian politicians.

The next step then must be action to accompany the Indonesian leader’s statement that efforts will be made to douse the flames and bring perpetrators to book. So far, manpower and fire-fighting equipment have been deployed to the burning forest.

So will more action be taken soon? Action that goes beyond putting out the fires and amounts to a longer-term solution? If Asean can work out a solution, can the international community play a part?

“There are limits to what the international community can ask any sovereign country can do,” Mr Shanmugam said.

“And that is something we have to understand, our geography. Where are we… Means that what happens in [the] region affects us. But there are limited possibilities for us to do much about what happens in other countries.” ""

""This small country is tied to its neighbours both politically and economically. And our big neighbours know that. That’s why they can throw their weight around.

Yet shout and scream we must lest we seem too easily bullied. But shouting and screaming must be accompanied by strength, whether it is a strong armed forces or hefty reserves that can see us through crises. The inconvenient truth is that the haze has shown us how vulnerable we are to the vagaries of nature, the vicissitudes of the global economy – and the varying responses of regional players. It has become so that others can even utter that we should be glad, and even pay? – for the oxygen we breathe. Can you ever imagine Singapore saying something like that to anyone?

Here’s what their  Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Jero Wacik said today: “Let me remind our friends from Malaysia, Singapore, don't just because of the haze, tell stories to the world. It's called sharing, you go through good times together, don't make noise to the world when things go bad. It's just like husband and wife, don't take your quarrel outside."" 
Seems like our little signal that we might take the issue to other forums have rattled them a bit. But hey, what to do? We tried to do it bilaterally and we get called “children’’. Now we’re husband and wife? Then we tried to talk within Asean, and Jakarta has the distinction of being the only Asean country which did not ratify the transboundary haze treaty.
Oh. For good measure, he talked about how Malaysia benefited from electricity imports from Indonesia and Singapore gets gas from them. Gas, as in the useful kind. 
He said Singapore and Malaysia should “tahu diri’’ – or know themselves. Well, we think we do. And we think they don’t.  
Also, it is curious how the named companies are either Singapore-owned or Malaysian-owned, according to the Indonesians authorities. 
Environment Minister Balthasar Kambuaya said plantation companies have often ordered local people to burn forest or peatland near their concessions, hoping that the fire will spread onto their land. “Once the fire takes hold of their concessions, the companies shift the blame onto the local residents as if the fire had accidentally and spread to their land,” he said. 
Such evil people these companies are….They should be roasted over a slow fire.  
Both Malaysia and Singapore have told the Indonesians: Please, go deal with them. Under its environment laws, the penalties for causing illegal forest fires are a maximum of 10 years in prison and fines of up to 5 billion rupiah (US$504,000). So far, two arrests – of individuals - have been reported. 
Thing is, the haze is an annual affair, which means many, many people or companies should have been netted by now. So how many have gone through the fires of a court trial and paid the price of jail time or fine? 
Anyway, what’s the use of trading barbs? Show us the maps (updated ones please), show us the evidence so we too can deal with errant companies.
As for how Malaysia and Singapore aren’t helping to resolve the matter, as alleged by a minister, this is unbelievable!  The people of Singapore would be furious if its Government hasn’t tendered help to solve a problem that is affecting our economy and more importantly, our health."

Dear __________(fill in according to your religion)

Please send us rain.

This is surely not the end that you envisaged for the millions of souls on this tiny island. First, a plague of mosquitoes and now, smoke.

Our leaders say there are enough masks to go around. Which means we will have to venture into the open to find one to put on. We can no longer recognise our beautiful clean and green city. Which means we will lose our way unless we have GPS.

We have been told to stay indoors, preferably in air-conditioning. We will do as we are told, especially since public transport is unreliable. We do not want the torture of being stuck in a train tunnel for an hour or so.

I think we need to look again at ourselves before casting further aspersions on the S.League. Yes, attendances have gone down and it is quite the different animal from our Malaysia Cup exploits. But do we need to wait till clubs go knocking on our doors to come to stadia?

As an aside, I would like to point out that average attendance this season seems to have gone up somewhat, the first two weeks have seen an average of 1659 spectators per game. Inflationary measures have helped, and it must be said many of these were probably not paid tickets, but eyeballs are eyeballs.

I would like to ask Mr. Lim, being myself of the Fandi-inspired generation - do you remember the times out on the terraces at Kallang, queuing overnight for Cup seats and stomping our feet while sitting out on damp wooden benches or yelling WE WANT GOAL at the top of our lungs? I sincerely hope you do, because the Malaysia Cup magic was more than just complementary grandstand tickets - it was crowds thronging the stands, queuing for toilets at half-time (OK, so I exaggerate.), and not minding overpriced Pepsi or keropok because - GOAL!

Yes, those were the days we had heroes. Fandi Ahmad, Abbas Saad, Alistair Edwards, Jang Jung, the late Borhan Abu Samah, Kadir Yahaya, Rafi ""Red Card"" Ali, Nazri Nasir, ""Own Goal"" Lim Tong Hai (sorry lah!), Zulkarnaen Zainal with his free kicks, Saswadimata Dasuki on the wing, the list goes on. Many of them have gone on to training the next generation, with varying amounts of recognition, gratitude and success.

But are we as willing to give our local boys a chance now?

Shahril Ishak, before he was Captain Silkpro, was a terror for Home United down the wings. Shahdan Sulaiman in midfield for Tampines Rovers, Shaiful Esah at wingback for SAFFC, Sufian Anuar growing into his role at Home United before maturing at LionsXII, the talent is there. Delwinder Singh and Patrick Paran for Tanjong Pagar United, Andrew Tan at Balestier Khalsa... but I digress. A lot of it, sadly, is insider information. (Disclosure: I have been writing with sleague.com and more recently, footballopod.com for some time now.)

The debate of the day seems to be over how Aleksandar Đuric and Mustafic Fahrudin, Daniel Bennett, Qiu Li and Shi Jiayi are *ugh* foreign imports who we desperately rely upon for success, somehow forgetting that we used to call them 'stars' rather than 'crutches'.

And conveniently, the local boys that grew alongside, because or despite of them - Baihakki Khaizan, Khairul Amri, Safuwan Baharudin, Aide Iskandar, S. Subramani, Noh Alam Shah, Hariss Harun - are dropped by the wayside, mere collateral.

The S.League has potential to give us nine times as many heroes to follow as did the Malaysia Cup team. Yet, hungry for pre-made celebrities, we followed the Les Ferdinands and Alan Shearers, Fandi's contemporaries, through to the Wayne Rooneys and Steven Gerrards of today, shunning our local stars-in-the-making.

Does the S.League need to have World Cup-calibre stars for it to be considered worthy of our attention? Maybe, in this on-demand age of Starhub vs Singtel, I guess. Why make a trip to a local football stadium and pay a pittance to enter when you're already paying monthly - through the nose, I might add - anyway to watch what you want when you want?

""Fans are the lifeblood of any soccer team. If no one cares to watch a game, and no one supports a team, a league loses its relevance,"" writes Mr Lim. Of course this is true. But should we need free tickets, half-time performances from half-hearted cheerleaders, teams knocking on doors and offering free McDonalds' food or nasi lemak before we deign to drop by a stadium for two precious hours of an evening?

Like Mr Lim, I think Balestier's outreach initiative is a step in the right direction. But I doubt its necessity. As much as clubs should be reaching out to find new supporters, we should be willing to give it another go.

""Now if it really wanted to save the S-league, why did the FAS decide once again to send a team to compete in the Malaysian League? Surely, it realised that the LionsXII would steal the attention and lure the best players away from the S-league?"" asked Mr Lim.

I wondered the same thing at first as well, and resented the instant surge of publicity all media lent - and continue to lend - the LionsXII. Why has this not been seen in the S.League for ages? Because sponsors are companies, not charities. It is not such a simple proposition, to support a team and to publicise it - it is an investment on the part of the sponsor, financially or otherwise.

Mr Lim also asserts that the LionsXII ""can draw upon patriotic fervour. We want to see our boys kick the asses of the Malaysian state teams, something our S-league clubs cannot be counted on to do.""

I must mention, somewhat apologetically, that the likes of Balestier Khalsa and Geylang International have recently locked horns with Malaysian ""state teams"" and come off looking pretty decent. Tampines Rovers, SAFFC and Home United have represented Singapore in regional competition, and invited teams from around the region - clubs from Philippines, Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia - have fallen to local clubs as well. Has this somehow escaped the writer's notice?

The tired argument that ""Singapore is just too small for so many teams"" deserves to be put to rest. Even if we can only muster 300 passionate supporters for each S.League team, it is a start that can help to draw casual fans to the grounds.

Supporting a football team has nothing to do with size or location. Ask the Super Reds, who before their omission from the S.League, had expanded from their Korean support base and were considering making further contributions to local football. Ask Albirex Niigata (Singapore), who were given a patch in Jurong East vacated by a Jurong FC led by V. Sundramoorthy (gasp! Malaysia Cup!) and grew their own support base over the ten years they have been here.

Yes, the Japanese guests have been here ten whole years and are still, as it were, alive and kicking. Did they complain that the Japanese community here was too small? No, they set about impressing and working hard, and won the locals over. Perhaps drawn by novelty and retained by consistency, the locals have got behind them as well.

If one believes that ""tribal rivalry"" cannot develop in a ""homogenous (sic)"" landscape, then what of Manchester United vs Manchester City? Liverpool vs Everton? Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal, Fulham, Crystal Palace? These intra-city rivalries surely have something more than geographic or demographic diversity to them. I submit that it is in part the unquestioning loyalty of (perhaps more than) a few that keep the flag flying.

Mr Lim, I would like to ask if you have ever been to a Hougang United match. I hesitate to even draw tenuous links with the ""Hougang identity"" and the support for the football team - one of the most vocal and motivated supporters in the Hougang HOOLs lives in Clementi!

I accept the notion that there's not enough ""tension"" in the S.League, but it is not because geographical reasons are not enough to whip fans into a frenzy. It is because we Singaporeans have learned not to care less.

Why should one pay to watch long balls punted about on muddy pitches when for that dollar one already pays, one can admire how Cristiano Ronaldo's hair stays gelled in place as he weaves his way through an entire defence, with or without the ball?

Because if tomorrow Singapore were to disappear, Real Madrid would lose thousands of fans, but that would be a temporary setback if at all. However, there would be nobody left to remember Fandi's legacy at Geylang United, the national players grown from our Young Lions squad, and how the likes of Aide Iskandar and V. Sundramoorthy have made the transition from player to manager.

Because we need to get behind our S.League, and it is only with our investment of passion that local football can return to its glory days."
