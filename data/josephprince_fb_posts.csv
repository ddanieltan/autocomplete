102470493134142_999742423406940,"Governor Sarah Palin recently released a devotional titled, ""Sweet Freedom."" In it, she mentions my teaching in her discussion on James 2:24 which says, ""You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.""

Here is an excerpt from Day 200 of her devotional:

""Wait a minute! That verse just contradicted 'justification is by faith alone'! ... It's easy to go there with confusion over theology, so it's great to have charismatic, knowledgeable preachers with platforms who set us straight... [Joseph Prince] explained that James 2 isn't talking about justification before God, but of man... The Apostle Paul teaches us that God isn't impressed with man's works... This blows the earthly minds of people who've had holier-than-thou upbringings, people who have been fed guilt and condemnation because they've believed it's all about how good and holy they are… Christianity accepts us as we are, flaws and all, so says Romans 4. That's not Joseph Prince's opinion—it's gospel.""

My dear friends, that is indeed the gospel. It is all about our Lord Jesus' finished work at Calvary and not about our own efforts to become righteous. Righteousness is a gift— you received it the moment you received Jesus as your Lord and Savior. The good fruits and evidence of your righteousness in Christ will then overflow into every aspect of your life. That is indeed our #SweetFreedom found in Christ. Praise the Lord for His unmerited favor towards us!"

When faced with a problem or challenge, do you find yourself asking, ""What do I do?"" Many of us usually try to use our smarts, experience or resources to find a solution.
 
Today, God wants you to know that when you “stand still”, He takes over.

Jesus sees the cares you carry in your heart. He knows the worries you have for your family and for the future. And He wants to give you rest today. The way you find rest for your soul is to be yoked with Him, for His yoke is easy and His burden is light. 

When a pair of oxen is yoked together, the younger ox just follows what the lead ox does and in this way, learns what it needs to do. Likewise, all you have to do is to follow God’s leading and flow with Him. 

God will not lay anything heavy on you. Ask Him to come into your career, family and relationships. You will find Him leading you to do the right thing at the right time, prospering all that you put your hands to."

“Sit” is a picture of rest. What God is saying to us is to stop worrying and struggling, and to start resting and believing in His love for us. 

Instead of being conscious of your challenges, choose to be conscious that God is bringing all your enemies under your feet because of Jesus’ finished work on the cross."

When faced with Goliath, the Philistine giant, the Bible tells us that all the men of Israel were terrified. So how is it that David, a young shepherd boy, could confront the giant fearlessly? 

Well, unlike the others, David wasn’t conscious of how huge Goliath was. Instead, he was conscious of how great God was, and God caused this giant to come tumbling down! 

My friend, have David's spirit when you face the giants in your life today. Whether they are giants of condemnation, sickness or debts, don’t focus on how big they are. Be conscious instead of how big your God is and how infinite His resources for you are!

Declare victory in spite of what is happening because Jesus has defeated all your giants. And before your very eyes, you will see them fall, one by one!

A must read for anyone who has been told the lie that salvation can be lost.""

Not just in the big things, but also in the little things! Many years ago when Wendy was pregnant with Jessica, she and I were in a restaurant for dinner. As we were about to order our food, a man seated not too far away from us took out a pack of cigarettes and prepared to light up. I really didn’t want Wendy to take in any secondhand cigarette smoke, but there was no non-smoking section in that restaurant. So I prayed. Under my breath, I told the Lord, “Lord, I know that I am Your beloved. Please stop that man from smoking in this restaurant.” That was all I said—a quick and simple prayer. And guess what happened? That man tried to light his cigarette, but his lighter just wouldn’t work! He kept trying, but no matter what he did, the lighter simply would not work. After some time, he shoved his cigarettes back in his shirt pocket in frustration. I want you to know that even in the little things, God hears and answers your prayers because you are His beloved. Nothing is too big or too small for your Daddy God. If it matters to you, it matters to Him. The more you are conscious of the fact that you are His beloved, the more you will walk in His unmerited favor in every situation! http://josephprince.com/"

102470493134142_630697813644738,"When the Pharisees brought the woman caught in adultery to Jesus, they reminded Him of the law, saying, “Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?” (Jn 8:4–5). They thought that they had succeeded in trapping Jesus because if He told them to stone her, then they would accuse Him of not demonstrating the forgiveness and grace that He had been preaching about. If He were to say that they should not stone her, then they would accuse Him of breaking the law of Moses and bring a charge against Him. Now, adultery is a sin, and Jesus had every right to say, “Stone her!” But knowing that He would soon hang on the cross and pay for the woman’s sin in His own body, Jesus was able to uphold the perfect standard of the law, love the sinner and silence her accusers. And He did all three in style with just one sentence—“He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first” (Jn 8:7). Demonstrating His infinite wisdom and grace, Jesus simply challenged the person who was perfect before the law to cast the first stone. Pricked by their conscience, the Pharisees who had come to ensnare Jesus began to walk away one by one, completely silenced. Once He was alone with the woman, He turned His attention to her and with eyes full of love and compassion, He asked, “Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?” She answered, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.” Beloved, today the Lord offers you the same gift of no condemnation. He can because He has already paid for all your sins at the cross. This gift will empower you to live a victorious life, one that glorifies Jesus. Will you receive His gift today?"

This servant arrived at a well outside the city of Nahor in the evening and decided to stop there. There were so many young women gathered to draw water there that he did not know who would be the right woman for Isaac. So the unnamed servant prayed this prayer: “O Lord God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.” Now, the word “success” here is the Hebrew word ""qarah,"" which means “to encounter, to meet (without prearrangement), to chance to be present.” In a nutshell, it means “right happening.” The servant essentially prayed, “Give me a right happening this day.” With the Lord’s positioning for right happenings or ""qarah"", the servant found a beautiful and virtuous woman named Rebekah, who became Isaac’s bride. Beloved, what is it that you need today? Well, you can pray for ""qarah"". In whatever assignments, appointments or errands you have to attend to today, ask the Lord to show you kindness and give you ""qarah"".

As we wandered along the bank of a river, we stumbled upon a majestic tree anchored by the water’s edge. Its trunk was sturdy and strong, and its branches stretched out to form a perfect canopy above it. The tree was constantly nourished by the river and in contrast to the other trees that were further away from the river, its leaves were refreshingly green and luscious. Looking at that tree, I couldn’t help but recall the blessed man described in Jer 17, and I remember saying to myself then, “I am like this tree because I am blessed in Christ!” Beloved, when you depend on and place your trust in Jesus instead of yourself, your qualifications, your looks or even your circumstances, you will be like this beautiful and majestic tree!

The first is to depend on and trust entirely in the Lord’s unmerited favor, while the other is to depend on your self-efforts to strive for success. If you depend on your self-efforts, you will most likely end up stressed and may even experience poor health. But God’s ways are higher. The Bible tells us a day in God's courts is better than a thousand (Ps 84:10)—one moment spent in God's loving presence gets us further than one thousand days of striving. When you depend on Him, He will cause you to not only accomplish much, but be relaxed, have time to spend with your family and experience divine health. So beloved, I encourage you to choose God’s way. In all that you do, place your trust not in your efforts and your abilities, but in His unearned and undeserved favor that is upon you, and watch Him bring you to a place of good success that no amount of self-effort can ever achieve! http://josephprince.com/"

Jesus came as Immanuel—God with us. Do you know that He is with you today, never forsaking you for even a moment (Heb 13:5–6)? And when the Lord, with His saving power, unfailing love, divine wisdom and limitless supply, is with you today, how can you not have all that you need? How can what you touch not prosper? And how can any weapon formed against you prevail (Isa 54:17)? My friend, step with boldness into the abundant life Jesus came to bring you, knowing that He is with you today!"

Not an easy task at all! Moses had been a great leader and left big shoes for Joshua to fill. Yet, Joshua managed to lead the people into their promised land. What was Joshua’s secret to good success? Well, the Bible tells us that he meditated on God’s Word day and night, and God caused all that his hands touched to prosper. Beloved, have you been given new responsibilities at work? Are you feeling the weight of expectations on you? Why not open your Bible, pick a scripture and start meditating on God's promises throughout the day?

""Goshen"" means “drawing near.” Your heavenly Joseph—Jesus—wants you to have an intimate relationship with Him. God is not a God who is distant and far away. He is a God who never leaves you nor forsakes you, and He wants you to come and talk to Him about anything and everything. The more you practise His presence, the more you'll see Him provide for you.

Can you recall how old she was then? She was 65 when Pharaoh desired her, and 90 when Abimelech wanted her! My friend, these were heathen kings. I am sure that it was not because they were captivated by her inner or spiritual beauty. God must have literally renewed her youth physically! Beloved, God’s Word promises a literal and physical renewal of your youth and strength. This means that if you are tired and you need more strength, God renews the strength of your physical body and causes you to have energy like that of a teenager’s! If you need help remembering things, He improves your memory and boosts your mental performance. If it is health that you need, God can also cause every organ in your body to function at its peak!

102470493134142_617616871619499,"In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.—1Jn 4:10 Years ago, I was the president of a youth ministry and I used to preach to the youths, “You’ve got to love God! You’ve got to love the Lord with all your heart, all your mind and all your soul!” Yet I was wondering to myself, “How in the world do I do that?” I didn’t know then that I was actually placing my youths under the law because the sum total of the law is to love God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind and all your strength (Deut 6:5). You see, my friend, no one has been able to love the Lord with all his heart, soul and mind. But our Lord and Savior Jesus went to the cross to die for us. With arms outstretched, He loved us with all His heart, all His mind, all His soul and all His strength. Under the law, it is all about our love for Him. But under grace, it is all about His love for us. We love because He first loved us! Rest easy in His love for you today. When you do, your response will be to grow in your love for God. http://josephprince.com/"

Eventually, an officer on board told us, ""Don't look at the choppy waters around you. Look far away where the horizon is and you will feel better."" We took his advice and certainly felt better. Like the horizon, God's love for you is fixed and constant. On the other hand, our love for God is like the waves, variable and unpredictable. Some days, it’s high, and on other days, it’s low. Beloved, if you believe your security depends on your love for God, you will always feel you are on shaky and unstable ground. But if you know and believe your security is based on God’s constant, unfailing love for you, you’ll become bold and unshakable. So focus on God’s love for you today!

And the word “bruise” there in Hebrew is to “crush.” When I first read it, I couldn't understand that! I told the Lord: I know You gave us Your Son, but how can You say that it pleased You to crush Him? I got my answer a few days later when I brought my wife and daughter to the mall. At the end of the shopping trip, my wife and I had our hands full with shopping bags and Jessica was tired. So I picked her up and she immediately fell asleep. While carrying my daughter on one arm and trying to balance the rest of the bags in the other, I realized that it was quite a distance to the parking lot and my arm was beginning to go numb! Yet, I couldn’t bear to put her down and wake her up because I love her too much. As my hand went to sleep, the next trial—pins and needles—came on me! Beloved, right there and then, I realized what God meant when He said that it pleased Him to crush His Son. I would rather “crush” my arm than wake my daughter because I love her.

Not a single one of them died though they murmured. And that is a picture of pure grace.” When I heard that, I turned to the Bible feverishly to check—as if to prove to God that someone did die! Until then, I had never heard anyone preaching about this! And indeed, I could not find any record of anyone who died before the law was given at Mount Sinai. You see, God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt and provided for them, not based on their goodness, but based entirely on His goodness.

I believe that the same request that pleased the Lord then still pleases Him today. No wonder the Bible tells us that wisdom is the “principal thing” (Prov 4:7). When we have wisdom, all the things we seek will follow after us, including honor and length of days. So beloved, ask God for wisdom today!

102470493134142_600561959991657,"Beloved, today, when you are caught in a situation and you don’t know what to do, who do you look to? 

Joseph in the Bible knew that God was the source of his wisdom. When Pharaoh said, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream, to interpret it,” Joseph immediately replied, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace” (Gen 41:15–16).

Have you noticed that Joseph was not looking to himself to provide an answer? He was looking to the wisdom of God. When Joseph gave Pharaoh the interpretation, Pharaoh saw that the Spirit of God was in Joseph and that there was none who was as wise and as discerning as Joseph. And Pharaoh placed Joseph in charge of the whole of Egypt (Gen 41:38–41). 

Today, stop looking to yourself for the answer. Ask the Lord for wisdom. The Bible tells us in James 1:5 that if any man lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach. Beloved, Jesus is the source of your wisdom and the answer to every difficult situation you face.

102470493134142_599611430086710,"…""My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.”…—2Cor 12:9

Do you know that God loves to use weak, insignificant things and people? I remember how I was a stutterer in high school. I had serious trouble getting words out of my mouth. But after I surrendered my weakness to the Lord, something supernatural happened. I stopped being conscious of my stuttering and it supernaturally disappeared.

In my area of weakness, God supplied His perfect strength. Now, seeing how God is using my mouth—what used to be my main weakness—to bring life transformation and miracles, I feel humbled because I know what I was like before God touched me.

Beloved, when you look at yourself today and see your weaknesses, don’t get discouraged! Know that as you depend on God’s grace, He can and will supernaturally transform these weaknesses into strengths. When people look at you and see the transformation in your life, they will know that it is indeed the Lord and He gets all the glory!

In our lives today, there are many legitimate things for us to be concerned about. But there is one thing that Jesus wants us to attend to. And that is to sit at His feet and receive from Him.

Like Martha who was only concerned about doing and serving, when we fail to do that one thing needful, we’ll end up bitter and troubled about many things. On the other hand, when you, like Mary, do that one thing that is needful, you’ll end up restful and filled with the fullness of Jesus.

Beloved, it is only when we first receive from Jesus that we are able to give to others. So do that one thing that is needful today—rest at Jesus’ feet and receive from Him!

You might be wondering what the judges saw in this. But give the winning canvas a closer look and you would see that tucked away in a crevice of the cliff was a family of eagles snug in their nest. The eaglets were safe under the shelter of the mother eagle’s wings. 

This is the kind of peace that Jesus gives to you and me! Peace is not the absence of trouble, but the presence of our Savior, Jesus, even in the midst of a storm. Right now, even if you are in the midst of a crisis, receive His peace that surpasses all understanding, and let His loving presence calm every storm in your heart.

Do you know how the enemy tries to defeat you today? He comes roaring at you, telling you that God is angry with you! He also uses the law to show up your failures, to give you a sense of guilt and condemnation. 

Beloved, Jesus has defeated the devil at the cross, taken all the condemnation for your failures and qualified you to receive all of God’s blessings. Rejoice, for the roaring lion has been de-fanged, and he has no more power over you!

Beloved, do you know which name of God Jesus came to reveal? It is the name “Abba,” which in Hebrew means “Daddy.” 

When my daughter, Jessica, was younger and had nightmares, all she needed to do was to cry out, “Daddy! Daddy!” And in a heartbeat, wherever I was and whatever I was doing, I would drop everything and rush to her side to hold her, comfort her and if there was really a monster under the bed…that monster would be dead!

102470493134142_590760320971821,"Ruth in the Old Testament was possibly at the lowest point in her life just before she met Boaz. All the natural factors were against her. She was a poor widow and a Moabitess—a Gentile in the Jewish nation of Israel.

But she trusted God for favor when she went looking for a field to glean in. She said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field, and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I may find favor” (Ruth 2:2).

Noticed what Ruth was conscious of? Favor! She wasn’t conscious of her natural circumstances that were against her. And because of that, her situation was turned around completely. 

The Bible tells us that she happened to come to the part of the field that belonged to Boaz. And to cut the long story short, Boaz saw Ruth, fell in love with her and married her.

Beloved, when you approach your situation today, be conscious of the Lord’s favor that is all over you! His favor will cause you to be at the right place at the right time, and say the right things at the right time, turning the negative situations in your life around and giving you good success!

102470493134142_590188524362334,"Hope is a beautiful word in the Bible. It is defined as a ""favorable and confident expectation of good to come"". This means that when you hope in the Lord, there is joy in your countenance. Simply put, there is a smile on your face! It is the confident assurance in your heart that, bleak as the circumstances may appear to be, God is working behind the scenes, turning things around for your good! (see Rom 8:28)

This is so contrary to the way the world defines hope. We say things like, ""I hope things turn out alright"", or ""I hope I'll get the job"", and it seems oft to connote doubt and uncertainty rather than surety. But my friend, that is not Bible hope! The hope we have in Jesus is a hope that is certain and sure! It is founded on the love of a perfect God, who will never leave us nor forsake us! If God is with us, then whatever the situation, it is not over yet!

So put a smile on your face today! You can have a confident expectation of good because you have a good God who loves you and will never leave you in the lurch! This is the 6th key in The Power Of Right Believing. #believing4"

Self occupation is the reason for many of our failures and defeats. When people become overly occupied with self, they become excessively introspective about their performance, inner motivations and how other people view them. This inevitably leads to them being obsessed, oppressed and depressed. 

My friend, stop looking at yourself today! Stop dwelling on negative thoughts about yourself and feeling lousy. Turn your eyes away from you, and look at Jesus. Be utterly absorbed and engrossed in all the beauties of the One who loved you and gave His life for you! As you do that, you will find peace, freedom and rest for your weary soul.

It is when you start believing these thoughts, that he has succeeded in trapping you in wrong believing. 

The key to winning the battle for your mind is to ignore these thoughts and start focusing on what Jesus has done for you.

I have received many testimonies from people who were able to quit their addictions effortlessly as they leaned on Jesus’ favor and confessed their righteousness in Him. One lady told me how she kept confessing her righteousness in Christ, even as she reached for her cigarettes when the compulsion hit her. Some time later, she noticed that she seemed to have “forgotten to smoke.” Since then, she has been completely delivered from her smoking addiction.

Beloved, whatever addiction you are facing today, believe and declare that even right there in the midst of your struggle, you are still righteous in Christ. The more you receive God’s abundance of grace and His gift of righteousness, the more you will reign over every addiction.

Beloved, have you ever wondered what was it about Joseph that made him successful? The Bible says that even when he was a slave in Egypt, with not a cent to his name, he was a successful man.

Just like Joseph, because the presence of Jesus is with you, you are already a success.

So he kept waiting there, hoping for a miracle. Then one day, he encountered Jesus who met him at the point of his need and healed him completely.

They end up buying things that they don’t need to impress people who don’t care! This erroneous mindset leads to the destructive habit of folks spending beyond their means, and landing themselves in a debt cycle. Beloved, being caught in this destructive habit and the debt cycle is not God’s heart for His precious children. Let’s understand that having more things doesn’t complete us. Only Jesus can fill that vacuum. So find your security and completion in Christ. You already have a treasure in you, One far more precious than anything money can buy. Anchor your security and identity in Jesus and delight yourself in Him alone!

One of my favorite stories in the Gospels is of Jesus healing a woman bowed over with a spirit of infirmity for 18 years. Imagine never being able to see the sky or rainbows, but only the dust of the earth and the grubby feet of people—what a painful existence she lived! 

I love how Jesus saw this woman and immediately called her over to receive a miracle from Him. When Jesus said to her, “Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity,” He was proclaiming liberty over her and setting her free from that crippling condition. He laid hands on her and she immediately received her healing. 

Beloved, you too have already been set free from the curse of sickness by Jesus’ finished work at the cross. Believe it and proclaim your liberty won by His one perfect sacrifice!

In the verse, the word “salvation” is the Hebrew word Yeshua, the name of Jesus. So God will satisfy you with a long life that is full of Jesus and His grace! 

Chronic illness, depression and a short life are not, and will never be, part of God’s plan for you. He wants you to experience a long, full life in which you walk in all the blessings of health, wholeness, provision, peace and joy that He has given you through Jesus! Amen!

What God wants today is for you to draw from Him—from His fullness, riches and abundance. It is God’s delight to respond to your needs.

When Jesus came to Mary and Martha’s house (Lk 10:38–40), Martha served Jesus, attended to His needs and made sure He was comfortable. Yet the Bible says she was “distracted with much serving”. 

Mary, on the other hand, simply sat at Jesus’ feet and listened to His Word, and what did Jesus say? That Mary had “chosen the good part”.

God wants you to choose “the good part” today. He wants you to come expectantly to Him for your needs today. See Him ready to pour His abundance out for you. See Him rejoicing when you call upon Him. 

As you see His heart of love that always wants to give to you, you will find the provision that you need—be it finances, healing or restoration—manifest!

When faced with a problem or challenge, do you find yourself asking, ""What do I do?"" Many of us would usually try to use our smarts, experience or resources to find a solution.
 
So what did the people of Israel do when they found themselves being pursued by the mighty armies of Egypt? Moses simply told them not to fear, but to stand still and see God’s salvation. And when the people of Israel stood still, God made a way out for them in what seemed like a dead end!

God wants you to know that when you “stand still”, He takes over.

Jesus sees the cares you carry in your heart. He knows the worries you have for your family and for the future. 

And He wants to give you rest today. The way you receive rest is to be yoked with Him, for His yoke is easy and His burden is light. 

When a pair of oxen is yoked together, the younger ox just follows what the lead ox does and in this way, learns what it needs to do. Likewise, all you have to do is to follow God’s leading and flow with Him.

It’s interesting to see how God never despises the little things.

When the boy brought his five loaves and two fish, the disciple Andrew scoffed, condescendingly patted the boy on his head and said to Jesus, “What are they among so many?” In direct contrast, God did not despise the boy’s small lunch.

So don’t despise the little things that you have right now. See them as your very own “five loaves and two fish” even when people around you mock and belittle you. Learn to disregard such people and lay your little before Jesus. While you and I have no power to multiply, Jesus certainly does!

Beloved, whatever you are building right now in your career, ministry or business, don’t despise the day of small, humble and seemingly insignificant beginnings. Involve Jesus and allow His provision of favor, wisdom and power to multiply and grow the little things in your hands.

I love how our Lord Jesus is such a loving and practical God. When there is a problem, He goes straight to the solution! Before Jesus stepped in to heal the man born blind, his disciples were caught up in uncovering whose sin had made the man blind. Jesus, on the other hand, was interested only in using His power to give the poor man sight! The same way Jesus didn’t get sucked into the “blame game” is the same way He doesn’t want you to. So don’t ask what or whose sin caused your sickness. Forget about what you should or shouldn’t have done or why it happened.

Haman, the villain in the story of Esther, hated the Jews and sought to exterminate them. He succeeded in getting a decree issued to annihilate all the Jews in one day. 

But God used Queen Esther and Mordecai, both Jews, to turn the tables on Haman and save their people.

Haman was hanged, while a counter-decree was given that allowed the Jews to defend themselves and destroy their enemies in one day. And so, God turned what had begun as an evil day for the Jews into many good days. He turned their mourning into rejoicing and gave them victory over their enemies.

God can do the same for you today. He can turn the tables on your enemies and turn your sadness into joy! Simply rest in Jesus’ finished work at the cross, which has set you above every evil assault the devil attempts to throw at you, and watch your evil day turn into days of rejoicing!

The apostle Paul tells us in 2Cor 8:9 that for our sakes Jesus became poor so that we through His poverty might be made rich. At the cross, Jesus took on all our sin and poverty. He was humiliated, spat upon and stripped naked. The Roman soldiers even gambled for His clothes.

The One who fed more than 5,000 people, gave fishermen a net-breaking, boat-sinking load of fish, and who placed the gold, diamonds and rubies in the earth, took your place of poverty at the cross, just so that you can take His place of abundance. A divine exchange occurred at Calvary—your sin for His righteousness and your poverty for His provision.

My friend, Jesus is the reason you can be the head and not the tail, above only and not beneath. He is the reason you can be blessed to be a blessing. Put your trust in His presence in your life and what His finished work has accomplished for you!

Beloved, God is not out to get you. He knows all about your sins and still loves you—He sent Jesus as the payment for your sins. He says to you, “Don’t be afraid, I will surely show you kindness. I will restore all to you and you shall always eat at My table!” http://josephprince.com/"

So when trouble comes, don’t give up and say, “It is hopeless!” Don’t worry or get angry. See that trouble as an opportunity for God to bless you with more than what you originally had. Because God has declared it, be confident that you will get double for your trouble!

102470493134142_491755897538931,"Surely He has borne our griefs (sicknesses, weaknesses, and distresses) and carried our sorrows and pains [of punishment], yet we [ignorantly] considered Him stricken, smitten, and afflicted by God [as if with leprosy]. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our guilt and iniquities; the chastisement [needful to obtain] peace and well-being for us was upon Him, and with the stripes [that wounded] Him we are healed and made whole.
—Isaiah 53:4–5, AMP

Isaiah 53:4–5 is proof forevermore of the Lord’s love for you and His desire for you to be whole.

How important is your healing and health to Him? It’s so important that He Himself paid the heavy and terrible price for your wholeness.

When Mel Gibson’s The Passion Of The Christ was released, people complained that the scourging scene was too graphic and violent. The truth is that it portrayed only a fraction of what our Lord really suffered on our behalf.

Jesus was violently scourged beyond human recognition by the Roman torture equipment. His flesh was shredded to the point His bones were exposed, starkly white amidst the blood and torn muscles.

He bore the stripes so that we don’t have to. His body was broken so that ours can be whole, and by His stripes, we have been healed. Keep meditating on this powerful truth and see His healing and divine health manifest in your body!

Are you in a situation today where no matter what you do, things aren’t getting better? 

Beloved, the Lord has said that His strength is made perfect in your weakness. This means that when you say, “I can,” God “cannot” in your life.

So turn to Him and say, “I cannot,” and watch as His “I can” flows mightily into your situation to save you, and empower you to do what you cannot do.

102470493134142_487943261253528,"…when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side.”… And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling…Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace, be still!” And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.—Mk 4:35, 37, 39

Before Jesus and His disciples set out to cross the Sea of Galilee in their little boat, He had already told them, “Let us cross over to the other side.”

That was why even amid a great storm in the middle of the sea, Jesus could still sleep peacefully. Our Lord had a plan, and nothing could disrupt it!

Though tired from a long day of teaching and ministering, Jesus’ love for His terrified disciples caused Him to arise and calm the storm. “Peace, be still!” He said, and immediately, the turbulent waters became as smooth as glass, and everyone made it safely to land.

Beloved, if you’re grappling with a challenging situation right now, take heart. The Prince of Peace resides in you, and has a plan of peace and hope for you (Jer 29:11). No matter how bad the storm is, you are not going under, but going over safely to the other side!

Well, unlike the others, David wasn’t conscious of how huge Goliath was. Instead, he was conscious of how great God was, and God caused his giant to come tumbling down! 

My friend, have the Davidic spirit when you face the “giants” in your life today! Whether they are giants of condemnation, sickness or debts, don’t focus on how big they are. Be conscious instead of how big your God is and how infinite His resources for you are!

What situation are you faced with today? Instead of looking at how insurmountable your challenges are, I encourage you to turn away from them and keep your eyes on Jesus.

Many years ago when Wendy was pregnant with Jessica, she and I were in a restaurant for dinner. As we were about to order our food, a man seated not too far away from us took out a pack of cigarettes and prepared to light up.

I really didn’t want Wendy to take in any of that secondhand cigarette smoke, but there was no non-smoking section in that restaurant. So I prayed. Under my breath, I told the Lord, “Lord, I know that I am Your beloved. Please stop that man from smoking in this restaurant.” That was all I said—a quick and simple prayer.

And guess what happened? That man tried to light his cigarette, but his lighter just wouldn’t work! He kept trying, but no matter what he did, the lighter simply would not work. After some time, he shoved his cigarettes back in his shirt pocket in frustration.

I want you to know that even in the little things, God hears and answers your prayers because you are His beloved. Nothing is too big or too small for your Daddy God. If it matters to you, it matters to Him. The more you are conscious of the fact that you are His beloved, the more you will walk in His unmerited favor in every situation! http://josephprince.com/"

102470493134142_484097091638145,"When the Pharisees brought the woman caught in adultery to Jesus, they quoted the law to Him, saying, “Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?” (John 8:4–5). 

They thought that they had succeeded in trapping Jesus because if He told them to stone her, then they would accuse Him of not demonstrating the forgiveness and grace that He had been preaching about. If He were to say that they should not stone her, then they would accuse Him of breaking the law of Moses and bring a charge against Him. 

Now, adultery is a sin, and Jesus had every right to say, “Stone her!” But knowing that He would soon hang on the cross and pay for the woman’s sin in His own body, Jesus was able to uphold the perfect standard of the law, love the sinner and silence her accusers. 

And He did all three in style, with just one sentence—“He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first” (John 8:7). 

Demonstrating His infinite wisdom and grace, Jesus simply challenged the person who was perfect before the law to cast the first stone. Pricked by their conscience, the Pharisees who had come to ensnare Jesus began to walk away one by one, completely silenced. 

Beloved, 1 Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Jesus “became for us wisdom from God,” and because you are in Him, the same wisdom that Jesus has is available to you! Begin to see yourself in Christ, who is always flowing with divine wisdom, always in control, and the same wisdom that flows in Him will flow in and through you. Depend on Jesus’ wisdom to succeed and you will see whatever you do prosper.

102470493134142_339385849513771,"The Importance Of Right Believing

When things go wrong in our lives, we often ask the question, “What did I DO wrong?” We believe that something we did brought about the bad thing that has happened. Granted, there are consequences to our actions, but what brought about those actions in the first place? It’s our beliefs!

So the question we should really be asking is not, “What did I do wrong?” but “Where have I gone wrong in my believing?” 

Discover how when you know the truth and believe right, you will live right, experience freedom from bondages and walk in the blessings of God!

Yet, the Father was well pleased with Him.

Beloved, today, your Father in heaven loves you the same way. Because of Jesus’ perfect finished work on the cross for you, the words that the Father spoke over Him at the Jordan River are the very same words He is speaking over you right now! 

Your Father’s love for you is not dependent on your qualifications, your looks or your achievements. His love for you is unconditional. He delights in you before you have even done a single thing right! 

So take some time to meditate on this thought today: “I am my Father’s beloved and He is well pleased with me!” Know that as you go about your daily activities, He is smiling at you with delight in His eyes! http://josephprince.com/"

102470493134142_482878075093380,"Then he said, “O Lord God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.”—Genesis 24:12

In Genesis 24, we read the account of Abraham sending his unnamed servant to look for a bride for his son, Isaac. This servant arrived at a well outside the city of Nahor in the evening and decided to stop there. There were so many young women gathered to draw water there that he did not know who would be the right woman for Isaac. So the unnamed servant prayed this prayer: “O Lord God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.” 

Now, the word “success” here is the Hebrew word ""qarah,"" which means “to encounter, to meet (without prearrangement), to chance to be present.” In a nutshell, it means “right happening.” The servant essentially prayed, “Give me qarah this day.” With the Lord’s qarah or positioning for right happenings, the servant found a beautiful and virtuous woman named Rebekah, who became Isaac’s bride.

Beloved, what is it that you need today? You can pray for qarah. In whatever assignments, appointments or errands you have to attend to today, ask the Lord to show you kindness and give you qarah—success. Believe that Jesus, your good shepherd, is leading you to step into every provision and blessing you need. And like Abraham’s servant, you shall experience divine success in all that you do! http://josephprince.com/"

Beloved, God wants you to know that He is your God of divine happenings. He will place you at the right place at the right time, where you will meet the right people and do the right things!

This means that if you are looking for a job, He can cause you to meet someone who will open doors of opportunities for you.

Years ago, while I was on vacation with Wendy in the breathtaking Canadian Rockies, we spent time soaking in the splendor of our heavenly Father’s creation. As we wandered along the bank of a river, we stumbled upon a majestic tree anchored by the water’s edge. Its trunk was sturdy and strong, and its branches stretched out to form a perfect canopy above it. 

The tree was constantly nourished by the river and in contrast to the other trees that were further away from the river, its leaves were refreshingly green and luscious. Looking at that tree, I couldn’t help but recall the blessed man described in Jeremiah 17, and I remember saying to myself then, “I am like this tree, in Jesus’ name!” 

Beloved, when you depend on and place your trust in Jesus instead of yourself, your qualifications, your looks or even your circumstances, you will be like this beautiful and majestic tree! Jesus will cause you to be a picture of robust strength, vitality and good success. So keep looking to Jesus, and you will see His unceasing blessings in your life!

Joshua was appointed the new leader of Israel after Moses died and he was to bring God’s people into the Promised Land. Not an easy task at all! Moses had been a great leader and left big shoes for Joshua to fill.

Yet, Joshua managed to lead the people into their promised land. What was Joshua’s secret to good success? Well, the Bible tells us that he meditated on God’s Word day and night, and God caused all that his hands touched to prosper. 

Beloved, have you been given new responsibilities at work? Are you feeling the weight of expectations on you? Why not open your Bible, pick a scripture and start meditating on it throughout the day?

In the Old Testament story of Joseph, after he revealed himself to his brothers, he told them to dwell in the land of Goshen. ""Goshen"" means “drawing near.” Your heavenly Joseph—Jesus—wants you to be in a place of nearness to Him. 

God is not a God who is distant and far away. He is a God who never leaves you nor forsakes you, and He wants you to come and talk to Him about anything and everything. 

And when you draw near to Him, He will provide for you. Like how Joseph’s brothers were provided for in the land of Goshen, you will receive abundant provisions and protection! 

Beloved, even in the midst of a financial famine or perilous circumstances, there is safety and protection for you.

My friend, these were heathen kings. I am sure that it was not because they were captivated by her inner or spiritual beauty. God must have literally renewed her physical youth!  

Beloved, God’s Word promises a literal and physical renewal of your youth and strength. This means that if you are tired and you need more strength, God renews the strength of your physical body and causes you to have energy like that of a teenager’s! If you need help remembering things, He improves your memory and boosts your mental performance. If it is health that you need, God can also cause every organ in your body to function at its peak!

Years ago, I was the president of a youth ministry and I used to preach to the youths, “You’ve got to love God! You’ve got to love the Lord with all your heart, all your mind and all your soul!” Yet I was wondering to myself, “How in the world do I do that?” 

I didn’t know then that I was actually placing my youths under the law because the sum total of the law is to love God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind and all your strength. (Deut 6:5) 

You see, my friend, no one has been able to love the Lord with all his heart, soul and mind. But our Lord and Savior Jesus went to the cross to die for us. With arms outstretched, He loved us with all His heart, all His mind, all His soul and all His strength. 

Under the law, it is all about our love for Him. But under grace, it is all about His love for us. We love because He first loved us! Rest easy in His love for you today! http://josephprince.com/"

One day, as part of my training in the navy, I found myself on a boat in choppy waters. Less than half an hour into the journey, you could see all the rookies looking unwell and feeling nauseous.

Eventually, an officer on board told us, ""Don't look at the choppy waters around you. Look far away where the horizon is and you will feel better."" We took his advice and certainly felt better.
 
Like the horizon, God's love for you is fixed and constant. On the other hand, our love for God is like the waves, variable and unpredictable. Some days, it’s high, and on other days, it’s low.

Beloved, if your security depends on your love for God, it’ll be shaky and unstable. But if it is based on God’s constant, unfailing love for you, you’ll become unshakable.

Did you have to work for your forgiveness or did you simply receive it because of Jesus’ work on the cross? If the greatest gift of salvation came to us completely free by His grace, how much more every other good thing in life? 

Today, don’t look at your performance to decide if you are deserving of Jesus’ blessings and favor in your life. It is not about you or your works. It’s all about Jesus and His work.

102470493134142_477654665615721,"I love the story in the Bible about the woman caught in adultery, because I love the way our loving Savior, Jesus, responded to her. He looked tenderly into her eyes and asked her, “Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?” She looked around and said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.” (Jn 8:10–11). 

Notice how Jesus first gave the woman the gift of no condemnation, and then told her to go and sin no more. That there, beloved, is the key—the power—to stopping the cycle of sin in your life! Receive the gift of no condemnation from Jesus!

Now, let me make this clear: Jesus is NOT, in any way, condoning the woman’s sin. He gave her the gift of no condemnation because He knew that He would be paying for every iota of her sin, guilt, shame and condemnation with His own life at the cross. This is grace, my friend. This is His unmerited favor! 

The law says, “Go and sin no more first, then God will not condemn you.” Grace says, “I have already taken all your condemnation on the cross. Now, you can go and sin no more.” http://josephprince.com/"

Have you ever read Isaiah 53 about the sufferings of Jesus? It says, ""it pleased the Lord to bruise Him."" And the word “bruise” there in Hebrew is to “crush.”

When I first read it, I couldn't understand that! I told the Lord: I know You gave us Your Son, but how can You say that it pleased You to crush Him? 

I got my answer a few days later when I brought my wife and daughter to the mall. At the end of the shopping trip, my wife and I had our hands full with shopping bags and Jessica was tired. So I picked her up and she immediately fell asleep. 

While carrying my daughter on one arm and trying to balance the rest of the bags in the other, I realized that it was quite a distance to the parking lot and my arm was beginning to go numb! Yet, I couldn’t bear to put her down and wake her up because I love her too much. As my hand went to sleep, the next trial—pins and needles—came on me! 

Beloved, right there and then, I realized what God meant when He said that it pleased Him to crush His Son. I would rather “crush” my arm than wake my daughter because I love her. God allowed His Son, Jesus, to be crushed because He so loved us! http://josephprince.com/"

When I heard that, I turned to the Bible feverishly to check—as if to prove to God that someone did die! Until then, I had never heard anyone preaching about this! And indeed, I could not find any record of anyone who died before the law was given at Mount Sinai. 

You see, God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt and provided for them, not based on their goodness, but based entirely on His goodness. Similarly, because we are under the new covenant of grace, God’s blessings and provision for us are based not on our performance, but entirely on HIS goodness! http://josephprince.com/"

When something is given, it can be sent from afar. But when someone comes, it speaks of relationship and of drawing near! 

My friend, the greatest gift came to us when Jesus Himself stepped into the world to reveal the fullness of God's grace!

He saw first-hand how a revelation of God’s grace turned him into the effective and hardworking apostle that he was (1 Corinthians 15:10).

What we really need is not more “self-help” but the Lord’s help! 

Beloved, I’m not against the pursuit of knowledge. However, natural wisdom can only yield natural results. But when you look to God for His divine wisdom, you’ll surely see supernatural results!
 
Is there an area in your life today where you haven’t seen any breakthroughs? Ask God for wisdom! The Bible tells us that in Jesus “are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” for our success (Col 2:2–3). As you look to Him and draw on His divine wisdom, you will surely see divine success in all that you do!

Joseph in the Bible knew that God was the source of his wisdom. When Pharaoh said, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream, to interpret it,” Joseph immediately replied, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace” (Gen 41:15–16).

Have you noticed that Joseph was not looking to himself to provide an answer? He was looking to the wisdom of God. When Joseph gave Pharaoh the interpretation, Pharaoh saw that the Spirit of God was in Joseph and that there was none who was as wise and as discerning as Joseph. And Pharaoh placed Joseph in charge of the whole of Egypt (Gen 41:38–41). 

Today, stop looking to yourself for the answer. Ask the Lord for wisdom. The Bible tells us in James 1:5 that if any man lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach. Beloved, Jesus is the source of your wisdom and the answer to every difficult situation you face.

Do you know that God loves to use weak, insignificant things and people? I remember how I was a stutterer in high school. I had serious trouble getting words out of my mouth. But after I surrendered my weakness to the Lord, something supernatural happened. I stopped being conscious of my stuttering and it supernaturally disappeared. 

In my area of weakness, God supplied His perfect strength. Now, seeing how God is using my mouth—what used to be my main weakness—to bring life transformation and miracles, I feel humbled because I know what I was like before God touched me.

Beloved, when you look at yourself today and see your weaknesses, don’t get discouraged! Know that as you depend on God’s grace, He can and will supernaturally transform these weaknesses into strengths. When people look at you and see the transformation in your life, they will know that it is indeed the Lord and He gets all the glory!

In our lives today, there are many legitimate things for us to be concerned about. But there is one thing that Jesus wants us to attend to. And that is to sit at His feet and receive from Him.

Like Martha who was only concerned about doing and serving, when we fail to do that one thing needful, we’ll end up bitter and troubled about many things. On the other hand, when you, like Mary, do that one thing that is needful, you’ll end up restful and filled with the fullness of Jesus.

But she trusted God for favor when she went looking for a field to glean in. She said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field, and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I may find favor” (Ruth 2:2).

Noticed what Ruth was conscious of? Favor! She wasn’t conscious of her natural circumstances that were against her. And because of that, her situation was turned around completely. 

The Bible tells us that she happened to come to the part of the field that belonged to Boaz. And to cut the long story short, Boaz saw Ruth, fell in love with her and married her.

Beloved, when you approach your situation today, be conscious of the Lord’s favor that is all over you! His favor will cause you to be at the right place at the right time, and say the right things at the right time, turning the negative situations in your life around and giving you good success!

One lady told me how she kept confessing her righteousness in Christ, even as she reached for her cigarettes when the compulsion hit her.

102470493134142_446160788765109,"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear… —1 John 4:18

Beloved, you cannot psych or reason fear out of your life. You can’t suppress it and hope that it goes away. Fear has to be cast out, and the only way fear can be cast out is by exposing it to something more powerful—and there is nothing more powerful than the perfect love of God for you. The Father so loved you, that He willingly gave up His only beloved Son to die for you (John 3:16). In the same way God willingly delivered up Jesus for you, He is right now, more than willing to heal you, protect you, provide for you and give you good success in every area of your life. Today, because you are God’s beloved, nothing can ever separate you from His presence, His favor, His love and His help. Receive His perfect love today and begin to live life fear-free!

The Bible says that “the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows” (Luke 12:7). Now, if God cares enough to keep track of the hairs on your head, is there anything too small that you cannot talk to Him about? None! God’s love for you is infinitely detailed. He is vitally and intensely involved in your day-to-day minutiae. Beloved, your heavenly Father wants you to involve Him even in the smallest, most mundane matters of your life. So cast every care to Him, knowing that you have His fullest attention and all of heaven’s resources backing you up!

The whole place was smoky and your hair and clothes soon began to smell of smoke. And even after you had left the restaurant, you still smelled of smoke! In the same way, you cannot spend time in the presence of the Lord without His glory, His majesty, His beauty, His power, His love and His peace rubbing off on you. You will begin to “smell” like Jesus, be bold like Him and be filled with peace like Him! No wonder Acts 4:13 records this about Peter and John: “Now when they [the rulers and elders of Israel] saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they realized that they had been with Jesus.” Beloved, practice the presence of the Lord wherever you are. Talk to Him. Spend time with Him.

Through ministering to people over the years, I’ve found that many are sick because of guilt and condemnation. People condemn themselves for their sins and failures, receive condemnation from others and even think that God is condemning them to a life of sickness. But what most do not realize is that condemnation kills! Beloved, the good news of the gospel is that there is ABSOLUTELY no condemnation for us who are in Christ, because Christ has already been condemned in our place at Calvary! So freely receive God’s gift of no condemnation today by meditating on and thanking Him for it. When you reach out and receive God’s gift of no condemnation, you’ll receive your healing and the wholeness you desire, fully paid for by the blood of His Son! Amen!

Jesus’ presence in your life is an absolute free gift from God. If you’ve realized that and know that no amount of good that you do can earn this free gift, then you will also understand that nothing you do can ever cause His presence to leave you. So be settled in your heart once and for all that Jesus will not abandon you even when you fail because Hebrews 13:5 tells us that once you have received Jesus into your heart, He will never leave you nor forsake you. You can always count on Him because He is a faithful, dependable and trustworthy friend. Even when you have failed Him, He is right there with you, ready to pick you up and restore you to wholeness. The Bible talks about a friend who “sticks closer than a brother”. That’s Jesus and you have Him always!

This man, paralyzed for 38 years, lay by the pool without help and without much hope, waiting for an angel to come to stir its waters—it was known that the first one to step into the waters then would be healed of his condition. But because of his paralysis, the man could never be the first one in. So he kept waiting there, hoping for a miracle. Then one day, he encountered a Man higher than angels—Jesus—who met him at the point of his need. Jesus came to the paralyzed man, and this man, who had been suffering for so many years, walked away completely healed. Beloved, today, Jesus wants to meet you at the point of your need. You don’t need special seasons, circumstances or angels to see the manifestation of your healing. You only need the Lord, who is your very present help in times of need (Psalm 46:1)!

102470493134142_443684539012734,"“Rabbi,” His disciples asked Him, “why was this man born blind? Was it because of his own sins or his parents’ sins?” “It was not because of his sins or his parents’ sins,” Jesus answered. “This happened so the power of God could be seen in him.” 
—John 9:2–3, NLT

I love how our Lord Jesus is such a loving and practical God. When there is a problem, He goes straight to the solution! Before Jesus stepped in to heal the man born blind, his disciples were caught up in uncovering whose sin had made the man blind. Jesus, on the other hand, was interested only in using His power to give the poor man sight! The same way Jesus didn’t get sucked into the “blame game” is the same way He doesn’t want you to. So don’t ask what or whose sin caused your sickness. Forget about what you should or shouldn’t have done or why it happened. Be preoccupied instead with your solution—Jesus Christ, who through the cross has removed every sin in your life and who wants to work a miracle in your body!

Jesus didn’t stop there—whoever encountered Him received from Him what they lacked. He healed the broken hearted and gave sight to the blind. The sick who came to Him were all healed.

One of my favorite stories in the Gospels is of Jesus healing a woman bowed over with a spirit of infirmity for 18 years. Imagine never being able to see the sky or rainbows, but only the dust of the earth and the grubby feet of people—what a painful existence she lived! I love how Jesus saw this woman and immediately called her over to receive a miracle from Him. When Jesus said to her, “Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity,” He was proclaiming liberty over her and setting her free from that crippling condition. He laid hands on her and she immediately received her healing. Beloved, you too have already been set free from the curse of sickness by Jesus’ finished work at the cross.

PSALM 91

1 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
2 I will say of the Lord, “ He is my refuge and my fortress;
My God, in Him I will trust.”
3 Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler
And from the perilous pestilence.
4 He shall cover you with His feathers,
And under His wings you shall take refuge;
His truth shall be your shield and buckler.
5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,
Nor of the arrow that flies by day,
6 Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,
Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.
7 A thousand may fall at your side,
And ten thousand at your right hand;
But it shall not come near you.
8 Only with your eyes shall you look,
And see the reward of the wicked.
9 Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge,
Even the Most High, your dwelling place,
10 No evil shall befall you,
Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;
11 For He shall give His angels charge over you,
To keep you in all your ways.
12 In their hands they shall bear you up,
Lest you dash your foot against a stone.
13 You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra,
The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.
14 “Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him;
I will set him on high, because he has known My name.
15 He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;
I will be with him in trouble;
I will deliver him and honor him.

PSALM 91

1 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
2 I will say of the Lord, “ He is my refuge and my fortress;
My God, in Him I will trust.”
3 Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler
And from the perilous pestilence.
4 He shall cover you with His feathers,
And under His wings you shall take refuge;
His truth shall be your shield and buckler.
5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,
Nor of the arrow that flies by day,
6 Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,
Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.
7 A thousand may fall at your side,
And ten thousand at your right hand;
But it shall not come near you.
8 Only with your eyes shall you look,
And see the reward of the wicked.
9 Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge,
Even the Most High, your dwelling place,
10 No evil shall befall you,
Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;
11 For He shall give His angels charge over you,
To keep you in all your ways.
12 In their hands they shall bear you up,
Lest you dash your foot against a stone.
13 You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra,
The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.
14 “Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him;
I will set him on high, because he has known My name.
15 He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;
I will be with him in trouble;
I will deliver him and honor him.
16 With long life I will satisfy him,
And show him My salvation.”"

Many years ago, Wendy and I went to a restaurant for dinner when she was pregnant with Jessica. As we were about to order our food, a man seated not too far away from us took out a pack of cigarettes and prepared to take a smoke. I really didn’t want Wendy to take in any of that secondhand cigarette smoke, but there was no non-smoking section in that restaurant. So guess what I did? I prayed! Under my breath, I told the Lord, “Lord, I know that I am Your beloved. Please stop that man from smoking in this restaurant.” That was all I said—a quick and simple prayer.

Guess what happened? That man tried to light his cigarette, but he just could not get his lighter to work! He persisted and kept trying, but no matter what he did, the lighter simply would not work. After some time, he shoved his cigarettes back in his shirt pocket in frustration. Praise Jesus! 

I want you to know that even in the little things, God hears and answers the prayers of you, His beloved. Nothing is too big or too small for your Daddy God. If it matters to you, it matters to Him. The more you are conscious of the fact that you are His beloved, the more you will walk in His unmerited favor in every situation! Amen!

Notice that at this point, Jesus had neither begun His ministry, nor performed any miracle. Yet, the Father was well-pleased with Him.

Beloved, do you know that today, your Father in heaven loves you the same way? This means that the very same words that the Father spoke over Jesus are the same words that He is speaking over you right now. His love for you is not dependent on your qualifications, your looks or your achievements. His love for you is unconditional. He delights in you before you have even done a single thing right! So take some time to meditate on this thought today: “I am my Father’s beloved and He is well-pleased with me!” Know that as you go about your daily activities, He is smiling at you with delight in His eyes!

But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty. —1 Corinthians 1:26–27

Beloved do you know that God loves to choose the weak to confound the mighty? You see, I was a stutterer in high school.  I had serious trouble getting words out of my mouth.  But after I surrendered my weakness to the Lord, something supernatural happened. I stopped being conscious of my stuttering and it supernaturally disappeared.  In my area of weakness, God supplied His perfect strength.  And now, seeing how God is using my mouth—my main weakness—to bring life transformation and miracles, I feel humbled because I know what I was like before God touched me.

It is to sit at His feet and receive from Him.

On the other hand, when you, like Mary, do that one thing that is needful, you’ll end up restful, and filled with the fullness of Jesus.

Joseph in the Bible knew that God was the source of his wisdom. When Pharaoh said, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream, to interpret it,” Joseph immediately replied, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace” (Genesis 41:15–16). Have you noticed that Joseph was not looking to himself to provide an answer? He was looking to the wisdom of God. When Joseph gave Pharaoh the interpretation, Pharaoh saw that the Spirit of God was in Joseph and that there was none who was as wise and as discerning as Joseph. And Pharaoh placed Joseph in charge of the whole of Egypt (Genesis 41:38–41). 

So today in your situation, stop looking to yourself for the answer but ask the Lord for wisdom. The Bible tells us in James 1:5 that if any man lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach. Beloved, Jesus is the source of your wisdom and the answer to every situation you face. Amen!

102470493134142_424271877620667,"Therefore do not worry, saying, “What shall we eat?” or “What shall we drink?” or “What shall we wear?”…For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. (Matthew 6:31–33)

Now, Jesus was not saying that these things—food, drink and clothing—are not important. In fact, He says that “your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.” But what Jesus wants us to do is to “seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,” and He promises that “all these things shall be added to you.” Now, who is God’s righteousness? Jesus Christ. And who is the king of the “kingdom of God” that we are to seek? Jesus Christ (Revelation 19:16)! Jesus was actually referring to Himself.

102470493134142_422921394422382,"When the Pharisees brought the woman caught in adultery to Jesus, they came to Him quoting from the law, saying, “Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?” (John 8:4–5). They thought that they had succeeded in trapping Jesus because if He told them to stone her, then they would accuse Him of not demonstrating the forgiveness and grace that He had been preaching about. If He were to say that they should not stone her, then they would accuse Him of breaking the law of Moses and bring a charge against Him. Now, observe the wisdom of Jesus in operation. He simply told them, “He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first” (John 8:7). With one statement, he upheld the perfect standard of the law, silenced the accusers, and loved the sinner. Without flinching, He simply challenged the person who was perfect before the law to cast the first stone. Pricked by their conscience, the Pharisees who had come to ensnare Jesus began to walk away one by one, completely silenced. 

Beloved, 1 Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Jesus “became for us wisdom from God”, and because you are in Him, the same wisdom that Jesus has is available to you! Begin to see yourself in Christ, who is always flowing with divine wisdom, always in control, and the same wisdom that flows in Him will flow in and through you. Depend on Jesus’ wisdom to succeed and you will see whatever you do prosper. Amen!

But what we need is not more “self-help.” What we need is the Lord’s help! Beloved, I’m for the pursuit of knowledge. However, natural wisdom can only yield natural results. When you look to God for His divine wisdom, you’ll surely see supernatural results! Is there an area in your life today where you haven’t seen breakthrough? Ask God for wisdom!

102470493134142_422244244490097,"Ruth in the Old Testament was possibly at the lowest point of her life just before she met Boaz. All the natural factors were against her. She was a poor widow, and she was a Moabitess, a Gentile in the Jewish nation of Israel. But she trusted God for favor when she went looking for a field to glean in. She said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field, and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I may find favor”. (Ruth 2:2) Then, the Bible tells us that she happened to come to the part of the field that belonged to Boaz. And to cut the long story short, Boaz saw Ruth, fell in love with her and married her. 

Noticed what Ruth was conscious of? Favor! She wasn’t conscious of her natural circumstances that were against her. And because of that, her situation was turned around completely. Beloved, when you approach your situation today, be conscious of the Lord’s favor that is all over you!

In Genesis 24, we read the account of Abraham sending his unnamed servant to look for a bride for his son, Isaac. This servant arrived at a well outside the city of Nahor in the evening and decided to stop there. There were so many young women gathered to draw water there that he did not know who would be the right woman for Isaac. So the unnamed servant prayed this prayer: “O Lord God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.” 

Now, the word “success” here is the Hebrew word qarah, which means “to encounter, to meet (without prearrangement), to chance to be present.” In a nutshell, it means “right happening.” The servant essentially prayed, “Give me qarah this day.” With the Lord’s qarah or positioning for right happenings, the servant found a beautiful and virtuous woman named Rebekah, who became Isaac’s bride.

Beloved, what is it that you need today? You can pray for qarah. In whatever assignments, appointments or errands you have to attend to today, ask the Lord to show you kindness and give you qarah—success. And like Abraham’s servant, you shall experience divine success in all that you do! Amen!

Beloved, God wants you to know that He is your God of divine happenings. He will place you at the right place at the right time, where you will meet the right people and do the right things! This means that if you are looking for a job, He can cause you to meet someone who will open doors of opportunities for you.

Years ago, while I was on vacation with Wendy in the breathtaking Canadian Rockies, 
we spent time soaking in the splendor of our heavenly Father’s creation. As we wandered along the bank of a river, we stumbled upon a majestic tree anchored by the water’s edge. Its trunk was sturdy and strong, and its branches stretched out to form a perfect canopy above it. The tree was constantly nourished by the river and in contrast to the other trees that were further away from the river, its leaves were refreshingly green and luscious. Looking at that tree, I couldn’t help but recall the blessed man described in Jeremiah 17, and I remember saying to myself then, “I am like this tree in Jesus’ name!” 

Beloved, when you depend on and place your trust in Jesus instead of yourself, your qualifications, your looks or even your circumstances, you will be like this beautiful and majestic tree!

102470493134142_420628071318381,"Beloved, there are essentially two ways to live life. The first way is to depend on and trust entirely in the Lord’s unmerited favor, while the other way is to depend on your self-efforts to strive for success. You see, if you depend on your self-efforts, you will most likely end up stressed, with no quality time for your family, and even experience poor health. But God’s ways are higher. When you depend on Him, He will cause you to not only accomplish much, but be relaxed, have time to spend with your family, and experience divine health. 

So beloved, I want to encourage you to choose God’s way. In all that you do, place your trust not in your good works, your efforts and your abilities, but in His unearned and undeserved favor that is upon you, and watch Him bring you to a place of good success that no amount of self-effort can ever bring!

Let me ask you which came first? Peter’s repentance, or the goodness of the Lord? I submit to you that true repentance comes when we see the goodness of the Lord. In Peter’s case, though he was not perfect and didn’t have his act altogether, Jesus still chose to use him and to bless him. It was the goodness of the Lord that led him to repentance!

Years ago, I was the president of my youth ministry and I used to preach to my youths, “You’ve got to love God! You’ve got to love the Lord with all your heart, all your mind and all your soul!” Yet I was wondering to myself, “How in the world do I do that?” Then, I didn’t know that I was actually placing my youths under the law, because the sum total of the law is to love God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind and all your strength. (Matthew 22:37-40) You see, my friend, no one has been able to love the Lord with all his heart, soul and mind. But our Lord and Savior Jesus went to the cross to die for us. With arms out-stretched, He declared that He would love us with all His heart, all His mind, and all His soul. Under law, it is all about our love for Him.

102470493134142_417934738254381,"Many years ago when I was seventeen, I was drafted into national service like all the other teenage boys in my country. One day, as part of my training in the navy I was on a boat travelling on choppy waters. Less than half an hour into the journey, you could see all the rookies looking unwell and feeling nauseous. Eventually, an officer came on board and told us, ""Hey, don't look at the choppy waters around you. Look far away where the horizon is and you will feel better."" We heeded his advice and began looking at the horizon. As we did that, we became less nauseous and felt better. 

Like the horizon, God's love for you is fixed and constant. On the other hand, our love for God is like the waves, which varies and is unpredictable. On some days it is on a high while on other days it is at a low. Beloved, if your security depends on your love for God, it’ll be shaky and unstable. But if it is based on God’s unfailing love for you, you’ll become unshakable. Focus on God’s love for you today! Keep looking to His love that is unchangeable no matter what is happening in your life!

Do we depend on our own effort to change? Or do we depend on God’s grace in our lives? God is not interested in behavior modification!

When you catch a revelation of just how much God loves you, effortless transformation will come without you struggling, and you will see that bad habit fall off! Amen!

Beloved, how did you receive the gift of salvation? Was it by your own efforts, or was it by His grace? Did you have to work for your forgiveness or did you simply receive it because of Jesus’ work on the cross? If the greatest gift of our salvation came completely free by His grace, how much more every other good thing in life? Today, don’t look at your performance to decide if you are deserving of Jesus’ blessings and favor in your life. It is not about you or your works. It’s all about Jesus and His work.

102470493134142_416895525024969,"I love the story in the Bible about the woman caught in adultery, because I love the way our loving Savior, Jesus, responded to her. He looked tenderly into her eyes and asked her, “Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?” She looked around and said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.” (John 8:10–11). 
Notice that Jesus first gave the woman the gift of no condemnation and then told her to go and sin no more. Beloved, the power to stop the cycle of sin in your life comes from receiving the gift of no condemnation from Jesus. This is grace, my friend. This is His unmerited favor! The law says, “Go and sin no more first, then God will not condemn you.” Grace says, “I have already taken all your condemnation on the cross. Now, you can go and sin no more.”

Have you ever read Isaiah 53 about the sufferings of Jesus? It says, ""it pleased the Lord to bruise Him."" And the word `bruise' there in Hebrew is to ‘crush’. When I first read it, I couldn't understand that! I told the Lord: I know You gave us Your Son, but how can You say that it pleased You to crush Him? I got my answer a few days later, when I brought my wife and my daughter to the mall. At the end of the shopping trip, my wife and I had our hands filled with shopping bags and Jessica was tired. So I picked her up and she immediately fell asleep. While carrying my daughter on one arm and trying to balance the rest of the bags in the other, I realised that it was quite a distance to the parking lot and my arm was beginning to go numb! Yet I couldn’t bear to put her down and wake her up because I love her too much. As my hand went to sleep, the next stage came—pins and needles! 
Beloved, right there and then, I realized what God meant when He said that it pleased Him to crush His Son. Just like how I would rather ‘crush’ my arm than wake my daughter because I love her, God allowed His Son, Jesus, to be crushed because He so loved us!

Not a single one of them died though they murmured. And that is a picture of pure grace.” When I heard that, I turned to the Bible feverishly to check—as if to prove to God that somebody died! Because until then, I had never heard anyone preaching about this! And indeed, I could not find anyone who died before the law was given at Mount Sinai. You see, God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt and provided for them, not based on their goodness, but based entirely on His goodness. Because we are under the new covenant of grace, God’s blessing and provision for us are based not on our performance, but entirely on HIS goodness! Hallelujah!

Beloved, when God gave the Ten Commandments on Mt Sinai, He gave it through a messenger, but when the new covenant of grace came, it came embodied in the person of His beloved Son, Jesus! When something is given, it can be sent from afar, but when someone comes, it is the picture of a relationship and of drawing near! For instance, a friend can send you a gift by post, but if he purposefully makes a trip down just to pass it to you in person, it says something about how much you mean to him and how important that gift is! My friend, the greatest gift was delivered to us when Jesus Himself came to reveal the fullness of God's grace! On the cross, He bore all our iniquities, pains and sorrows and died for us, so that today we might have an abundance of grace in our lives—completely undeserved and unmerited—simply because He loves us dearly.

What is your response the moment something bad happens to you? Do you immediately think that God is punishing you for something wrong that you did? Do you start worrying that it was because you flared up while on the road, or that you lost your temper with your kids, or perhaps, you did something you knew you shouldn’t have done?
Beloved, if we believe that God is out to punish us, that would only bring us down the road of fear and torment! We would have no confidence and would be living in constant fear of some bad occurrence each time we fail. So what should we do? Let us take a look at what the Bible says—there is no fear in love! Because of Jesus’ great love for us, He went to the cross and exhausted ALL of God’s punishment for our sins and failures. Today, you will never have to fear that God is angry with you!

102470493134142_415030055211516,"Some years ago, I noticed that one of my church members suddenly stopped coming to church for a long time. I met up with him to find out how he was doing and to see if everything was alright. He told me that he was going through a lot of problems in his marriage, and that he was now addicted to alcohol. Then, he said this: “Let me get my life right, then I will come back to church.” That was when I smiled and asked him, “Do you clean yourself before you take a bath?” I could tell from his expression that he was taken aback by my question, so I told him, “Come as you are to the Lord. He is the bath. He will cleanse you. He will get your life in order for you, and He will cause every addiction to lose its hold on you.” And true enough, as this precious brother kept coming back, his life was soon transformed—his marriage was restored and he was no longer addicted to alcohol. Beloved, are the failures and mistakes in your life keeping you from coming to Him today? Jesus is your “bath”! Come to Him with all your imperfections and faults. God loves you just the way you are, but He also loves you too much to let you stay the same. Just like this brother, as you behold Jesus, conscious of His unconditional love and acceptance of you, His grace will go to work in your life transforming you into that same image of glory. Amen!

I have received many testimonies from people who were able to quit their addictions effortlessly as they leaned on Jesus’ favor and confessed their righteousness in Christ. One lady told me how she kept confessing her righteousness in Christ, even as she reached for her cigarettes when the compulsion hit her. A short while later she noticed that she seemed to have “forgotten to smoke”. Since then, she has been completely delivered from her smoking addiction. Beloved, whatever addiction you are facing today, believe and declare that even right there in the midst of your struggle, you are still righteous. The more you receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness, the more you will reign over every addiction.

I’m reminded today of what Jesus said of the woman in Luke 7 who brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil and anointed Jesus’ feet. In truth, none of us have been forgiven little, all of us have been forgiven much. The difference was that this woman knew it, and thus she loved Jesus much.

Contrary to popular belief, this saying that “God helps those who help themselves” is not in the Bible! God does not help those who help themselves. He helps those who are helpless and dependent on Him. He helps those who look to Him as their only source of help for their problem.

As you are trusting the Lord for healing today, it is so important for you to know that God wants you healed and well. My Bible tells me clearly that God is a God of love and that He is a good God (1 Chronicles 16:34; 1 John 4:16). 

This means that if you are sick, God’s heart is and will always be to heal and restore health and life to you. He so desires for you to walk in health and life that He gave you His beloved Son, Jesus, so that you might have life and have it more abundantly (John 10:10). God is for you to walk in abundant health and life. He does not want your body and life sapped, incapacitated or debilitated by pain, sickness and disease, and He will never withhold healing from you. 

How important is your healing and health to the Lord? So important that He Himself paid the heaviest and most terrible price for your wholeness! At the cross, Jesus was judged, burnt, smitten and crushed. He paid the full price for your healing, health and wholeness so you could experience His abundant life. Today, there is no symptom in your body that is too insignificant for Him to care about, and no condition that is greater than what His finished work has accomplished.

Too many Christians believe the enemy's lies that self-condemnation, or sin-consciousness are virtues for healthy Christian living. However, God's Word declares that because we are in Christ today, God does NOT condemn us.
It is important to remove the destructive condemnation from your life so that you can break the cycle of defeat and live the abundant life God has planned for you.
I believe that right believing leads to right living. You cannot set yourself free from condemnation by self-efforts. But when you believe the finished work of Jesus has made you righteous in God's eyes, you receive His power to reign over your negative circumstances and live the abundant life.
Condemnation kills, but the Spirit gives life! Always look to the finished work of Jesus who paid the price for your freedom. Look and live!"

I believe that God wants to overwhelm you with His unmerited favor and bless you in every area of life!
One of the keys to receiving God's blessings is a very simple one: Live life being a blessing to the people around us. 
There's a powerful story in 2 Kings 4:1-7 about a widow who could not pay her debts. She asked the prophet Elisha what to do, and when he asked her what she had in her house, all she had was a single jar of oil. Elisha told her to pour out the oil into as many containers as she could find. As she did so, God supernaturally replenished the oil in the jar until she ran out of containers to pour into! Notice that as long as she kept pouring out, GOD KEPT PROVIDING.
Beloved, God wants to work the same miracle in your life. The key to receiving God's blessing is this: Pour out! A life lived only for yourself can be a miserable one. If you keep holding on to what is in your hand and not letting go of it, it will eventually grow stale & lifeless. However, when you take whatever you have and pour it out at the instruction of God, His supernatural supply will continue to flow into your life.

God wants to bring you out of your wilderness of lack, worry, doubt, striving and discouragement and into His life-giving blessing of rest!
When God brought the children of Israel out of Egyptian bondage, He told them He had prepared a place for them—a land of abundance, provision and more than enough. As slaves in Egypt, God’s people were forced to work long, hard hours. They had no rest and no relief before they stepped into their land of promise.
Just as God prepared a promised land for His people, He has prepared one for us. But like so many of the Israelites of that first generation who did not enter the promised land, many believers are wandering around, unable to enter in and receive the promise.
In the new covenant, our promised land today is not a physical location but a place of rest in Christ through His finished work at the cross. We inherit all the promises of provision, protection, peace and divine favor because of what He has already done for us.
Jesus’ finished work on the cross opens doors, heals hearts and lives, and provides every spiritual and physical blessing you will ever need. If you’re tired, worn out and burned out today, Jesus is the way to real rest, refreshment and rejuvenation."

102470493134142_342047675821499,"Walk In Godly Counsel & Wisdom
 
Today's Bible Verse:

""Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the path of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful."" Psalm 1:1

Dear friends,

We are blessed when we walk not in the counsel of the ungodly. In other words, don't trust your life with counsel that is ungodly but rather, place your trust in sound godly counsel that is founded and established on the eternal everlasting Word of God.

Have you noticed that ""ungodly counsel"" is never constant? At one time, ""experts"" would say ""eat this supplement, it is good for your health."" The next moment, another group of ""experts"" would refute this and claim that ""eating this supplement will cause all kinds of health complications."" You see, the world's wisdom and counsel is never constant. When it comes to what to eat and what not to eat, learn to be lead practically by the Holy Spirit's counsel within you. Tune in and listen - He will lead you to cut down on a certain types of food, and increase your intake of other kinds; He will let you know when you are not drinking enough water or that you have been eating a particular food excessively.

""Really? Does God do that?""

Absolutely! Our heavenly Father is interested in every facet of your life. He made you and you are precious in His eyes. The more you meditate on His Word in 2012, the more you will experience and effectively hear His divine counsel and leading. My friend, His Word in your life is an eternal guarantee. It never fails and it never fades away. It stands the test of time while ""ungodly counsel"" is tossed about through every changing wind.

Today, make a decisive call to walk not in the counsel of the ungodly. Trust and depend fully upon the counsel of the Lord by feeding on His word daily. Say ""Lord Jesus, today my trust is in you and in you alone. I will not put my trust in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful (the complainers). Thank you Jesus - you are my source for every counsel, wisdom and advice I need for my life today.""

...
Dear friends, there is a precious promise in the bible that you simply cannot ignore! I want to challenge you to meditate on God's word like never before in 2012.

God promises that if this Book - the Bible - does not depart from your mouth, but you meditate in it both day & night - you will not only experience His abundant blessings and provisions this year, but more importantly, good success in your marriage, your family, your career & your ministry! If you desire to experience Jesus' unceasing fruitfulness in 2012, get radical in meditating on His word this year!

Open your bible and choose a daily verse in the morning like Psalms 23:1 - ""The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want"". Start chewing on it and muttering it under your breath throughout the day. And before you go to sleep at night, bring out that verse again and meditate on it as you lie on your bed. Day & night, day & night, let His Word nourish you, strengthen you, and impart wisdom & favor to you. I promise you that 2012 will, without a doubt, be your best year yet!

No Dialysis Needed For Mom, Teaching On Unmerited Favor
Carrie Kolb | Mexico

A couple of weeks ago, I asked for prayer from your ministry for my mom. She was in the last stage of kidney failure and the doctor said that she would have to go on dialysis. I want to thank you for praying.

She went back to the doctor and she has improved in all areas. Her potassium level was normal and the first time in a long time, her blood pressure was normal too. She is 73 years old and she said that receiving Joseph Prince’s Daily Devotionals has changed her life.

I also read to her the healing devotionals from the Destined To Reign Devotional book from my home in Guadalajara, to her back in the States. Thank you for your ministry!

On another note of praise, my husband and I are missionaries here in Mexico. And I have just recently begun to teach the women in the women ministry. Each week, I would take a chapter from Unmerited Favor and share with each woman who has their own book in Spanish. We are very grateful to God for your ministry."

Seeing God’s Favor In A Fresh And Powerful Way

I want to thank you for writing 100 Days Of Favor and Unmerited Favor. I watch you on my local channel, @Trinity Broadcasting Network, here in Virginia, and what a blessing your ministry has been to me and my office.

I ordered 100 Days Of Favor and place it on the bookrack here at the Chaplain’s Office where I work. The feedback from this book and the testimonies that I have received from different people, after they have used it as a daily devotion, is so powerful and rewarding to know. 

My life and the lives of those who have picked this book out of the rack and applied the truths taught have been impacted. I have never had favor explained to me the way you did in 100 Days Of Favor. I am so excited to know that I don’t live under the law but under His gift of amazing grace, and I receive this gift. I have read this book for the second time and plan on reading it again and again. 

Thank you for all that you do to bring the uncompromising Word of God to people all over the world. Glory to His holy name!

While waiting for their healing,some people find it hard to believe that Jesus really took their sicknesses,just as He took their sin.If that is you,don't feel condemned. Your Father in heaven understands.That is why He put the word ""SURELY"" there when He said,""SURELY, My Son has borne your sickness & carried your pains."" Isaiah 53:4.Rest in His SURE promises.Amen!

I believe that the more righteousness-conscious you are,the more of God's unmerited favor you will experience.When the voice of disqualification comes to remind you of all the areas that you have fallen short in, that's the time to turn to Jesus & hear His voice, which qualifies you.

The Bible tell us that God's anger lasts only for a moment,but His mercy endures forever. His anger ended the moment it was exhausted on Jesus at the cross.
