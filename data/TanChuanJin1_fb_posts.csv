We prefer to keep marriages strong and intact, and have put in place programmes to help in that area. But try as we might, marriages will break down and when it does, we want to ensure that the children are not hurt in the process. The counsellors and case workers at CCP are committed to helping the children cope but unfortunately, they have been at the receiving end of negative and angry outbursts from some parents over child access issues.   Like the rest of the four MSF appointed Divorce Support Specialist Agencies, they really do understand and empathise with their clients‚Äô pain and grief, as they strive to be the voice for the children caught in between their parents‚Äô acrimony.
 
I thank the teams at the CCP and Divorce Support Specialist Agencies for their hard work and dedication, and for being the pillar of support to these families as they journey through difficult life events such as divorce."

They are inspiring examples of individuals who have overcome adversities to pursue their passion. More importantly, they remind all of us that we can do our part to look beyond the disabilities of our friends and colleagues, cheer them on and encourage them to pursue and realise their dreams.

Beyond the trends of an ageing society, smaller families, divorced and single-parent households, there are emerging trends which will continue to change the face of our society. PPIS has been making good headways through its PPIS Family Therapy Institute. The inaugural conference yesterday morning brings together like-minded practitioners in sharing their knowledge and experiences in working with families in need. This is crucial in building the capabilities of social work sector to address the rise in more complex familial issues.

Seeing them happy at work and enjoying what they do, reinforces the fact that persons with disabilities can and do contribute valuably to our workforce, as long as employers are committed to providing them with the right job fit and work environment.
 
First stop was Shangri-La‚Äôs Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa, where Wanyi works.  Ever cheerful and bubbly, Wanyi, who has Down Syndrome, has been working in the hotel‚Äôs housekeeping team for over four years now, and enjoys her work greatly. She meticulously walked me through what she does daily as a uniform attendant, locating and handing out clean uniforms to colleagues ‚Äì it takes good memory and fast fingers to be able to do her job well! üòÑ Other than Wanyi, Shangri-La‚Äôs Rasa Sentosa hires 14 other persons with disabilities.  There is a real interest and commitment from the management team in hiring persons with disabilities, and the workplace culture also provides the necessary support for them to do well in their jobs.  I do hope to see more employers taking this step ‚Äì there are in fact resources and grants for them to tap on to make workplaces conducive for persons with disabilities.  For instance, SGEnable‚Äôs Open Door Programme provides employers with up to 90% of the job re-design costs to recruit and retain persons with disabilities. There is also the Special Employment Credit when you hire people with disabilities. 
 
Popped by NCSS Singapore after lunch, where my colleague Peng Kai works as a researcher.  Peng Kai, who has cerebral palsy, often joins his colleagues for makan at Ghim Moh market opposite his workplace. I hear he‚Äôs well-loved by his colleagues and joins them social outings after work üòÑ Peng Kai‚Äôs colleague, Jarn May, is in finance and the resident coach for sign-language classes in NCSS. Though Jarn May is deaf, she has no issues performing her task using assistive technology at work. Her colleagues communicate with her via the messaging system and emails.  Being a key driver and employer in the social sector, NCSS aims to be the champion of inclusive employment for vulnerable groups.  There are currently 7 staff at NCSS who are persons with disabilities and persons with mental health issues.
 
Let us continue to see persons with disabilities for who they are, not the disability they have.

~ Genesis 17:1

Learning something new everywhere I go. I have never been to Caldwell House. These are the convent quarters on both sides of the CHIJMES chapel. We were there in a room which is presently used for registration of marriage, small receptions etc. I saw these words on the wall. I guess they must have been there originally. I google translated it, and learnt what it meant. It sounded really familiar but I couldn't quite recall where it was from. Checked again. Ah. Came from the Bible when God called Abraham: ""When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, ‚ÄúI am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless,""

Pure coincodence I am sure. But the theme for the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped was ""Walk Unafraid""! What a beautiful fearless slogan. If we can as a society be embracing and inclusive, we can really help our fellow visually impaired Singaporeans walk unafraid.

 ~ Xinyan

24-year-old Xinyan is a young kidney dialysis patient who was stricken with cancer ‚Äì several times. Yet she remains active and cheerful. Despite having to temporarily stop school for treatment, Xinyan doesn‚Äôt back down in the face of difficulty. After completing her studies at Hwa Chong, Xinyan pursued graphic design at Lasalle. Today, she‚Äôs even working part time as a graphic designer.

Xinyan‚Äôs tenacity and strength is truly an inspiration. It‚Äôs an honour to be able to present her with the Smile & Encouragement Award at NKF‚Äôs Life Champion Award Ceremony yesterday morning.

At the event, I also launched NKF‚Äôs Patient Education Programme. Like Xinyan, these resilient individuals have overcome many difficulties in their lives. And standing with them are their families, friends and caregivers who never doubted their abilities to stay strong and cheerful despite their illnesses.

They make every effort to lead healthy lifestyles. They attend exercises classes specially tailored for them to improve their physical condition, adhere to a dietary guideline that is suggested by dieticians, and they form meaningful friendships that provide them with strong emotional and psychological support. I hope these patients will continue to make a difference in the lives of others in their own ways, and inspire more of us with their stories.

Do continue to support NKF!

Introduction

I am honoured to join you this morning, at the inaugural International Family Law Conference. I am glad to see this opportunity where so many of us can share our thoughts and experiences on issues we are passionate about. We must endeavour to learn from each other.

Importantly, in this same room, we have family practitioners as well as policy-makers. Many of us have different roles. Some work in the court room, some are in the community with clients, some are working the processes in an office. But there is an important constant - we are all partners who care for families in crisis.

We share the same heartache of seeing families enter our family justice and welfare system. When there is acrimony in divorce and battles in Court, our children become embroiled in the embittered tussle. And there are consequences for our children in the long haul. When there is abuse in the family, our children bear the physical and emotional scars.

As agents in the family law and social welfare fields, we share these experiences. We all know the life-stories that tell of anger, vengeful disputes between spouses, violence against family members, and the subsequent long-term damage left on a child.

Keeping families-in-crisis together

Against this backdrop, let me state categorically that we as a society have a duty to support these families. Every community has families who experience moments of crisis. Whether the crisis is the threat of family break-up, or the destructive spiral of perpetual violence, the social and justice systems must have a ready response.

In Singapore, we want a supportive system that is thoughtful, compassionate and hopeful in preserving families.

The family is the building block of a strong, safe and stable society. Each family unit must function as a safe environment of care and protection for our children, as well as, vulnerable family members.

I will elaborate, in three parts, how we intend to keep families together.

Upstream and preventive efforts to break cycles

First, I want to keep families intact by going upstream and this will involve ramping up preventive efforts. I want to break the cycles.

Let me share Jane‚Äôs story of her encounter with violence. You may read about this in MSF‚Äôs recent publication ‚ÄúProtecting Children in Singapore‚Äù.

Jane‚Äôs nightmare of being sexually abused by her stepfather began when she was eight. At fourteen, her teacher found her crying in school. Tearfully, Jane disclosed how she had been violated over six years whilst growing up. What followed was an intensive, conscientious response in investigative and protection work. We supported her and helped her recover. We made every effort to work with Jane and her care-givers to repair this young lady‚Äôs sense of safety, and security.

Even with the comprehensive support of the social system, victims of abuse often continue to experience long-lasting and complex trauma. This sometimes manifests in challenging behaviours that may cause distress to those around a young person dealing with trauma.

You might meet young people like Jane, and their families in a variety of contexts. As a judge, you may be required to decide on the child‚Äôs placement, while weighing the crisis that the family is undergoing. What would a thoughtful and compassionate decision be? Would the child be able to recover in a family who, at present, is working through how it can provide a safe environment? Or would a children‚Äôs home be more appropriate for the time being, to ensure the child‚Äôs immediate safety? But when then is it okay for the child to be reunited and be raised by his or her natural parents?

Now as a social worker, you may encounter such a child. You will have sessions where you‚Äôre partnering the family to work through the safety considerations and practical arrangements necessary, given the child‚Äôs fragile state. Would the agreed-upon plan work when the family‚Äôs relational issues are still work-in-progress? These are practical questions grappled by many of you daily. It is frightfully difficult. It is very easy for people to comment on social media. But it is very difficult, and emotionally very challenging for many of you.

For the benefit of our friends from abroad, Singapore‚Äôs child protection system comprises a network of agencies. This includes my Ministry‚Äôs child protection officers, the Police, the judiciary, hospitals, schools, and voluntary welfare organisations. These are my Ministry‚Äôs close partners. They are key partners because they all encounter children in their day-to-day work. And the key word is partnership. We need to do this together.

In 2015, we introduced a national framework for child protection. The screening and reporting guide for our partners to better detect and manage child abuses was part of it. Tailoring the guide for healthcare, social service and education sectors was an effort highlighting our commitment to outcomes, and willingness to work better as a system.

Frontline professionals who have regular contact with children use these customised guides. It allows them to relate, and respond to the specific situations in which they find themselves.

These include deciding whether to be rightly concerned about a particular child they encounter. Whether to take further action ‚Äì such as surfacing the suspected abuse within their organisation. In some cases, they may need to make referrals to the right agency to follow-up to protect the child. The development of these customised guides was significant for Singapore; lauded, in fact, as a first-of-its-kind effort among any child welfare system in the world. I am glad that MSF has allies in these partnering agencies. I value their dedication in working with us to adapt international best-practices for our specific, local use.

Together, our efforts have uncovered more suspected child abuse cases. Now these cases could have gone undetected in the past. Currently, MSF‚Äôs Child Protective Service is investigating more cases of serious harm done to children. The average number of such investigations used to range from 40 to 50 a month. Today, the numbers have doubled. And we really cannot do this work alone. We need families, professionals, volunteers and you to make collective efforts to keep children safe.

It is equally important for us to remember that behind each statistic, is a precious life and a family. We need to have as few children as possible, if not none, who live in fear every day. As we work with families at risk of breaking down, we must adopt family-based strategies that are child-centric in approach.

Let me now share an example of what my Ministry will do to keep families intact as far as possible. MSF will be starting the Safe and Strong Families (SSF) pilot programme by December 2016. The SSF consists two types of services: family preservation and family reunification services. The Family Preservation Service involves intensive in-home services to support and keep families together and prevents unnecessary removal of the child from the family. The Family Reunification Service seeks to reunify children who are in alternative care, such as foster or residential care ‚Äì so that they can be reunited effectively with their families in a safe and timely manner.

After hearing Jane‚Äôs story, some of us may be sceptical about whether all families can be safe and nurturing for their children. And I will confess that when I first came to this Ministry ‚Äì and as a Member of Parliament who has personally seen some of these issues on the ground ‚Äì I had also wondered if we should be prepared and more ready to take children away sometimes, from the contexts in which some of the children find themselves in.

But there is growing research that shows that children need to be protected by their caregivers, and know that they can depend on them. Such children will grow to have higher self-esteem as well as better self-reliance. They also tend to be more independent; have lower reported instances of anxiety and depression, and are able to form better social relationships.

Having the natural family empowered and supported to capably meet the children‚Äôs needs would be ideal for families in Singapore. Having said that, when the natural family is not able to do this, and when we feel that it is in the best interest of the child, we must also be prepared to take the child away; and when it is suitable, to reunite them to their family.

In MSF, we try very hard to ensure that children who have been temporarily separated from their natural families are placed in a familial environment when they are in our care. We also endeavour to ensure that the children are safely reunited with their natural families. Hence, for the SSF pilot, a crucial element is an evidence-based intervention programme known as Functional Family Therapy. Trained professionals visit the place of residence and conduct intensive weekly sessions in the child‚Äôs family environment for four to six months. They aim to help the family address a range of issues such as violence, substance abuse and conduct disorders.

Such an intensive therapy is particularly suited for families where there are more complex relationship problems, and specialised psychological support for families is needed. So it is never just about the child, it is about the context, the broader family unit as well.

The advantage of this intervention is that it is delivered in the child‚Äôs natural home environment, which ensures the child‚Äôs natural caregivers are also actively involved. This increases the chance of treatment success. We are hopeful that these families would, ultimately, be able to support their child, and the child will grow up to be a healthy young person and adult.

Timely and child-centric family services

Moving on to the second strategy for preserving families in Singapore. Now this involves reaching families-in-crisis with timely services, delivered in a child-centric manner.

Many of us know that family forms in Singapore are changing. This has many implications on how we serve families in need of support.

A significant proportion of marriages involving Singaporeans are transnational in nature ‚Äì close to 40%. Most of these couples they will form stable and strong families, but some non-resident spouses face difficulties managing cross-cultural differences as they settle down in Singapore.

So in 2014, we rolled out programmes ‚Äì including the Marriage Preparation Programme and Marriage Support Programme ‚Äì for Singaporean-foreigner couples. We need to better understand this group, as we review our policies and programmes to better support them.

Unfortunately, divorces are also on the rise in Singapore. When a marriage breaks down, children are invariably caught in the middle. 46% of divorces in 2015 involved at least one child below 18. We know that it is not always easy to keep the family together. But we can mitigate some of these challenges. Acting early to support families to strengthen their bonds can help them stay together, especially when children are involved.

Things also will get complex when a transnational family experiences divorce, as there are cross-border issues. Let me share with you the story of a 10-year old girl whom we shall call Mei Mei. Mei Mei‚Äôs father was a foreigner, and her parents had a family business in China. Her parents often bickered over where was the best place to raise Mei Mei. Unfortunately, the business failed soon after Mei Mei became ill with epilepsy.

When her parents divorced, Mei Mei felt that she had been the cause of the divorce. After the divorce, Mei Mei was left in Singapore with her mother, who had to cope with the outstanding debts. Her father went on frequent travels to China with the hope of re-starting his business. He was not paying his maintenance on time and Mei Mei saw him irregularly. She felt that her father no longer loved her and blamed her illness as the start of all the bad luck.

It was only after the Supervised Visitation programme held at one of MSF‚Äôs appointed Divorce Support Specialist Agencies, that the family was better able to understand their hurts with the help of a counsellor. This safe platform allowed for the child to rebuild her trust in her father again. Her parents also learnt how to co-parent by putting Mei Mei‚Äôs interest first, so as to help the family move forward despite the divorce. Remember. You may not be husband and wife anymore. But you still remain a father and mother.

As we work with families who face divorce, we are aware of these increasingly complex circumstances facing the family. However, as in the case of Mei Mei, the welfare of the child is at the heart of our efforts and it must be so. We are hopeful that a collaborative system of support will lead to better outcomes for the children.

We must be compassionate in our approach when working with families who face conflict and crisis. The Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (DSSAs) support divorcing and divorced couples with children below 21. As new players in the delivery of family-centric services, they give the child a voice, and work with parents to fulfil their duties to their child even amidst conflict.

a. The staff from the DSSAs are counsellors and social workers equipped with specialist knowledge and skills to handle divorce issues. To ensure that the child‚Äôs interests are looked after, DSSAs offer programmes that adopt a child-centric approach, which help parents understand the impact of divorce on their children.

b. Counselling and support groups are also emplaced to ensure that parents can learn to co-parent better. In this way, we hope that the child can still thrive and become resilient even when the family has experienced the pain of divorce.

c. So MSF has set up a one-stop resource hub to facilitate seamless coordination of referrals between the Courts and MSF. This allows families affected by divorce to be supported immediately and effectively.

One of the new services that DSSAs will deliver is the mandatory parenting programme. From December 2016, divorcing parents with minor children who are not able to agree on all matters of the divorce have to attend this programme before they can file for divorce. The programme aims to guide parents to consider living arrangements, finances and housing arrangements post-divorce, and to increase parents‚Äô awareness of the impact of divorce on their children‚Äôs well-being. A secured online portal will also be launched in November 2016 as part of the implementation of this programme.

Future-ready policies that are attuned to the family

Finally, the third prong of our work in preserving families requires our social and justice systems to be future-ready.

Both policy and practice call for anticipating, and being prepared for emerging trends. Singapore‚Äôs families are no longer as large as they used to be. These days, most couples tend to have only 1 or 2 children, or none at all. With shrinking family sizes, families have fewer members to rely on for support.

We are also aging. By 2030, there will be over 900,000 residents aged 65 and above, a fair number of whom would be single or have no children. Elderly who develop dementia may be unable to care for themselves. This is especially worrying for those who are living alone ‚Äì this number is projected to increase from 35,000 in 2012 to 83,000 in 2030.

So it is even more important for family members, both immediate and extended, to maintain close ties with one another. As we grow older, our families will increasingly become our source of physical, emotional and financial support.

For our seniors, we are mindful that strengthening family ties among their siblings, nephews and nieces, is no easy feat. Our ground-observations point towards weaker extended family ties, and more seniors living alone. So, we need to do more to encourage a broader sense of family. We cannot force it, but it is something that is there, and we must encourage. We know social isolation can become a serious issue. It is not a problem, or an issue for those living alone. It is a problem for all. When we grow old, we can be socially isolated. It has an emotional, psychological impact, and, it impacts the physiological well-being as well.

But this is where our social system must think about how we deal with it. For one, I think we have a big strength in Singapore. I personally believe that the grassroots system is particularly important, where we can begin to develop the community networks well ‚Äì and I believe we do it today ‚Äì we develop the habit of reaching out to those amongst us who are older. And, we develop the habit of keeping people engaged, keeping people occupied, visiting and knowing how people are doing. I think this can go a very long way in addressing the concerns we may have. When we are mobile, we can travel, we can visit our families, our friends. But at some point we will become less mobile. And, our immediate neighbours become particularly important.

The other part of the social system that is equally important, in terms of how to support the vulnerable elderly, whose very safety is at risk, is actually the legal system. In this light, we will strengthen legislation where required. While family members will serve and must serve as the first line of protection for vulnerable adults, and, they must also be supported by a network of community and social service agencies, more legislative support must be rendered.

MSF will be tabling a proposed Vulnerable Adults Bill to allow the State to step in for high-risk cases, to protect and ensure the safety of the vulnerable adult.

I am referring here to a person over 18 years of age who is unable to protect himself from abuse, neglect or self-neglect, due to a physical or mental infirmity. He or she may be abused physically, sexually or psychologically. He or she may be neglected due to a lack of essential care, to the extent that injury or pain is caused or reasonably likely to be caused. Self-neglect is also conceptualised in this Bill, because the vulnerable adult may fail to care for himself. In such a case, we might find him living in unsanitary or hazardous conditions, malnourished or dehydrated.

So we should empower the social system to organise protective care around such persons. In high-risk cases where MSF would intervene, we need to work closely with community partners, and the families. We want to keep families intact as far as possible. We also want to ensure a safe environment for all its members.

It is early days yet, and our social system will be tested in terms of how ready our response would be in dealing with crisis-situations involving vulnerable adults in our community, and with the family that cares for them. The numbers will increase, the complexities will increase as well, but we must be prepared.

Conclusion

The three strategies and examples that I have shared demonstrate how tricky it is dealing with families-in-crisis.

Singapore has made important strides forward ‚Äì whether in legislation, family intervention strategy, or services for families. For that, I want to applaud the strong partnership within the network of systems that comprise the social welfare and family justice system in Singapore.

As we move forward, we need the courage to do right by our children, and preserve families in the process. I want to also underscore the importance of our social agencies and our social workers in being aware of what has been shown to work for families, and to continually adapt our practices to meet needs of the families we work with. We need sound, evidence-based methods that work best in our local context.

I also want us to ask ourselves a crucial and very practical question - How do we, through what we do, break the vicious cycles that we see occurring in some families? We must break those cycles.

We must enhance our social system to help families through their situations, to thrive again in a sustainable way. If we do this well, tomorrow‚Äôs families avoid the dysfunction triggered by conflict and crisis, because of the support we render today.

Let us commit to building a stronger social and justice system. With each passing day, we empower families to be strong, stable and to thrive. Thank you."

Touch down...Glad to be home! I just led a group of Singapore companies, predominantly SMEs, to visit Liaoning Province. This is a follow up from our 9th Singapore-Liaoning Economic and Trade Council conference in May this year. We have similar partnerships across the various regions (e.g. with Jiangsu, Guangzhou etc) and are ably supported by our passionate and hardworking officers from International Enterprise (I.E.) Singapore. We have two main objectives. Firstly, to help provide opportunities for our companies to expand into China, and to also help encourage investments into Singapore. This helps create jobs and opportunities for our people and support our domestic and external economy. Secondly, through these interactions, we continue to deepen our ties with China at the political and economic levels. Diplomatic space and strategic weight for this Little Red Dot do not happen magically. It comes from much effort to keep us relevant. 

My counterpart is Governor Chen Qiufa of Liaoning Province. I was also hosted to a call and dinner by Liaoning Party Secretary Li Xi, who by protocol is the senior man in the Province. They were warm and supportive of our presence. There are new and exciting opportunities in the NE region especially with the FTZ status and a new Shen-Fu development area, between Shenyang and Fu Shun cities. We'd have to see if our companies are keen and if we can play an active role in shaping part of the development in some ways. 

I also visited the smaller cities of Panjin and Benxi. Including Shenyang and Fu Shun, I was hosted by the mayors and unusually, by the Party Secretaries as well. I was glad to touch base with many of their leaders at the different levels. 

These visits allow our new companies to seek out fresh opportunities, reinforce links with officials and facilitate more business conversations. Importantly, our presence help to iron out kinks in the partnerships. How? I raise concerns directly to the leadership when warranted. Sometimes, the prospect of this also helps to smoothen the collaboration. Visiting companies or presiding over 'openings', sometimes with my counterparts, also help. 

We hope that more SMEs will explore the opportunities available. It is not easy, but there are exciting stories of how some of them are pushing the barriers.

Syahidah, a 2015 Asean Para Games double gold medallist, is also the first Singaporean archer to participate in these Games. She shared with me that the wind conditions were tricky in Rio, there were many lessons learned and she is aiming to build up her strength to cope better in these conditions.

182928775083239_1215720285137411,"Some of you ask me about issues we deal with. This is one. We have an ongoing dispute between two neighbours about a tree between their two properties. W asked us to help. We have been trying to mediate, reaching out to X but they aren't responding.

This email pops up from W:

""I would like to register my disappointment with the non response from your office.

My support of you and your office has greatly diminished as a result of the ill effort provided to my call for help.""

I was surprised as we had kept her in the loop on what was happening. Perhaps she wanted a personal email from me. I sent an email:

""I am surprised by your response. This is a dispute between neighbours and my colleagues have tried several times to address the issue by reaching out to your neighbour. They have refused to respond to our overtures. I myself had gone down to view the situation from another neighbour's house. My colleagues have also emailed to let you know of the situation. They went down to your place once but I believe you were away. We continue to try and reach out to them.""

W then responded:

""If you and your office can't be any help except to do what I have done, i.e. call their agent, then say so.

All I get are holding statements which are useless to me.

Anyway your statement says it all. A dispute between neighbours that you and your office cannot be of any help.""

Some disputes, when it doesn't violate particular laws or regulations, are civil in nature. If you don't want to engage lawyers, we try to mediate and outreach in various ways. My volunteers put in time to do this. Sometimes it works out well. Sometimes we can't make much headway. 

I hope our residents understand. Most do and have been appreciative, and to those who have been so, thanks for your understanding and appreciation.

(P.S. Add on in response to your comments:

A tree has grown that has caused some damage to the walls. The tenant of the unresponsive owner had also indicated that fault may lie with other side for damage. Who is right and wrong? As with all things, there would be a need to mediate. I understand the frustration which is why they asked us to help and why we have been trying. 
This is not the first instance where we have to manage disputing neighbours. When we raise an issue with another, we can get an earful from them for taking sides, or be told another side of the story, et al. It takes time and not always easy I'm afraid.)"

I spoke to a number of parents and individuals and was deeply encouraged by their responses. Clearly, we are on the right track and they feel it...so we must not let up and keep going! These are substantive and meaningful steps for the community at large. 

@WDASingapore also launched new categories of the @skillsfuturesg Study Award today, for persons with disabilities and disability employment professionals. I strongly encourage those who are interested to apply at the SkillsFuture website.

P.S. I had a long chat with some from the Muscular Dystrophy Association of Singapore (MDAS). Sometimes, individuals drop out of school and publics space even though they can remain and continue. Why? The individuals and/or families become disheartened, lose confidence in themselves, develop psychosomatic responses, begin to underperform because of mental blocks occurring etc. The journey back can be long drawn and emotionally draining. But we have seen how many have come out of their shells and re-integrated back into society. And contributing beautifully! I saw their works and know where they were just a few years back. This journey towards greater inclusiveness will include many different efforts and one such effort is like the Make the Change Integration Programme where we saw this transformation happen!

Sports is a great way for families to build stronger bonds by having quality and quantity time together. The different kinds of sports provide parents with opportunities to guide them in developing important core values such as resilience, integrity and teamwork.
 
For many fathers in particular, sports is one of the most natural and effective tools of communication. Whether it is bonding over our favourite football team, or shooting hoops at the neighbourhood court, we fathers need to make conscious efforts to spend time and connect with our families, to show them that they are important to us.

182928775083239_1210525792323527,"We had a very useful session at the G7 Kobe Health Ministers' Meeting. This is the first time  we have been invited to a G7 session and we had a meaningful discussion on ageing issues. I co-chair our Ministerial Committee on Ageing with Kim Yong and shared with G7 members on what we were doing here in SG. It was interesting to see how much we have in common with others. We are making useful progress but it is imperative that not only there be a whole-of-government effort, there needs to be a whole-of-society effort as well. We are focusing on the individual, community and nation. For example, how do we help individuals be engaged, whether at work, socially, in terms of lifelong learning etc. At the community level, we want to see how we can mobilize our local community to look out for our fellow neighbours, how we become more accepting of those who are older. And at the national level, it is also about laws like the Vulnerable Adults Act, physical accessibility and so on. The key is to look at longevity as a golden opportunity, for us all to live long and age well.

I had good dialogues with our Japanese host, Minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki, German Minister Hermann Gr√∂he, Canadian Minister Dr Jane Philpott and also French Minister Marisol Touraine. Director General World Health Organisation Margaret Chan was keen to find out about our efforts on Zika and clearly, she and her team had a lot of confidence in the way we were handling and addressing the issue. They recognized that given the nature of Zika, especially when 80% of those affected are asymptomatic, as in not displaying symptoms, it is not quite possible to contain it. They are keen to be briefed further by our folks on what we have found out thus far. 

I have not had much interaction with health officials from other countries but I found the responses by many to be very encouraging. Many are experienced officials who have worked with our people and they came forward to say hello and to express their sentiments about what they have learnt about us. Our health outcomes and system are well regarded. 

I know my health colleagues are not satisfied with where we are and feel that we can and must still improve. But I just want to say to our friends in MOH and the healthcare sector ""well done and keep up the good work""! GAMBATTE!"

The PDP supports pre-school teachers at every stage of their career, by allowing them to take up courses and upgrade themselves.  Today, ECDA has opened nominations for the second intake of the PDP.  We‚Äôve added mother tongue language courses to the PDP, so that teachers can be trained to better help children pick up languages in their early years.
 
Very glad to learn that the response and feedback from the first intake has been positive and encouraging.  I hope more centres will nominate their teachers for the programme, so that we could continue to provide good quality pre-school education to our children.

This afternoon, my volunteers and I went to the area to help raise awareness amongst my residents about Zika and also to remind residents not to be overly panic and they have to continue to be vigilant. The fight against Dengue and Zika infection are largely similar as they are both transmitted by the bite of the female Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes.

Residents should monitor their health, especially pregnant women.  They should seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially if they display symptoms of fever and rash.

Residents should also continue to monitor information released by MOH and NEA for the latest updates.

Combating Dengue and Zika is a community effort. Everyone has a role to play in preventing these diseases when preventive measures are taken diligently.

I have extracted the key portions for ease of reading for our residents living near Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive, and ‚ÄòOther Areas of Concern‚Äô, namely Joo Chiat Place and Lor 101 Changi Road, this is what you need to note.

Monitoring of Health

We advise those living or working in the affected area of Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive and the other areas of concern, especially pregnant women, to monitor their health. They should seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially with symptoms of fever and rash. They should also inform their doctors of the location of their residence and workplace.

FAQs and impact on pregnant women:
http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/faq-planning-for-children/3089286.html
Vector Control

Let us all take immediate steps to prevent mosquito breeding in our homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout and protect ourselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellent regularly. Meanwhile NEA will intensify vector control operations in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive.

Ongoing Screening and Testing

MOH will continue to screen the close contacts of confirmed cases. MOH is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive area and other areas of concern who have symptoms of fever and rash. In particular, MOH has worked with the contractors at a construction site at Sims Drive to screen the workers there who were recently reported by a general practitioner (GP) to have symptoms of fever, rash and conjunctivitis. 

MOH has also alerted all GPs, polyclinics and hospitals to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH.

What are Zika‚Äôs Effects?

Zika is generally a mild disease and many people infected with the Zika virus do not even develop symptoms. Like dengue, it is transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito.

Zika virus infection can however cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. Pregnant women should adopt strict mosquitoes precaution if travelling to an affected area. Individuals working, studying or living in an affected area who are sexual partners of pregnant women should adopt safe sexual practices (e.g. consistent and correct use of condoms during sex) or consider abstinence throughout the women‚Äôs pregnancy.

It's very encouraging that many parents surveyed indicate that their most important priority is on values and character development.

Better still, join in and also lead by example. In fact, it can be a family activity to do good together. If you think about it, not difficult to do right?

182928775083239_1193869397322500,"I am very glad that Sudha Nair has been recognized as Her World Woman of the Year! She has been an outstanding social worker and this is well deserved. This recognition is also very much an endorsement of social workers and the work they do. üëç

Help share Sudha's meaningful acceptance speech attached below. Well done!
-----------------

Thank you so much, Her World for this enormous honour. To find myself placed in the ranks of eminent Singapore women such as Professor Chan Heng Chee, Ms Claire Chiang, Dr Kanwaljit Soin and Madam Halimah Yacob is unbelievable. My achievements are nowhere near theirs. But by choosing a social worker, you recognise my profession ‚Äì one that‚Äôs often underestimated and regarded as little more than a soft option for kind, good-hearted people who hand out financial aid and food rations and visit the needy. Social workers do much more, operating at the point where personal troubles and public issues intersect. Our goal is to help people solve problems, and cope and function effectively. Where resources are needed, we help locate them. 

Social work is primarily a female dominated profession although more men are coming now and, Mr SR Nathan Singapore‚Äôs most distinguished social worker had the dubious honour of having as his first job title ‚Äú Lady Almoner‚Äù, what we now refer to as a medical social worker. He carried it well and took it in good humour. 

A key social work task is to advocate for change to policies and services, identify gaps that need to be addressed, and ensure that the delivery of social services is humane, accountable and efficient. 

Mr Nathan embodied this . He was perhaps the first and only social work student whose diploma thesis led to the starting of a government department. Mr Nathan had been studying the lascars, these were sailors from South Asia. Most of them were Bangladeshis who took the lowest paying jobs on ships. What he found was that they were very badly treated and when they landed they were paid a pittance. And they were bonded to the owner of the boarding house that they lived at in Tanjong Pagar , who could dictate the jobs they took on, sometimes even forcing them to carry opium. In effect they were bonded slaves with no rights. Jean Robertson, Head of the Social Work Dept at University Malaya, showed the thesis to the then Chief Minister David Marshall who was horrified at how these labourers were treated. He set up a Seaman Registry where anyone who wanted to employ a seaman had to go through the registry to ensure that they were taken care of. Mr Nathan‚Äôs thesis highlighted the personal troubles of these lascars that had became a public issue. Chief Minister Marshall appointed him the first Seaman‚Äôs Welfare Officer. 

This perhaps sowed the seeds for his career in public service and the labour movement. The skills he learnt in Social Work - engagement, negotiation, listening, assessment were skills that were to last him a lifetime. He cared for people from the start of his career, right through his last days. He exemplified the values of social work He will be missed. 

My introduction to social work was not as dramatic as Mr Nathan‚Äôs. I came to social work because it looked like the most interesting course in the NUS prospectus after English Literature, and graduated in 1986. My first job was with the Ang Mo Kio Social Service Centre. Back in the late 80‚Äôs social work was one of the poorest paid jobs for graduates. My salary was $1,050 and my first increment was $15. 

A common perception was that you did not need a degree to do social work. Parents could not see why their children would go to university only to end up working with the poor, needy and dangerous for so little money. I stayed at the Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centre for 18 years and the work I did there led to the setting up of PAVE. Looking back, that was perhaps the best and most creative period of my life.

Thank you for allowing me to put the spotlight today on family violence. To me, family violence is terrorism in the home. Spouses, intimate partners, children or the elderly are terrorised behind closed doors, living in fear 24/7. The people you love who are supposed to love you back are instead your tormentors. You continually walk on eggshells, terrified of sparking a violent episode. All this IN your home. And you feel you cannot tell anyone. 

At PAVE, we like to think of our clients as survivors rather than victims. Most survivors seeking help at PAVE are women who have been abused by their husbands. Some are scarred and disfigured for life. Some have come close to losing their lives. Many have no confidence or self-esteem. 

When I think of the women, I think of Grace. She was 58 years old when I first met her. Married for more than 30 years, she finally decided to get out of her very abusive relationship and divorced her husband. A year after the divorce her ex-husband went to her HDB block and slashed her so badly that she described her stitched-up face as a ‚Äújigsaw puzzle‚Äù. Her ex-husband was jailed, but he told her he would never let her go. She lived in terror that he would come out of jail and attack her again. I placed Grace in a group of women survivors and there, she realised she was not alone. We developed a community safety plan with the prisons, the police, the grassroots and the MP which succeeded in keeping her safe. Grace went on to remarry, and she exemplifies our belief that there IS life after violence. As she puts it: ‚ÄúAfter 30 years of abuse I can finally smile again.‚Äù 

Children who are exposed to violence in their home need help too, but it is so hard to reach out to them. What they experience in a violent home can haunt them for the rest of their lives. 

I met Kelly when she was nine years old. Her mother was a survivor of violence and Kelly would accompany her to PAVE. She seemed cheerful, but her mother complained that she was doing poorly in school. When I talked to Kelly, I found that the girl was herself a victim, and it was her mother who abused her. Her mother would denigrate Kelly constantly, curse her for being born, blame her for the physical abuse that she received from her father, spew vulgarities at her and physically abuse her. Kelly could not sleep at night, and could not concentrate in school. All she could think of was how to survive the day. 

During one of our sessions, I asked Kelly, if she were an animal what animal she would like to be. Other children usually say they would like to be a tiger, lion or dragon. Kelly thought for a very long time and then said: ‚ÄúAnt!‚Äù When I asked why, she said: ‚ÄúSo that people would step on me and I can go to God!‚Äù Her grandfather had recently died and he had been her protector; with him gone she lost all hope and wanted to be with him too. 

Social workers like to celebrate the resilience of human beings who are able to survive the most awful experiences and, with help, pull their lives together again. Children who are exposed to violence really need help early.PAVE will be starting the third Child Protection Specialist Centre in January 2017. 

In my 22 years in this field, most of the perpetrators have been men. Most are not monsters, but somewhere along the line they learnt it is all right to batter their wives. The men who come to PAVE for Mandatory Counselling range in age from their 20s to 60s. They include polytechnic and university graduates, men in well-paying jobs. It is equally important to work with those who use the violence, and show them this behaviour can be un-learnt. Men who truly value their families do learn to live their lives differently, without violence. 

We also need to be vigilant to elder abuse as Singapore is ageing rapidly. It‚Äôs hard for the elderly to complain against their abusers who may be their children. The number of such cases may not be large today, but we can expect more in the years to come and must be alert to help. 

People sometimes ask how I can go to work each day and face the horrible situations that our clients present. Seeing people in emotional or physical pain bothers me tremendously. But I also see people turn their lives around, smile again, and keep their families together. I see a wife-batterer put violence behind him, and become a PAVE ambassador who brings other men for help. I see the child who had the worst childhood imaginable graduating and knowing that although life tossed her a rotten deal, having support from people who cared, enabled change. All this gives me a real high that I‚Äôm hooked on! 

Today, new social work graduates are paid considerably more, but the work remains challenging, exciting, meaningful and rewarding. There is nothing better than walking down the street and meeting an ex-client who stops to chat, then thanks you once again for being there and making a difference at a critical point of her life. 

Social work requires heart, but neither a soft nor a calloused one. Many practitioners are strong and resolute, as working with families in crisis is no easy task. The profession needs critical thinkers, creative people to innovate and find pathways for clients when every door appears closed. A social worker needs courage, a great sense of optimism, and the ability to reframe negative situations to positive ones. A large dose of humour and having supportive colleagues are essential, and I have been blessed with both over the years.
 
There are many people that I have to thank tonight but I shall do so personally. But there is one group of people whom I am very grateful to, our clients, who trusted us enough to share their often painful stories with us. They have been our greatest teachers and it is such a privilege to have been a part of their lives. 

Receiving this award is an immense honour, but there‚Äôs still plenty of work to be done. We continue to hope that protection will be extended to unmarried people in dating and live-in relationships. We have to keep inspiring bright young people to devote their lives to this worthy profession. Thank you once more for recognising what we do, and for giving a voice to all our families who live with violence."

There was a slight twist in this BCC though. I was asked to join in a Physical Training  session where everyone was introduced to a new PT regime. I was clearly not thinking straight when I agreed! :) 
A lot of sports science had gone into this effort. Essentially, we just have to keep moving and doing the various exercises in about 30-45 minutes. Just keep the heart rate going...about 70% of max HR. The individual exercises include movement that mimic things you may need to do on the battlefield. It is as tiring as it is briefly described here! But I do believe in this. It's more multi-dimensional in nature. And early indicators show that soldiers' injury rates had gone down whilst fitness levels have risen.

It was rather painful! But am keen to do more of these sets!

182928775083239_1191311320911641,"Rest in Peace Mr Nathan. üò¢

It is with a heavy heart that we mourn the loss of former President Mr S R Nathan today. As a dear friend and visionary leader of the social service sector, Mr Nathan had touched many lives in Singapore.
 
16 years ago, when Mr Nathan founded the President‚Äôs Challenge in 2000, it was with a vision to build a more caring and cohesive Singapore, where each and every one of us would do our part to help the less fortunate around us. Today, the social service sector continues to work and build on the strong foundations that Mr Nathan had laid.
 
Mr Nathan‚Äôs passion for the causes in the social service sector ‚Äì caring for the disabled, families in distress, vulnerable children and youths and those with mental illnesses ‚Äì was well known. Truly a ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs President‚Äù, his selfless care and deep compassion for the ordinary man came through each time he met with Singaporeans from all walks of life.  Mr Nathan also believed strongly in giving people dignity through earning their own living even as they received help, and was a strong advocate for educating and equipping Singaporeans with skills to earn a living.

A few days ago, while celebrating the life and contribution of 90 year old Ann Wee, she shared that he was the only person she knew whose work grew an entire Government setup. His thesis on the Welfare of Seafarers as a social work student helped to provide substance to the setting up of a dedicated department of social work (previously it was dept of social work and psychology.)

Bee Lian, Director of Social Welfare, shared with me that he even invited her for a private lunch to discuss a child with disability and how our systems could better support families. This is the extent of his caring and incisive efforts to make the lives of others much better through social work and systems.

I experienced this individual warmth too. I could still remember fondly how Mr Nathan wanted to call on me at my office. He said it was the right thing to do since he is no longer President. Of course, I went to visit him instead.  He had willingly shared this thoughts on doing good and serving the needs of the disadvantaged.  I was grateful for his generosity and struck by his humility.
 
Mr Nathan has left us with an indelible legacy.  I hope that the warm memories, thoughts and prayers of his friends and those whom he had touched, will bring his family and close friends a measure of comfort at this difficult time.  He will be dearly missed, and fondly remembered by all of us.

But I believe PM felt it important as our leader to finish what he set out to do and to also assure a nation. 

This graphic, I believe, captures the reason why PM does what he does. Every day, over the years. Along with his colleagues and the many public servants, and the many Singaporeans who do care about building a better home not just for self, but for all of us.

I saw this posted by Lee Amizadai:

""For 10 mins, much of the nation waited with bated breath, hands over our mouths, hearts thudding in unison; ""please be ok, please be ok, we love you, we love you"". 

The ones who could pray, did. Hard. 

The news came, he's ok. It's nothing serious. 

For some, he's been an easy man to idolise; to others, an easy man to hate and blame. But then we saw a giant sway and go down, and if 50.39 seconds united as a nation breathing as one felt long, 10 minutes felt interminable, especially in the face that things might forever be different. 

But he's ok, we sigh, he's ok. Everything's fine, he's probably just tired, burdened. 

But maybe we need to know he will not always be ok. Maybe we need to know the burden is ours too.""

Indeed. 
Singapore is for all of us to build together.

But the older one ran away from the Home previously, but we managed to bring her in again. We have known them for some time. Wonderful girls. But unfortunately, family circumstances left much to be desired. Single mum, different fathers. 

As you know, we have a volunteer program where we meet our kids every Thursday and Sunday. Homework Club. Part of our KidZcare outreach. We help with reading, homework and to bring the kids out with the objective of befriending and offering another avenue to connect with our young. We pick up issues early and the idea is to intervene positively and early if needed. 

We realized that they were not attending school regularly. And the trigger was when I heard that the eldest didn't go for her PSLE. 
Our volunteers, social workers, school principal and teachers, child protection officers began to come onto the case. 
Long and short of it, the kids were taken away in large part also because we found the mother abusing drugs. 

It's heartbreaking because they need all the love they can get. And a stable home environment. But it's not to be. I'm glad they have adjusted well and started in their new schools. They were in good spirits and asked for Joseph Schooling's autograph! The social worker too actually üòÑ

It is something that we have been working on for some time and addresses important needs in the employment scene. Well done Singapore Ministry of Manpower and stakeholders who have given their inputs to shape this!

The key things for me is this. The Employment Act covers many of our employees. With our last increase a few years back to $4500, coverage had actually increased significantly. However, those earning above that have fewer options. The civil route is available but may be costly. The ECT (Employment Claims Tribunal) helps to cover more PMEs for salary claims and disputes.

""Besides hearing more types of claims, the ECT will be accessible to more employees compared to the existing Labour Court. Besides hearing statutory salary-related claims from employees covered under the EA, RRA and CDCA, the ECT will also hear contractual salary-related claims from more employees, including PMEs who earn more than $4,500 per month and are currently beyond the coverage of the EA. With this, all employees can now have access to the ECT for their statutory and/or contractual salary-related disputes.""

Want to take the opportunity to thank my activists and volunteers for holding the fort while I was away. I am particularly glad to see our volunteers beginning to take ownership and drive more and more initiatives aimed at bringing our community together. For this year's National Day Observance Ceremony, we invited many Singaporeans who have special needs to be with us and it made it all the more meaningful.

Am also grateful to my colleagues at MSF. The wonders (or curse...depending on how you see it!) of modern technology means that we continue with our other responsibilities even while we may be half way round the world...am just grateful for them who sometimes get my emails at unearthly hours. Come to think of it, they are getting emails from me at unearthly hours even while I'm home! :)

Thanks too to my team who continue to lead and manage our team well in Rio. It is not easy navigating the various challenges, but they have done a great job on that front. Our athletes continue to compete, though we are now left with our sailors completing their races and one more Bronze-medal match for table tennis. I'd stayed on longer than I have for any tournament so far and have met all our athletes and visited most to support them in action. Some asked why did I leave early. I was always scheduled to leave on 13th as I have other duties to also to attend to. Rarely would we be able to stay throughout any games. It was a bonus though that Jo came back with me on the same flight. I'm also proud of all 25 of or athletes and their hard work and efforts.

It is a real blessing to have dedicated teams on the different fronts in which I operate...ground-community, Ministry and sports.

Will post the high res version shortly. For some strange reason, can't connect! Grrrr. But it also allowed me to really savour the moment. And so many moments to savour!!!

Good start! And then being in the lead. Still close. And when he began to pull away and it began to look like it really is happening, the heart could barely take it. 

And of course. The Majulah Singapura moment. Sweet. Felt so proud. Grace Fu and I and everyone was just delirious and screaming our heads off. The folks around us were just so happy for us too. 

WOW. What a way to end my stay here...

Well done Joseph Schooling. üá∏üá¨

But we have come to learn that we always need to be vigilant and not take things for granted. Crime is no trivial matter here. Some hear gunshots going off in the middle of the night. 

This is a country with huge potential. But when one thinks of the scale and magnitude of the challenges, it certainly isn't easy. Hope they can stabilize politically and eventually economically. This is imperative for them, so as to be able to uplift the lives of average Brazilians."

From all your messages, it seems everyone back home is gripped by the excitement of Joseph Schooling's race tonight. Some pausing meetings, students gather round to watch...wow!I know we all have expectations and the build up has been very positive and very hopeful...Asian Record, fastest time this year, fastest finalist... (be calm my heart...!!)

However, I am reminded of this story, attached below, that is making its rounds. No idea if it's true, but a nice little reminder about how we set ourselves up for happiness or not.

I had decided before this games that I will support our athletes and cheer for them regardless of outcome. In many ways, they are already winners in getting here. Achieving their personal bests would have been great. To medal...that would truly be a precious gift. We have 25 winners here.

Joseph is already a winner and we will cheer him on regardless of result. We wish, we hope. But I have decided that it's just going to be a great finals and to see our first ever swimmer there competing with the best...what a joy!

182928775083239_1182470905129016,"We are early at the pool. Awaiting Zhengwen Quah and Joseph Schooling in the 100m Butterfly heats. Fingers X! 

Met up with Jasmine Ser earlier after her shoot. She was understandably disappointed. She had put aside everything to gear up for the games but it was not to be. She felt that she just couldn't get going and will have to take stock, learn and come back stronger. It happens to the best. The current world champion didn't make it to the final 8 either. 

It's the same for all our athletes isn't it? For some, things can turn in the blink of an eye. It doesn't matter how well you did before. It comes down to the moment. Imagine all the years of effort building up to this. Would it be ecstasy or a big disappointment?

I have come to respect our athletes for the phenomenal hardwork and sacrifices put in to compete at the highest levels. To qualify for the Olympics is an important achievement. It's a reflection of the hours put in every day, every week, every month. For years. It requires discipline, determination, fighting spirit to avoid taking the easier route. It takes courage to deal with the many disappointments that will come their way. Injuries. Bad luck. Poor performances. Doubts expressed by those around them. Hurtful comments by others. It takes strength and character to pick themselves up and go again. And again. And again. 

I know we all have our expectations. And views about how one should play better, run faster, jump higher. Or what one should say or not say. But we are not ""the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust, sweat and blood, who strives valiantly...""

I will cheer them on regardless of expectation or result. Encourage them where I can. To provide a listening ear if needed. I know they want to do well more than any of us. And I know they feel the disappointment even more. Especially when they know they are flying our flag and carrying the burden of expectations of many. 

I do want to know what went wrong. Why. What we can do to correct it and improve. And to ensure we compete better the next time round. There will be lessons learnt. And perhaps at times, criticisms will be due. But there is a time and place for everything. While our athletes are out there still competing and flying our flag, the least I can do is to give them my all by cheering them on. 

Let's support #OneTeamSG!

Fukuhara played very well and Tianwei found it difficult to up her game to respond adequately. Mengyu had a very exciting match against the North Korean Kim Song I who is a very strong 'chopper' and who mixes in her offensive play quite effectively. There were nail-bitingly long rallies but Mengyu couldn't defeat her opponent despite her best efforts. They need to be ready now for the team games starting in a few days time.

Control measures can only go so far. Too many and it becomes onerous and less agile, too few and you run the risks of abuse. It is ultimately our values that must guide us in all our actions to serve Singapore and Singaporeans with integrity and compassion. I am proud that many of our officers serve with passion and dedication. But the Ministry will not condone or tolerate any conduct that undermines the integrity of our social assistance system and interest of our beneficiaries.

Met many residents at the Town Night @ Kembangan this evening. Glad to see the residents mingling at the carnival. Having a kampong spirit gives our neighbourhood the cosiness of home.

For other issues that affect our living environment, like maintenance of roads and footpaths, water quality, we can alert the agencies through the OneService app. No need to know which agency is in charge. Take a photo, geotag it, then send.

We have been reading news of abuse cases and a number of those affected are the elderly. As more of our population ages, there will be more vulnerable elderly among us who are susceptible to abuse or neglect. Sometimes, they may not be taking care of themselves very well too.
 
The family will always be the first line of support for vulnerable adults. Social service agencies and the community will complement this effort. When passed, the Vulnerable Adults Act will allow us to step in for high risk cases, when it becomes necessary to protect and ensure the safety of the vulnerable adult.

182928775083239_1165612196814887,"An unusually long session at the MPS at Marine Parade this evening.

Before MPS, I dropped by my resident's place. Her mother was elderly and ill, and she made a special request. I told her that I would make it happen. She came again, rather unhappy. It'd only been a week or so and I was trying to make the necessary arrangements. I have to admit that I was quite taken aback by her tone. I told her that I was following up but it wasn't ready. While she was hostile, I figured I should drop by her place to pass her the items. Really glad I did. She had been very stressed out as a care-giver. I spent a long time talking to her and old mum who was in pain and clearly quite distressed at her own condition. She has had a hard life, and to be now in this condition, it was heart-rending to listen to her and her sense of hopelessness. I tried my best to encourage her and for her to be well enough so that we could make some special arrangements for her. I think we should be able to swing something. I just hope that she would be well enought to take part. The family has had various setbacks and their story is quite poignant. They are managing but will keep them on our radar screen. 

At MPS, I encountered a family of 12 living in a rental flat. 12! I was also quite worried to hear that the 5-year old son has not been attending any school and one of the older child had just dropped out midway through secondary school. I need to check if they are already being supported and we need to get some solutions worked out. ASAP.

Met a young lady who had a condition. She is well able but companies shied away from her. And even worse, one passed rather hurtful comments. I want to find out what company that was. No laws were broken...but seriously...totally insensitive. Can't guarantee jobs, but will ask WDA and SGEnable to assist.

What I am reminded of: Caregiver respite, engaging despondent elderly, hunting down chronic social cases, ensuring children stay in school, keep working on an inclusive culture.

UPDATE: Followed up on family of 12. Good that social worker has been working with family and is familiar with them. Why 12?...relatives come and go, some have homes elsewhere. But clearly some dysfunctionalities. Child Protection had stepped in before. I'd need more details but am feeling somewhat more assured today than yesterday.

Event organizer will link up with my resident and mum and assist. Thumbs up! Just hope she is well enough to attend.

Linked up with WDA and SGEnable. Hope we can make progress.

182928775083239_1165453873497386,"The SGfuture engagements, which concluded in early July, affirmed the commitment of Singaporeans to build a shared future together and grow partnerships to create a caring and inclusive community. I was very heartened by the discussions that took place during the Caring Community sessions.  There are certainly many of us who would want to do more to help others and contribute to the communities around us.
 
Having attended some sessions, I saw first-hand the enthusiasm of Singaporeans as they came together to exchange ideas, brainstorm ground-up and co-creation projects with government and community organisations, and willingly volunteered their time, effort and skills to meaningful causes from helping the elderly to low-income families and vulnerable groups.
 
Our efforts do not stop with the conclusion of SGfuture. It is just the beginning of our journey to make Singapore a more caring and compassionate society. All of us ‚Äì citizens, community partners and government ‚Äì must work together to bring more meaningful and impactful help to those in need. Building on the momentum of SGfuture, we hope to realise a nation-wide push towards greater and more impactful volunteerism.
 
Giving should become a way of life and we can do much more to grow the kindness many Singaporeans already demonstrate to one other. As we begin to get involved, as we begin to actively care and as we begin bring on more volunteers both in the community and in the corporate space, we will realise that it is not just about helping the less fortunate around us, but also helping ourselves as a society.  Only then, will we start to build the more compassionate and inclusive society that we would like to see, and become the kind of people we want to be.

182928775083239_1164727446903362,"I joined my residents on a one-day durian trip to JB on Sunday as well as to make an official visit to the Deputy Home Affairs Minister's Hari Raya Open House. It was a good visit as we discussed a range of issues including security concerns we all faced. 

I travelled by bus so that I could be with my residents and volunteers during the trip. It is not easy to plan for and organize these trips, especially when there are so many people and when our residents visited various locations. But our grassroots leaders did a great job and it was a meaningful experience for most, if not all our residents. 

At day's end, I bid farewell to every resident and sent them off after dinner. One by one we dispatched the 20 buses as they proceeded independently back to the different alighting points, so that residents didn't have to commute too far to get home. We tracked the progress with the respective bus ICs.

On the return journey, ICA facilitated the clearance for me and my security officers who were carrying their firearms, as well as the residents and volunteers who were with me on my bus. 

Our ICA officers do not have an easy responsibility. Cross border traffic at the causeway is one of the highest in the world. They have to maintain security while also trying to ensure a smooth flow of people entering and departing daily. I know because I too have been in the queues when on personal trips.

I had the impression Mr Png waited a very long time. He also lamented about old folks having difficulties in the queues. ICA checked their cameras to ascertain the waiting time. He carefully omits to mention that he waited for all of 30 mins. I actually bumped into Louis Ng too. He and his delegation were also in the queue for about half an hour or so.
 
Mr Png seems to accept that it's reasonable that our office holders get facilitated, if so, then surely the others in that bus need to be cleared as well so that the bus can leave and not add to the vehicular queues there. 

But the purpose of his post, and that of his compatriots, was clear. It was not about the old folks. It was aimed at stirring hate and anger, not only to be directed at me, which I can understand politically, but also at my residents and volunteers (who organised as well as helped guide each bus), as well as our officers who secure our borders. It's unfortunate that he and his colleagues chose to politicise the issue.
 
Mr Png knows that it is standard procedure, all around the world, that Ministers, both from the home country and from visiting countries, get facilitated through immigration. When our Ministers visit overseas officially, they get facilitated, and likewise when Ministers from overseas visit us, they also get facilitated. 
 
And oh, by the way, any traveler who requires special assistance can approach our ICA officers on duty. I believe it is more effective and real to assist our fellow Singaporeans in this way."

Since it was set up in July 2013, the agency has been working hard with multiple stakeholder groups to ensure that Singaporeans with disabilities have access to relevant services and employment, as well as promoting social inclusion as a whole.
 
In 2015, SG Enable has helped 13,500 persons with disabilities through information and referral to disability services, financial assistance schemes, and training and employment efforts. On top of that, they have also supported 1,000 HR professionals, co-workers, disability employment professionals through training courses and Disability Management workshops.
 
On my visit, I spotted some seniors from the Lengkok Bahru/Redhill neighbourhood taking part in fitness activities at the Enabling Village, and had a chat with them. They told me that the activities were designed in collaboration with Republic Polytechnic, and supported by Standard Chartered Bank Singapore. Very happy to see the community come together to help our seniors keep fit and active!

182928775083239_1161073533935420,"Parents, do read to your child as much as possible and for as long as you can till they outgrow the activity. I read to these kids yesterday and realized how much I missed the time when I used to read to my children! Reading isn't just about learning words. It's about inculcating the love of reading, to use one's imagination (the book Chalk had no words at all, but it presented a great opportunity to have fun!), to explore related ideas beyond what the words describe, to ask 'why', to enact, to create one's own follow on stories...the list goes on. But perhaps most importantly, it's a time where parent and child can interact, have fun, and to build a relationship for life.

Too often, we are caught up in the rat race. I am not even talking about time away from the kids. In fact some of us are in the race to send our children from one enrichment lesson to another. To what end? Are we outsourcing our roles? Aren't we sometimes missing out on our part in our children's growth and development? 

Especially at a younger age, education isn't just about gaining skills and knowledge. We all know that these are the formative years where their brains develop the fastest...who should they be 'absorbing' from? Clearly, it is the parental interaction in that process that is most important. And we can enable ourselves to carry out some of these activities. Question is: Would we be prepared to spend that time to learn and prepare ourselves to teach or is it easier to pay someone else to do it? 

Our children grow up way too fast. Be there. Be present. Before you know it, they will be already 18 and 14...like mine! Then it will be another set of wonderful experiences as they grow into young adulthood. Parenthood, a lifetime of unique memorable adventures!

Today's dialogue touched on many issues: what does it take to be inclusive, to care for others, to volunteer, work-life balance, stress, pay and salary, affordability of living in Singapore, opportunities in the future, foreigners in the economy, LGBT issues, over-usage of smart devices et al. Whew! It is good that young people are thinking of these questions and looking ahead. At the same time, I shared that we also need to be clear about what really matters, the choices we must make, our expectations versus reality gap, and to think about not only pursuing our passion but also to be passionate about what we do, even if that wasn't what we set out for in the first place.  

As a government, we are committed to providing the essential basics - affordable homes, education, healthcare and good job opportunities - so that we can all have options to pursue what matters to us.  
 
While in some sense the future can appear uncertain because of the pace of change, especially of technology and its impact on our lives, choices and opportunities have never been more exciting. The future beckons and we are well poised to embrace it.  

But ultimately, even as we work hard at paving the way for our future, let us also not forget about those among us who are in need of help. When we care for those around us, we are in reality beginning to build a different society. Caring, compassionate and one that focuses on the community and not just self. 

Very much enjoyed the later conversations that went on for some time over coffee as well...glad to meet you all at NYP! :)"

It was 1973. Singapore hosted the 7th SEA Peninsular Games. Our very first international sports meet held in our new National Stadium.  Mr C. Kunalan had the honour of running into the stadium, torch aloft, ascending the steps and lighting the cauldron. 

I learnt something from Lim Teck Yin, CEO SportSG last week, when we were with Mr K. What many didn't know was that as he was holding the torch, fuel had flowed down to his hands. Along with that the flame. His hands were being burnt even as he held the torch up high. He held it tight and refused to let go until he carried out his responsibility. He didn't want to let Singapore down. A few days later, while running the relay, he had to use his other hand to carry the baton as his right hand couldn't grip because of the burns.

No sporting stage gets quite as big as the Olympics and the Paralympics. Some of our athletes are already amongst the who's who in the circuit. Pin Xiu for example is a world record holder. Tianwei was recently seeded number two. Joseph Schooling has been making waves in his events. Others compete hard and are making progress. Saiyidah's grit and never-say-die attitude is a solid example for many. And even more remarkable are our para athletes who deal with even more life's challenges along with the sporting ones. Many will not be medalling but I hope that they will be able to perform well and to the best of their abilities, hopefully to better their Personal Bests, and to be good solid ambassadors for Singapore. 

These are a wonderful bunch of young Singaporeans whom we can all be proud of.

182928775083239_1156947861014654,"I spent an interesting morning yesterday at National Junior College chatting with 280 Senior High 2 students.
 
We discussed some issues close to the heart, including caring for those among us who may be less fortunate, those with special needs and the disadvantaged. It was very heartening to see them challenge themselves, and actively think about and reflect on some of these very real issues that we face in society today.
 
I posed these questions to the students:
 
1.       How important is it to build a caring and compassionate society?
2.       Why do you think it is important?
3.       What can I do to bring about the change?
 
It is pertinent that we think about these questions if we want to live in a society that truly cares, where we could reconnect with our values for loving and caring for other.  All of us, not just students, need to constantly reflect and think about ways to step forward and make a difference, and to not just think about 'me' but to start thinking beyond ourselves and embrace the 'we'. Only then can we start to nurture and build a more caring, compassionate and inclusive society.

182928775083239_1155872164455557,"This is the first time I've seen this vehicle! When I was back in G5  The Singapore Army, (or Army Plans), this was a newly initiated project. Just sketches then...! One of the key features was to build it with networked capabilities at its core. How to best leverage on information both as a individual fighting vehicle, as a team and as part of a broader system. Along the way, another networked platform, the Terrex had come into being and is now being considered by the US Marine Corps and possibly Australian Army.  

The progress made is really the effort of our engineers in the Defence Science and Technology Agency, our Singapore Technology partners and our weapons staff officers (specialists who help provide the operator-DSTA-industry interface) and our troopers who provide their inputs from the M113 Ultras to the Bionix to the Terrex...And of course, I'd be surprised if there aren't 'stuff' from Defence Science Organisation...things that we often can't talk about! :)

Technologies developed for this are often applied elsewhere as are spinoffs from other ongoing projects. 

Security remains important, especially for small countries. Over the years, the conventional warfare needs remain, but the less conventional terror threats have also increased. Maintaining a capable and credible deterrence is key. It provides us a stable base from which other activities can take place and for us to live our lives peacefully.

And before that, there was Istanbul and the list goes on. At the same time we are assailed by moronic actions like the anti-Islamic politicians in Australia and the US, just as we are witnessing the increase in Islamophobia in post-BREXIT UK. 

For many of us who have been privileged to spend time with our Muslim friends as they broke fast, we know that these are absolutely the wrong images and messages to be associated with Ramadan, and Islam

I was particularly struck by Darren Soh's image and post and I wanted to share it here. 

""On the last night of Terawih Prayers before Ramadan comes to an end for our Muslim friends, I had the privilege to witness and photograph how the men who built our houses practise their faith. Many of the construction workers in Singapore are Bangladeshi, and many Bangladeshi are Muslim, so I've always wondered how they continued to be faithful during the Holy Month despite their punishing and gruelling working lives here in Singapore. Last night (4th July 2016) I photographed these Muslim workers saying their Terawih Prayers outside their dormitory in Tuas, where space is so limited within the dorms that they have had to bring their faith out onto the roadside.""

Children are the casualties of 'war'. I have been encountering many bitter divorce cases recently. Ex-husbands who prolong the legal disputes, wives who make 'false' complaints and husbands denied access...many variations and you can interchange the gender. It's so difficult to tell what's what. I have my sympathies at times but need to follow up to determine how best to support the individual-couple...child. Whatever is the 'truth', what I am sure about is that the children suffer. 

Please share the video and the links for those who may need it. And for us too so that we are reminded of what can happen and to try to never approach the crisis point. 

We need to work hard to make marriages work. Spend time together to strengthen our families. It needs time and effort. It needs us to give and take. It needs us to be selfless. It needs us to try and love unconditionally. Many of us will fall short of the ideal but we should not give up. It can be beautiful even if imperfect.

I also took the opportunity to catch up with some of our stall holders. I'd been discussing with NEA and partners on a fair package for everyone during the upcoming renovations and maintenance. Managed to secure a good package. So far, many are happy with the arrangements, especially the reduced time frame of about 2 months instead of 3. Will have to speak to more and gather other feedback.

Hence, we need to apply ourselves, learn, practice and keep at it. We will continue to explore how best to do this and to improve the support measures for parents.

No matter how busy work gets, I too would like to be active and present in my children's lives. I need to plan for time to be actively set aside. If we don't, there will be many other activities that will rapidly take those moments away. Where possible, we can plan for holidays together. But oftentimes, it's the simple things like picking them up from school as it gives us time to chat while enroute; having a meal together; going out for a jog etc. As parents, we make a big difference in their lives, hence they really must be our first priority. 

The time we set aside must not be 'leftover time'! üò±üòÅ
 
To all Dads out there, Happy Father‚Äôs Day! Whatever we as dads can manage, let‚Äôs try to set aside time every day to bond with our children and nurture them. Let us all be Dads for Life!

Since then, they have welcomed two new young ones to their family :) Congrats!

It's amazing where and how our paths cross and in all sorts of context. One of my first holidays after GE2011, I was in Taipei and someone came up to me and said he recognised my camera! (probably due to the images of my rail corridor walk my Nikon was with me all the time). There was once an impromptu photo shoot near a traffic light in HK. I met a couple and their daughter in Siena...I think they sent me an email but somehow I couldn't find it again to reply to...The most unusual was passing some Singaporeans while wading in the streams in Lombok. I have yet to be on a holiday where I haven't met a Singaporean! And it is always great meeting your fellow countryman when you are away!

182928775083239_1144146402294800,"Many of you would remember the Ashley Liew story. But what about coach Zhu?

Earlier today, I visited coach Zhu Xiaoping. We will be recognising her fortitude with a special award. Coach Zhu's rhythmic gymnasts won a gold medal in the group all-round team event at the SEA Games last year ‚Äì the first gold medal earned by our rhythmic gymnastics athletes in a major event. 

Coach Zhu has actually been undergoing cancer treatment since 2013 after she was diagnosed with colon cancer. She would coach whenever possible. Months before the Games, when her colleague and coach for the athletes in the group all-round event resigned abruptly, she stepped up to lead the athletes in both individual and team events to ensure that their training was not disrupted. Her dedication to the sport and the team is admirable and deserves to be commended. She shared with me that the cancer has spread further and she will be going for a new course of treatment after next week's awards. I wish her the very best!

Marathoner Ashley's story at the 28th SEA Games last year continues to inspire. Ashley found himself in the lead early in the men's event after the lead pack of runners missed a U-turn. Instead of taking advantage of their error, he slowed down and waited for them to catch up.

To him, ""achievements are secondary to characters; hardwire values prompt the necessary actions in response to any situation"". His deed of sportsmanship has earned him a special award at the Singapore Sports Awards on June 23, which his coach Mr Rameshon Murugiah will accept Ashley's behalf, as he is about to graduate from chiropractic school in the United States and is unable to attend. 

Both coach Zhu and Ashley have demonstrated values which we often overlook and take for granted. Thank you for inspiring us, for being extraordinary in ordinary circumstances and for showing us that little acts of kindness and dedication matter and can make a difference.

It is something we just have to keep reminding ourselves of. Usually we are triggered by events. Near-misses. Illness. Loss of loved ones. Events that remind us of the fleeting nature of life. And then I guess we find ways to insulate ourselves. We forget and we get swayed by the wide and easy path. Until our next reminder.

I know Mr and Mrs Ong and remember them as a very nice couple. It is a tragic incident and the Singapore Police Force are investigating. It's a huge shock to the family. And traumatic. I'm glad that Mr Ong's injuries were not too serious. Such a close call though. If the cuts were deeper, or closer to vital arteries... But it is tough on him as they were a very close couple. RIP Mrs Ong. And to the Ong family, please take care. üôè

When Mr Ong recounted the incident, I was so glad that some passerby's responded to his calls for help. I could imagine some choosing to ignore and not want to be involved. If we notice anything wrong, please don't be too shy to just check things out. At worse, it'd be a little embarrassing for us. But in some instances, like this, it definitely made a difference to Mr Ong and his family who were still in the house."
182928775083239_1139360116106762,"After visiting Mdm Sarah Tan yesterday, I popped by JEM to visit Mr Png Lye Heng, the deaf cleaner who was reprimanded publicly at a foodcourt last week, and management. He was in good spirits and gestured to me that he was no longer bothered by the incident. I also told him that I was impressed with his positive spirit, and that his act of magnanimity is something that we could all learn from. We (as in my colleague!) managed to communicate by penning questions in Chinese on a piece of paper, while he gestured with his replies. üòÑ
 
We can all still learn to treat Singaporeans with special needs and disabilities with more empathy. An attitude survey conducted by the NCSS Singapore showed that the public displayed social distances towards persons with sensory or physical impairment, as well as autism and intellectual impairment. More than one third of the public also said that they would not employ persons with disabilities if they were an employer. However, the survey also noted that with more frequent contact, the public's attitudes towards persons with disabilities could be improved. And this is why we've launched the Disability Awareness Campaign (http://seethetrueme.sg/) - hopefully, we will all learn to see persons with disabilities for who they are as individuals, and how they too can contribute to society, instead of the disability they have. 
 
To employers who hire persons with disabilities like Mr Png - a big thank you, and I sincerely hope that you would continue with your hiring practices. They have assured me they will. If you would like to consider hiring persons with disabilities but unsure of where to start, we have available resources for employers on disability employment on SG Enable's Disability Empolyment Portal for you to tap on: 
http://employment.sgenable.sg/
 
As for Mr Png, he'd told me that he has gotten some job offers after deciding to leave the current food court. I'll also be getting my colleagues to follow up with him, to see if he would need additional assistance in other areas, and if we could help. 

This is a regrettable incident but let's hope that it has also lend focus on overcoming these mindsets. And for us all to be conscious as we interact with others. 

(Btw....whether you have flu or not, or if a person is disabled or not, one shouldn't have behaved in the way the woman did. Respect our fellow workers.)

Their neighbours are involved too and we take the opportunity to remind everyone of Ramadan. It is also an opportunity for us to catch up with our residents and see how they are. One uncle who was past 80 appeared very tan. I asked him what happened. ""I've been swimming!"" He is one of the active ones who keep active and quite plugged in when he learnt to use the computer. Another shared with me that she has been feeling very tired and drained, doctors said that she was dehydrated, but she has been drinking water regularly. Would need to check up on her again. Some other issues were also raised and we need to follow up...top up of cards, aches and pain municipal matters...etc

182928775083239_1138885966154177,"Many of you would have heard about Mdm Sarah Tan of Choon Ming Bao Dian. How she has provided jobs and shelter for many unwed mothers and children.
 
When I first heard about her, I was touched by her kindness. I wanted to find out more about those whom she was helping because we would also be able to assist some of them. I dropped by her home for a chat this afternoon. Since 2004, she has provided help to about 50 people. If I had thought her kind, I am now struck by her generosity of spirit...a truly remarkable, and inspiring lady. And she is not even a citizen here but a PR from Malaysia. But it doesn't matter does it? It is really about human kindness.
 
Mdm Tan is an example of what we mean when we talk about building an inclusive society. It is about being involved, playing a part and caring for others and not just self. She told me that it‚Äôs not just about providing shelter and work ‚Äì it‚Äôs also about guiding and nurturing so that some of the individuals can find a new path and stand on their own two feet. She had not reached out to us before. I told her that she can always contact us. My SSO colleagues and I will continue to complement the good work she is doing, by coordinating support for those under Mdm Tan‚Äôs care. 

I spoke to a young single mother there. And also chatted with the kids that were there. A real adorable bunch. But you could see the loving environment Mdm Tan provided. Of course, not many of us can be like her! But everyone plays a part, big or small. If we all begin to collaborate, Govt, people, VWOs...our collective reach will be greater and the impact more significant. And as we care, we become a better people and a better society.
 
And of course, if you know of anyone who needs help, talk to them. Find out more. Link them up with the nearest Social Service Office or Family Service Centre so they can access help.
 
So, share Mdm Tan‚Äôs story. I hope it inspires you too, to get involved and help others. Collectively, we can make a big difference to those in need.

Can I urge parents to spend as much time as possible to read to their children and tell them stories? It cost you nothing but it brings so much joy and bonding. This was something I enjoyed very much when my children were younger. I remember lying down with them on the mattress on the floor and it became an imaginary space ship or sail boat. And to add to the realism, I stuck luminous stars in the ceiling above so that it glowed in the dark as we set off on our nightly adventures. 

I spent a lot of time reading when I was young. Queenstown Library was a favorite haunt. I don't think I was prolific nor very cheem in that I don't have lots of deep profound titles to bandy around. I remember children's books like the Henry Huggins series by Beverley Cleary, when older, fantasies like Tolkein's epics, or fictional novels by Kazuo Ishiguro. And loads of history of anything...especially military history. My favorite subjects in school were Literature and History. I now wished in hindsight, that I pursued that at the University. 

Less time to read these days. But I try when I can. Do comics count? I enjoy Neil Gaiman's series and am ploughing through them (now they are quite cheem!). Alan Moore's and Frank Miller's works work too. 

Leadership and management books are useful. We all need to continue to work at it and learn. And re-learn. There are a few that I've personally found useful. I am re-reading 'Leadership and Self-Deception' presently. Strongly recommend it. It is useful not only for leadership and management, but even, and perhaps especially, for personal relationships. The 'Good to Great' and 'Built to Last' books are very useful too.

FROM BEING ‚ÄòACCESSIBLE‚Äô TO BEING ‚ÄòINCLUSIVE‚Äô
 
http://m.todayonline.com/singapore/five-year-disability-awareness-campaign-launched

We are not there yet but over the last few years, Singapore has made significant progress in various areas of accessibility for the disability community. We see this in the physical environment and facilities around us. Our public transit system, such as MRT stations and trains, buses and bus interchanges are progressively more wheelchair-friendly. We are also seeing more accessible facilities such as ramps, lifts at overhead bridges, tactile tracks and visually-impaired friendly ATMs in our neighbourhoods. 

Here at the Enabling Village, there is a supermarket with wheelchair-friendly trolleys and magnifiers for persons with visual impairment. There is also a gym where deaf persons can tap into the hearing induction loop system so that they can better hear instructions from fitness instructors.  

Just two days ago, the first disability sports programme for swimming was launched at Seng Kang Sports Complex. This sports complex is one of the Centres of Expertise for disability sports under the Disability Sports Masterplan.  NCSS has also launched two inclusive playgrounds with wheelchair accessibility features‚Äì the second one just last week ‚Äì which allow children with disabilities to play alongside their peers. More inclusive playgrounds are in the pipeline and will be completed in the next few years. 

These efforts are gaining momentum. We will not let up. With the adoption of universal designs for our city, Singapore is moving closer to our vision of becoming a truly inclusive society. 

Creating common spaces is an important effort because being able to be in that some shared space is the start of us being together with our fellow Singaporeans of different abilities. 

Having accessible facilities is just one aspect of fostering an inclusive and caring society.  Beyond the physical hardware and infrastructure, what is even more important is to raise awareness within the wider community on disability issues, and to nurture the right attitudes when interacting with persons with disabilities amongst us. 

At the We Are Able! 2016 event earlier this year, the keynote speaker, Mr Huy Nguyen (pronounced as Hoi Nu-anne), who has a physical disability, shared that he was delighted to go for a swimming lesson where the pools were accessible to wheelchair users. However, he was later told that his instructor was not able to coach him with the rest of the students. The other students shared learning tips with one another but not with him, as they did not know how to engage him or felt awkward in doing so. In this instance, he had access to the facility but did not feel included because of the actions and behaviour of the people around him. Such behaviour stems from a lack of awareness and understanding, possibly due to a lack of interaction with persons with disabilities.  

This is why the campaign we‚Äôre launching today is important. The campaign signifies a concerted effort to make inclusivity part of our lives, from merely making physical infrastructure accessible to addressing people‚Äôs mindsets and attitudes towards interacting with persons with disabilities. It is indeed timely to begin to inculcate a culture of inclusiveness in our society. We could all start by taking small steps: not just by accepting but also including persons with disabilities in our community activities. We could make it a point to interact more with persons with disabilities, so that we could improve our understanding of their needs. More often than not, we are uncertain about how we should interact with persons with disabilities, because we simply do not interact with them frequent enough. I am thus glad that NCSS is taking the lead in the public education efforts to make available resources and opportunities to help members of the public learn how to interact respectfully and more confidently with persons with disabilities.

MAKING STEPS TOWARDS INCLUSION 

What makes an inclusive society?  For me, an inclusive society is one where we appreciate and accept the people around us as who they are, regardless of what they are born with or without.  It is one where we respectfully interact and engage with persons with disabilities, because they too, have something to contribute to society, in their own ways. 

It is one where our peers, family members and colleagues with disabilities will be empowered and recognised, and given the opportunity to become integral and contributing members of society ‚Äì where they can truly be themselves.

I know of instances where companies hired persons with disabilities, and the colleagues got together to help and make accommodations for their colleague with a physical disability. This allowed the persons to actively contribute their strengths in the workplace and as a result, flourish. These actions have helped shape the entire organisation‚Äôs culture to become more nurturing and cultivated camaraderie. We hope to see more of such inclusive practices in the workplace. I am also certain that the lessons learnt at the workplace will have a spill-over effect into the community at large through the people that work in this organisation.

With every changed workplace, we will begin to see that same change in society. Slowly. But surely.

As we strive towards better inclusion, the campaign we are launching today will boost efforts in enabling the public to better understand and empathise with the challenges persons with disabilities face. They may behave or act a little differently, but we must also not lose sight of their varying abilities. 
While we are sometimes quick to observe the weaknesses of persons with disabilities, we should similarly acknowledge and utilise their strengths and passion. We have to keep supporting and challenging persons with disabilities so they can maximise their potential. This is no different from developing a person of any ability.

INCLUSION AS PART OF THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT

Building an inclusive society is a national effort. It is a key strategic direction of the current Enabling Masterplan and a focus in our many public consultation sessions for the third Master Plan.  The Steering Committee that has been set up will study, analyse and recommend how we can bring social inclusion to the next level. 

For our Enabling Masterplan to work, we need to adopt an inclusive mindset and live it out in our daily lives. Underlying all these efforts and initiatives, is the motivation behind this ‚ÄòSee The True Me‚Äô Campaign. We need to change the way we view persons with disabilities ‚Äì from focusing on their disabilities to acknowledging their abilities; from seeing them as mere recipients of giving to active contributors to the society; from scrutinising what they are not to accepting them for who they are. 

Each and every one of us should and could play a part to build an inclusive society. For persons with disabilities, do not be afraid to show the true you to others. For the caregivers among us, allow your loved ones the freedom and independence to pursue their aspirations. 

And for all of us in the larger community, I urge you to look beyond the disabilities of your friends and colleagues, and see them for who they truly are. 
Thank you.

182928775083239_1133726163336824,"Technology matters. But we as parents and teachers matter more.

We must embrace technology and be comfortable with it. Many of us have lived through a fascinating transformation that continues unabated. Remember when we were children and compare then to what we have today? Now imagine what that equivalent change would be for our children's generation? Mind-boggling.

Technology will have a role in our children's education and development. They can help our children develop their creativity, interact in a group setting and learn as a team. But the application of technology must be developmentally appropriate in the preschool and beyond. Technology should complement and not substitute teachers. There must also be an important place for physical activities like arts and crafts or music and dance, to build social interaction and collaborative play.
 
At home, technology can provide a great platform for parents to engage and interact with our children. But I also know some who use it as a child-minder...when you pass your child the iPad, he or she may not 'disturb' you for the next few hours (or days)! Please don't. We need that direct parent-child time to build trust and strong bonds with them while they are young. There are also many non-tech things we need to do. Hold a book and read. Explore our many parks. Play games outdoors. It's all about balance.
 
Technology matters. But we as parents and teachers matter more. Be there in person where we can and that journey with technology will make a great deal more sense.

Exciting possibilities:

Earlier this year during the Committee of Supply, I highlighted the importance for parents to improve their parenting skills to ensure that the parent-child bond remains strong, even when the marital relationship has broken down. This is why it is important to have in place robust support for families and children caught in divorce.
 
I met four Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (DSSAs) on Wednesday to hear about their work and progress for the past year. They have a tough job of providing families with much needed support and counselling. I commend the counsellors and social workers who have dedicated themselves to this task.
 
At the same time, my Ministry is also looking at ways to bring in more effective programmes to help families stay strong, not just in times of crisis, but also through upstream evidence-based programmes such as the Positive Parenting Programme which looks at parent and child outcomes and the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Programme which aims to strengthen marriages. More details on these programmes will be shared in the months to come.

They check on the 'regulars' who sometimes have other issues and who don't want to stay in the shelters. For others, they note down details in order to follow up with various agencies. Some who need a roof over their heads, they will endeavour to bring them in and to explore other solutions for the long haul. Some have issues at home and do not want to be family. Some, like a few near my markets, aren't homeless but sleep in the void decks because they start work early in the morning when the food arrives.

When I visited some of the homeless in the shelters, some have been able to move on, work and secure their own accommodation. Some are not ready and they carry out work in the shelters to earn some income. Others have mental and health issues. Others, can't work and have no alternatives and continue to stay.

Again, there are many varied reasons. If you meet those who appear in distress, please talk to them to understand more about their circumstances. While it is difficult to ascertain if what they share is accurate or not, do let us know if there are those whom you think need help.

182928775083239_1128069373902503,"Family Violence. It's out there. But it is also amongst us. It's difficult to talk about this especially when we encounter this in our own families. But we must.

I joined about 70 community stakeholders from very diverse backgrounds last Friday to kickstart conversations on this often silent topic, and to explore how we could all play a role to prevent family violence.  So glad to see friends from outside the social service sector ‚Äì ranging from corporates, NGOs, and Sports & Arts agencies ‚Äì joining us for the first time. There were many novel ideas on how we could raise awareness on family violence and prevent its occurrence, and more importantly, how we could mobilise the community to be involved. Collaboration and partnership amongst us all is key.
 
The trend of reported family violence cases remains stable in Singapore. But we know that many cases remain unreported. Overseas research indicates that possibly 70% of all abuse cases go unreported each year! Given greater awareness and more platforms to report, it'd be fair to say that if the underlying figures increase, we should also see a corresponding increase in reported cases. A small consolation therefore is that the situation is not getting worse. But every statistic is not just a number but an individual crying for help and a family hurt. We must stop family violence.  

Family violence is often viewed as a private matter.  But it is not.  Stopping family violence requires all of us to chip in. If we know of family violence happening in our midst, it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs responsibility to do something about it: recognise the signs, and link up those who are experiencing family violence with help.
 
We should develop further, some of those ideas that came out from the session. Stopping family violence is part of our effort to build a more caring and compassionate society. 

P.S. Thanks everyone for coming...do tag yourselves! We will keep this group active if we can!

Only to be disappointed repeatedly. Back to substance abuse. Or being arrested. Not holding on to jobs we arranged. I've not seen her for awhile and I'd wondered how she was, what happened. Did she run afoul of the law again? Sometimes when I share about individuals who need to take that final step to help themselves, I think of her. I've always wondered what else we needed to do to help turn things round. It was, for me, somewhat demoralizing. 

And there she was. You could tell immediately that she was different just by the way she looked. No longer gaunt, sunken cheeks, dark eye bags. She was cheerful and radiant. She has been working for the past year plus and doing well. In fact, her 'problem' was due to her doing well and needed to appeal for some waiver to facilitate her taking a heavier responsibility! She reminded me that I'd told her before that I hoped to not have to see her again because it'd mean that she had things sorted out. 

And she has. She was positively beaming. 

When I told her how so happy and proud  I was to see her where she is now, I was surprised by the lump in my throat and the tear ducts kinda quivering. Just quivering. üòÇ

I wish her well and may she move from strength to strength! 

Where there had been perhaps some despondence before, with individuals and families where we seemed to have 'failed', she has now given me a renewed sense that we should never give up.

They are receiving assistance and have been so for quite some time now. We have multiple agencies looking out for them. 

The biggest worry I have is their living condition. My team who works on hoarding issues have sought to clear the flat perhaps 5-6 times. We have enlisted the help of HDB, Town Council, volunteers...yet each time, they bring the things back, as they have stashes elsewhere. One group of volunteers were wary as the brother didn't want the house to be cleared. We have also tried to counsel but to little avail. 

Behind every picture is a story and often, a multi-layered one which requires much effort to unravel and to help stabilize. I have families with somewhat similar situations but with different and positive outcomes. It's not always easy to solve but we need to keep plugging away. When we pass, hopefully, our vulnerable adult act at the end of the year, we may be able to intervene more directly in some cases of self neglect. But I suspect in some instances, we have little choice but to respect the individual's choice while doing what we can to minimise the impact.

182928775083239_1125080370868070,"Visited part of Block 352 in Ubi Ave 1 this evening. Met Darwin Goh a teacher who teaches art in Serangoon JC and he shared with me a beautiful sketch of his neighbourhood, the view from his flat in Ubi. That's the beauty of art and photography because it captures a scene, one that you may view and take for granted everyday, and allows you to savour it for what it is. And you begin to realise how precious it can be...even something seemingly so ordinary.

And so it is with life. Every block filled with individuals with their own stories to tell. An avid fisherman. A couple who met while teaching in the same school. A couple who studied in Southampton. A retired contractor. An active contractor. A Republic of Singapore Navy warrior. Many proud parents who may have come from humble backgrounds but with children doing well in Poly and Uni. 3-generation families. And a 8-year old boy who ran out and gave me a hug. Etc.

Thank you for sharing a part of your lives with me and for welcoming into your homes! :)"

Attended a welcome dinner for Secretary Meng Jianzhu, Member of the Political Bureau, Secretary of the Political and Legal Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, PRC and his delegation, before heading for MPS. We'd be having our 3rd Singapore-China Social Governance Forum tomorrow.  

This #MPSMondays saw a number of cases that will need detailed following up. As we chat with residents, we sometimes unearth situations that are complex. They may not have started off seeking assistance in those particular areas but it sometimes become apparent that the situation requires deeper analyses. We will usually fix an appointment to visit them and send our volunteers to follow up in detail. Seems to be a few more tonight. Some need detailed financial planning. A few will require our healthcare partners to help as we need to ensure that the individuals are going for treatment. 
And a messy complex divorce case where the husband seems intent on draining the wife of her monies via long drawn legal battles. While I'm very sympathetic to the wife's situation, there is a legal process and it's difficult for me to say for sure who is right or wrong as I don't see both sides. Will have to help facilitate possible legal support if eligible. 

As always, thanks to the many who stay back with me to help listen, record and facilitate. And also tidy up, pack, print and fax. And who will also follow up with visits in the next few days! Kumsiaz! üëè"

Squeezed in a run home on a wet drizzly evening. At night, visiting rest of our residents at Blk 329 in Ubi Ave 1. Some follow up queries to attend to and need to figure out requests for covered walkways as well as what to do with communal facilities like soccer courts.

182928775083239_1119506398092134,"In the past, I used to remember reading (if I read at all!) about these trade and business meetings, but never quite related to it. Being involved in the past few years has certainly given me a fresh perspective. I co-chaired the Singapore Liaoning Economic & Trade Council (SLETC) with Liaoning Governor Chen Qiufa this morning. This is an annual meeting to discuss how Singapore companies can partner Liaoning enterprises. 

Spearheaded by IE Singapore (International Enterprise Singapore), the council: 
- Shares market development trends and matches business partnerships between Singapore and Liaoning;
- Helps companies solve issues in the market, including commercial disputes.

The beauty of the council mechanism lies in its value of creating more opportunities for Singapore ‚Äì both SMEs and Singaporeans at large.

As Singapore‚Äôs economy restructures, companies need to transform, innovate and open new markets. By venturing overseas, the world becomes our marketplace. Companies can harness the external markets, resources and space to help us transcend inherent limitations as a small country. With this, horizons will broaden. 

I am inspired by many of our SMEs who have taken the bold step to go into lesser known places like Liaoning. Further up north in China, its climate and environment can be harsher. But this also means lower competition when compared to the more familiar places. Our pre-school players like Character Montessori, Crestar and EtonHouse have gone into the 2nd and 3rd tier cities. M.Y. Global, a goat rearing business (yes, you read that right!), has opened a farm in Huludao city to provide healthy organic lamb meat to increasingly health-conscious Chinese consumers. Another SME, Fujicon, has tied up with Liaoning enterprise Siasun to provide integrated automation solutions, scaling themselves for bigger projects in the region. We have also brought food manufacturers to explore partnerships in food production automation.

Importantly, globally-oriented Singapore companies will create jobs for Singaporeans both domestically and overseas. More jobs will also avail themselves as Chinese enterprises internationalise. For example, a colleague shared that a Singaporean she knows was hired to work in Tencent (owns WeChat), due to his experience in managing MNC clients. Singaporeans are valued as effective connectors with the rest of the world. However, to do well, Singaporeans need to be adaptable to different working environments. 

These global opportunities allow our people to develop and learn, improving our skill-sets and employability. If we are plugged in, we will be valued for our experience and perspectives. We can then stay relevant as the global economy evolves.

182928775083239_1118483031527804,"A lady came to seek some assistance. She said she didn't need to see me as she felt her issue was too minor and did not want to trouble me. I was so glad that my friend brought her forward. 

He shared with me later what he learnt from her: 

""I'm amazed at her will to live despite all that she's been through. Her son was her only family and he committed suicide...He didn't give her any closure, no reason why he took his own life suddenly. The mere mention of him would bring tears to her eyes uncontrollably. She has been suffering from depression ever since but she forced herself to work and she saw a psychiatrist to treat herself. She didn't want to burden anyone. 

With all her thoughts of death she was resilient as ever. She has great clarity in thoughts and I took the chance to encourage her to volunteer and step out to make friends. She didn't see value in herself to contribute and she's very wary of people because she has been cheated by people before in her worst times so I told her she will make a friend tonight and when she has moved to her new home and settled down and is ready for a fresh start, I will find her a good place to give back to society and be active again.

I don't think there can be a better place to recharge my soul as MPS.""

She had reluctantly come to seek assistance with the purchase of a smaller flat. But it is always so important to understand the sometimes untold stories behind every situation. She was struggling. No more income, no family and savings depleted. She was pawning off her items to raise monies. At least her home was paid up and she was looking at moving to a smaller place, and this would help her manage her own finances. And even in this state, she still insisted she didn't want to trouble us.

Will get her the assistance she needs to tide her over until she establishes a new equilibrium. We will make this happen.
