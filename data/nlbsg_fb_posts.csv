One of my favourite past-times growing up was to go to the old Marine Parade Library every weekend to borrow my full quota of books. I have less time to read non-work-related materials these days, but I still try to set aside time for this small pleasure whenever I can.

I'm now reading a book ""Frog"" by Chinese novelist and Nobel laureate for literature Mo Yan. It's hard for me to read the original version in Chinese. But this English translation published last year is very good, and captures many of the nuances of the original Mandarin text.

What books are you reading now? Any recommendations for my next book? :)

From 1565 to 1815, galleon ships routinely made Trans-Pacific roundtrip voyages, carrying American silver (mined in Mexico and Peru) to Manila.  There, the largely Hokkien traders and settlers in the Parián, Manila's Chinatown, acted as intermediaries in the trade of American silver for Chinese silk, porcelain, spices and other precious commodities from the larger Indian Ocean and Nanyang world.

Join Dr. Evelyn Hu-DeHart, a professor at the Brown University and author and editor of numerous publications, as she shares the critical role of the Parián in the establishment of the global trading system on 11 March 2016.

She's currently reading: The Girl on the Train

The Girl on the Train is a Hitchcock styled modern psychological thriller. I found it very intriguing that there are 3 female narrators in this novel and the story goes back and forth chronologically. Hence, the plot is told in all 3 different points of view which creates huge suspense as the reader slowly unravels the murder mystery . It was also quite unconventional to have an extremely unreliable person as the main character (Rachel) and the reader don’t get attached to her as much.

This footage from 1940 features a Peranakan wedding. The archivist tells us it's probably the 5th day of the wedding, because the bride is wearing baju hock chiew, a satin top and skirt embedded with gold thread. This dress would have been worn during the chia sia ceremony on the 5th day of the traditional 12-day Peranakan wedding.

There's also scenes of Peranakan and kampung life in the pre-war years.

NLB Takes a Cautious Approach in Selecting Books for Children

The National Library Board has a wide collection of books on various topics for our library visitors.  Young children are among our libraries’ most frequent visitors. Many of them browse books in our children’s sections on their own. As such, NLB takes a pro-family and cautious approach in identifying titles for our young visitors. We have a collection of more than five million books. In selecting children’s books, we sieve through the contents and exercise our best judgement. We also refer to synopses, reviews and other books written by the authors. We continually review our children's collection. Parents can be assured that NLB is sensitive to their concerns and views, and their feedback."
