Did a live interview this evening on colorectal cancer with Daniel Martin on Mediacorp 938LIVE. We talked about the signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer, and how early detection can help.

One caller spoke about how his wife had passed away from colon cancer. They have a young daughter.

It was an emotional moment in the studio. The fight against cancer isn't just professional -- it's deeply personal. Last year my own father lost his battle with cancer. And so many of us know of friends and family who have fought - or are still fighting - the battle with cancer.

Wherever we are, we can reach out to cancer patients, survivors and caregivers, so that no one walks alone. <3

內衣公司內的糾紛中間出現一場
女：男人根本不懂內衣
男上司：如果女人是使用者，那男人就是觀眾
後你必須接受新人

WHAT?!! Seriously?!!這是新傳媒給大眾傳播的訊息嗎？

小學男生去撩小女生裙底，中學男生去拉女生肩帶，不都是以這樣的心態嗎？女生就是要給男生看的啊！

老師們長輩們也會以「跟你玩」/「開玩笑」繼續這樣造就下一個受害者？再加上媒體傳播，應該嗎？

就因為「我看你是你的榮幸」？「我摸你就是抬舉你」？伸展下去的「強暴你因為你太誘人」？女人本來就是男人的玩物/所有物？

看電視不要那麼認真？就是因為你們身為媒體才更需要宣導正確的性別平等觀念！當全世界在教導女性身體的自主權時，新傳媒以父權手段來告訴所有觀眾，女人的身體還是由男人來控制的！這種倒退的資訊與行為是身為媒體可以傳送出去的嗎？

請正視！

Was watching <The gentlemen> and there's a scene in the discussion room
Female: Men have no idea in bra (or some sort like that, was listening to the conversation)
Male superior: if women are consumers, men would be the audience

Like seriously, Mediacorp, this is the message to broadcast to your audiences?? 

Boys pulling girl's skirts or bra straps and etc, saying ""women are meant to dress for men"" so they had been given the right to do so?

What happened to gender equality? Like giving the message of patriarchy to all your audiences that woman are controlled by men?

Is this your stand as a media? To the public? By going backwards in equality? This is disturbing and disappointing!"

Many car models nowadays have lit dashboards when the engine is running but some drivers forget that they still need to manually turn the lights on as not all cars come factory fitted with auto headlights.

An hourly reminder would be nice as those drivers are a hazard to other road users.

Thank you."
414646378558039_1110252468997423,"Hi there,
I'm wondering if Mediacorp will consider introducing programmes in dialect on online platforms such as Toggle. While I understand that a ban on the use of dialects is in place for television and radio, the ban does not cover online content platforms, which could be used as an effective to introduce teens to dialects, as seen by recent clips on the Channel 8 Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/MediaCorpCh8/videos/10153760249630345/)

I acknowledge that being fluent in Mandarin is encouraged and also essential, but dialects should also have their significance acknowledged, as it may help to foster greater ties to our Chinese roots.

Thank you."
414646378558039_1109653945723942,"Dear Sir, Channel U and other MediaCorp channels except those on Digital TV channels 29 and 31 were suddenly lost from yesterday night around 10pm.  Since then till now, these channels were not restored.  Such standards from the sole National TV provider is not acceptable.  This outage resulted in my ability to only receive Channel 8, 5, Suria and Vas.  Before the outage I had no problems receiving any of the channels.  I am a resident of Bukit Panjang.  I hope MediaCorp can restore the channels soonest possible because such outages erode consumer confidence on MediaCorp's ability to deliver Digital TV to every home in Singapore.  Until such time the Digital TV network is stabilised, MediaCorp should never have asked consumers to switch to Digital TV so soon."

Dear Mediacorp, I'm a huge follower of your programmes. However, I'm a little dismayed at the situation I find myself in. I live in Wessex Estate, and have done so for over 3 decades. Yet on a quiet Sunday, the mega screen you have on your building facade is not only lighting up the entire quiet neighbourhood daily and every night, it is now also blasting an unbearable amount of sound at this very moment. It's a Sunday. is there really a need to disrupt the peace that has been a hallmark of this estate for over 50 years? What you have also chosen to broadcast now is the Star Awards, the volume is unbelievably loud and what's worse is that it is all in Mandarin, not entirely sensitive to the varied race makeup in this estate. The crowd cheers inherent in your live broadcast are also very disturbing as it consists of people screaming and cheering at rather piercing levels. We can understand if there is an actual event happening at Mediacorp at One-North but this is all coming just from your mega screen and your PA speakers. It does seem a little over-indulgent given that no one is actually physically present there watching this. Yet it is intruding most unceremoniously on the one rest day we have here at Wessex. Honestly, it sounds like Orchard Road here and at the fast pace of Singapore life, we desperately need the quiet Sunday to recharge for the work week ahead. Please be a considerate neighbour and stop the immense disturbance here in this area. I implore you as a resident of this area for 35 years."

How to receive the digital TV channels – There are a few ways to switch to digital TV.

Scenario 1 - StarHub TV or Singtel TV subscription: If your TV set is connected to StarHub TV or Singtel TV services, you do not need to do anything as you are already enjoying digital TV.

Scenario 2 - Convert your existing TV with a digital set-top box and antenna: You do not need to buy a new TV set. If your TV set is not connected to StarHub or Singtel TV service, just buy a digital set-top box and an indoor UHF antenna, and connect them to your existing TV set to watch digital TV channels. If you have an existing indoor UHF antenna, you can connect it directly to the digital set-top box.

Scenario 3 - Upgrade to TV with built-in DVB-T2 digital tuner: Alternatively, you can consider buying a TV set with a built-in DVB-T2 digital tuner (Integrated Digital TV or IDTV). Just connect the IDTV to an indoor UHF antenna to watch digital TV channels.

For Scenarios 2 and 3, if you are living in a landed property with your own rooftop UHF antenna, you can connect it directly to the digital set-top box or IDTV.

According to the original owner who owns the rights to the photo time lapse clip and the photo being featured behind the newscaster, he was not approached for permission to use his intellectual property.

To substantiate his claims here are the clip and photo from his collection online.

The best part is that no checks, permission nor credit was attributed to the original owner of the works. Coming from a reputable company that won many awards, surely the basic rights in association with intellectual property law should be adhered to.

Instead, the company had not only contravene the rights of the owner not just once but three times.

414646378558039_10207127213364049,"Finally, this is the drama series I have been looking forward to for a very very long time!

Christopher Lee and Tay Ping Hui in the same show together for the first time. Though they have been featured in previous shows about Hotel and Sars, this is the first time they meet and talk to each other.

The way I see it - though some of you might disagree, of all the Channel 8 actors, they have the highest IQ and EQ. 

Not only are they tall, athletic and loved sports, they are the most intelligent due to their frequent reading habits. 

Not only they can speak and present well but they can observe, analyze things and come up with solutions very quickly when it comes to helping others.

Which I believe are the traits that most women are attracted to them.

Though there are other actors like Yu Qiwu, Pierre Png etc who are tall and muscular, in terms of intelligence not many - except the late Huang Wenyong and current Chen Shucheng - can match them."

1.  I am writing to request that Channel 5 move the 3-hour block of children’s programmes from 6am to 9am on weekdays to okto.
This would free up the above 3-hour time block for adult programmes on Channel 5.

As okto broadcasts children’s programmes during the day, it makes sense for the children’s programmes to be broadcast on okto instead of Channel 5. 
  
  

2.  When are okto, Suria, Vasantham and Channel U going to broadcast 24/7?

There are plenty of programmes available from different genres (news, current affairs, entertainment, documentaries etc) to fill up the current significant times when these channels are not transmitting programmes.

Tonight, people all over Singapore will come together with family and friends to count down to a very special year for our nation. Many will gather at Marina Bay, including 25,000 people attending MediaCorp’s Celebrate SG50 countdown show.

While we celebrate, we remember those who are grieving the loss of their loved ones on flight AirAsia #QZ8501, and those who have lost their homes in floods in Malaysia. Disasters connect not just those they directly affect, but the communities around them, and remind us how precious life is.

MediaCorp will be donating $100,000, part of the proceeds of tonight’s show, to The Singapore Red Cross, to support its efforts in protecting human life and dignity, relieving human suffering and responding to disasters.

We look on these difficult times with the knowledge that brighter days are ahead of us, and with the hope that our solidarity, collective courage and determination will help us rise to every challenge."

At a townhall on Friday afternoon, our client Singtel Consumer Singapore Yuen Kuan Moon took up the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, but not before he nominated MediaCorp CEO Shaun Seow to do the same.

Naturally, Shaun took the challenge!

The original idea behind the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge was that when nominated, you either make a donation to the ALS Association or dump ice water on your head.  Shaun opted to both donate and get soaked, dunking himself on Friday night in front of some 300 staff at our Group Sales & Marketing “Full Throttle” awards dinner.

午餐過後小弟將公佈""""""政治流氓""""""的目的~~~
注意重點:全被小弟用命釣出來了~~就在2013/08/23之後的那三週!!!
讓我用之前的文章先""""""暖場""""""!!!!
1.壟斷 2.房仲佈局
行前教育一下
台灣房子的權利分為兩種也就是說完整的買到一間房子會有以下兩種權利證明
1.建物所有權狀:內容載明房屋結構體部份的應有權利也就是""""""地上權""""的部份
這個部份有個特殊的地方要特別注意也就是待會""""不動產詐騙集團""""使用的部份
說明如下:台灣""""地上權""""是屬於""""永久居住權""""注意這""""都更時只有""優先購買權""
"""" 最專業狡猾的不動產詐騙集團都是放長線釣大魚""""所以都會預先佈局
2.土地所有權狀:載明土地所有權利的部份
接下來小弟先解說30~40年前房屋的建造流程:
1.地主有地找政府官員與建築師跟工程公司蓋屋給全家族居住使用;等建造完成後
再請""""""代書""""""辦理各項權利登記才會有所謂的""""建物所有權狀""""
所以""""地可能是全家族共有""""或之前報上登載的情形""""家族某幾人有而家族其它
成員沒有所以到時進行登記時只會有""""建物所有權"""";解析:因地主與所有居住人 
皆為同家族成員所以到時""""都更""""比較沒問題
大象叔叔今日主題:壟斷!!!破案獎金在裡面!!!請大家瘋狂轉傳!!!
""""宗教系同學""""有新增內容!!!做報告吧!!!
注意:新聞在鼓吹民眾買法拍銀拍千萬不要,因為很容易被設計!!
因為很多物件都是一而再再而三被法拍銀拍是很明顯的圈套!!
注意2:大家有沒有發現看晨間新聞時,都是拿""""""各大報""""""出來播放,也就是沒新聞因為""""""封鎖消息""""!!!
壟斷行業:""""""通訊行""""與""""""不動產經紀業""""""=通路
全面清查""""蔡家國際""""!!!P.S:絕對有問題沒問題跟大家講幹麻~~光華商場很多都同一個老闆只是""""招牌不一樣""""!!!!
陽子媽媽它們說:土狼帶隊因為他也欠我們一家!!!!因為他也會被設計成走投無路而且當年他也被設計了~~~~剩下的千萬別回來~~~
陽子媽媽它們說:你傻眼了~~~~當年都用刀,槍誰給的!!那時候我還沒出生!!!嘿~~嘿~~嘿~~又剉賽剉流了~~~陽子媽媽說我又乖又棒因為我說:報仇~~~~
參考重點:民國82~83年利用媒體製造海砂屋下跌事件--->搶店面!!!
用""""下毒""""的沒幾個人抓的出來,因為不會經過""""法醫""""而且要老法醫才可能知道~~~
注意重點:手機導入時間民國84年~~所以是""""有計劃性""""壟斷通訊通路!!!!因為有個資又可控制通訊~~當然要壟斷~~現在大家知道偽造技術多精良了吧!!!因為台灣電影業沒落~~~~癈話九把刀拍那種小品是能看喔~只是畫質比較好而已~~拍一部就好還""""等一個人咖啡""""勒~因為""""那一年一起追的女孩""""我連看都不想看,而且是在電影台才發現有這部~馬上轉掉~雙瞳劇情還不錯~詭絲就..................
注意調查重點:幕後金主,店東家族(姻親的姻親),遊民人頭等~~~
注意重點:店面在早期一定是""""地主的"""",店面我租人就好幹麻賣,所以根本不會有人賣店面什麼時候才有店面在市場流動勒~~我猜是民國83年開始~~~
注意調查重點2:調查的所有集合一定會Focus在某一群""""現在的高官權貴富二代三代上""""""因為經過30幾年全被我們一家三代調出來了~~馬氏家族全釣出來了~~請看電影""""馬少林系列""""!!馬鶴凌也有辦報紙喔!!!我怎麼知道的?當然是陽子媽媽它們跟岳父大人們跟我講的!!現世報躲不掉,認命吧~~~~最簡單的方法""""達欣工程,德春營造,欣達的股東名冊""""!!!
注意重點:1993年民國82年，连战出任行政院院长，马英九受邀出任中华民国法务部部长，当时马认为自己与司法界没有任何渊源，连战表示这就是起用马英九的理由。[19]李马关系因总统直选意见分歧后逐渐变调，马宣称将严办地方黑金势力而受到瞩目，但在三年后被撤换，舆论猜测是因为查贿肃贪差点铲掉国民党基业，李登辉私下斥马用批评党来建立个人声望，“国民党差点被他搞垮。”[20]连战续任行政院长后，马英九转任为政务委员。
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
看完以上有看到脈絡了嗎???幫大家整理一下!!!!
目的:刷不動產想變為地主因為每間房屋都有""""""土地""""""持分且是高官權貴政府內部人知道未來有""""""都更""""""因為當時在制定""""公寓大廈管理條例"""";根本不用再立""""""都市更新管理條例"""";因為民國82年時發現有問題了,所以緊急停擺""""""釣主謀""""""!!!連馬家族認命吧!!!報應來了!!!現世報!!!!
結論:三黃一劉只是下線且民國80年以前就已進行計劃設計(美國協助)
步驟如下:
Step 1.利用媒體製造""""""恐慌性下跌""""""因為當時""""營造商及工程行""""
是地主(民國82年)
結果:資金週轉不靈跑路與跳樓,土地店面 被""""特定人收走""""
Step 2.壟斷通訊通路:因為有個資又可控制通訊且地政事務所有自己人 可進行""""""熱區""""""規劃,經過20幾年後全洗成自己人了~~~
Step 3.因為控制通訊且有""""個資""""可利用""""房仲""""追蹤""""特定區域""""""
Step 4.依照我的實際經驗進行""""設計構陷""""詳情請見本人上月的大作;大家見識到偽造技術了吧!! 因為都是""""內部人""""根本就是真的!!!因為都是""""高官權貴""""上法院穩贏!!
注意重點:都是""""民事庭""""時間長,受害人都已是""""遊民或自殺,被殺""""
注意重點2:漸凍人個案與所有家族背景
注：《完全自殺手冊》鶴見済(筆名肯定不是日本人)1993(民國82年)年7月4日 有害圖書名單並限制販售
新聞局局長:张京育（1984年9月─1987年4月）新聞局副局長????
藥物、上吊、跳樓、割腕與刎頸、撞車、瓦斯中毒（煤氣中毒）、觸電、投水（投河、投海）、自焚、凍死及其他自殺方法如餓死、被動物咬死或以其他物理形式致死方法。
結論:三黃一劉只是下線且民國80年以前就已進行計劃設計(美國協助)

─────────────────────────────────────── 
30年前大安或信義買了房子三十年後的今天值5000萬~ 上億 結果在賣地瓜 = =
把房子賣掉都可以買跑車了月月出國或做各種投資竟然賣地瓜= =]
因為利用法律漏洞壟斷不動產經紀業;也就是大家看到到處一堆房仲!!!
造成的結果:市值值5000可是你連2500都不見得賣得到!!!因為只有到最後""""缺錢""""時才會變賣這是人性!!!所以老伯伯一定賣地瓜!!!
只要""""""拖""""""就好反正""""""通路跟通訊""""""都我的任憑我怎麼玩;要用""""""毒""""""與""""""詐騙""""""也可;請看之前舊作設計法~~~~
陽子媽媽它們說:還大家的命來,錢下輩子再還~~~~~~
注意重點1:數據有問題沒說怎麼算!!!香港買房絕對比台灣難!!!
注意重點2:香港房屋買不到""""土地""""只有90年居住權(沒記錯的話)
注意重點3:那些專家只教人""""""買新成屋與預售屋""""""
注意最重要的重點:""""正常情況""""下台灣買房很簡單只要""""工作穩定""""但是你絕對買不到~~~因為實際上""""不是正常情況""""
注意時間點:民國82~83年利用媒體製造海砂屋下跌事件!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
主題:破解不動產房仲業佈店策略
看完你就會完全知道什麼叫""""連前總統都被玩法律的婊誰想當老闆""""了!!!!還有選出來的大部份是癈物!!!!
重點:圖表Y軸代表漲跌幅
重點1:掛招店=加盟但都掛著同樣的招牌讓你分不出那間是加盟店跟直營店;就算招牌有意無意標錯字也沒人知道!!!名片也可!!!反正不犯什麼法!!!!
重點2:看地圖不過相信很多人看不懂-->也就是看""""區域密集度""""
""""重點3房屋特性"""":易維修,""""""再購置週期長"""""",保值,""""資金可靈活運用(看過窮爸富爸就知道了)"""",耐用年限,金額大轉手週期長
重點4:若要進行""""都更""""一定是""""""台北市最先施行""""""所以最有價值;因為""""住宅密集度""""與""""人口密集度""""還有""""工作數量""""都是台北市及少數台北縣某幾區
故我只以台北市為例
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
我這樣開頭好了!!!!
若""""一對夫妻""""想買房由於""""""路邊小廣告太危險很容易被騙""""""而且考慮重點在於
""""""工作地點與生活機能"""""";而且為了存""""頭期款""""工作與生活時間被壓縮,自然沒時間去研究區域!!所以當然是去找房仲啦!!!
投資房產最快的小袐訣只要一個下午就可以完成:
需要工具如下:一本地圖與一支筆還有腳以及一瓶飲炓,跟一個下午的時間即可完成一區!!!而你只需做幾個動作那就是""""""房仲店面所在地在地圖上畫一點"""""",等當區調查完畢後,八成會有很密集的地區將此區畫個大圈,等到整區調查完畢後;把大圈連連看那就是所謂的""""""熱區""""""也就是""""精華""""
看到以上""""""一堆房仲店家馬上要收起來了!!!!""""""這應該也算""NLP""的一種吧!!!!
別急越到後頭內容越勁爆!!!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
重點來了一般民眾""""""絕對買不到""""""!!!!!!為什麼呢!!!!看圖一超勁爆的內幕準備來了""""""為何公寓大廈管理條例不一次修完""""原因1;條例法律位階低容易被修改只是部份小原因!!!!
接下來請把靈杵後面的圖全拿出來比較(最好列印出來看);看解說就知道為什麼會3年後馬上又來個""""""無效力的都市更新條例""""""了!!!!!
剖析:先講結論利用""""""權力進行財富洗牌""""""把原本的""""國土規劃""""給毀了一大半!!!!!!
我就用""""時間""""來做個""""橫向分析""""吧!!!!
請先找""""可以癈掉的都市更新條例圖""""的下""""兩張房屋價格趨勢圖""""與""""薪資圖""""
P.S:兩張趨勢圖比較下有玄機喔!!!!!大家找到了嗎???
我們先來回想一下民國70年左右的各位在忙些什麼;因為十大建設與房屋貸款制度的成形大家忙於工作,適逄台灣經濟起飛薪資加速成長;所以房價快速成長且房貸也很快速的清償完畢;然後大家開始""""買第二間""""!!!看第一張價格趨勢圖表""""共有兩個下跌段""""(一)民國77~79 (二)""""民國83年""""
超勁爆內容來了請注意""""民國83年與那則新聞內容和那兩張維基解密的金融風爆時間""""
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
解說前先做個行前教育再對照所有的圖才會看的懂(高中大學以上):
""""重點3房屋特性"""":易維修,""""""再購置週期長"""""",保值,""""資金可靈活運用(看過窮爸富爸就知道了)"""",耐用年限,""""""金額大轉手週期長所以價格不易被操控""""""
接下來我們先看:兩個下跌段(一)民國77~79 (二)民國83年
請比較:
假設:有集團在民國83年以單一事件運用新聞媒體造成""""恐慌性下跌""""
(一) 跌勢""斜率(斜度)""和""期間""---------->論點一
(二) 新聞:內容第二段開頭""""""民國83年海砂屋事件爆發(本文章公佈舊新聞一定都找不到)""""""連""""新聞局的存檔""""都不見的話那就是現任官員有問題----->論點二
(三)請看由維基解密排出的""""""金融危機年份""""""--------->論點三
(四)時間背景:當時無實價登錄;價格不透明易被掮客操控(用騙的)利用資訊不對稱--------->論點四
(五)當時的高等教育普及率;當時房屋擁有者年齡多為30~50(指民國83年)
--->論點五(現多為""""退休年齡"""")
(六)有看我先前文章就知道""""都更條例的大陷井""""------>論點六
因為提案立法修法的(多由法律相關系所引導;例:政治系是由法律系細分出來的)怎麼可能不知道這一點差別!!!!!
(七)海砂屋經由專業鑑定下經由簡易維修期使用年限也可維持在40年以上
------------------------>論點七
(八)1997(民國86年)亞洲金融風暴發生房價持續穩定;很明顯有人操控價格且表示吃貨完畢----->論點八
(九)由論點八得出:""""房貸利率持續下滑代表還款能力持續提升""""所以若無""""大規模失業潮""""房價理應穩定或""""隨物價持續上漲""""推論得知""""無大規模失業潮即無房屋拋售潮""""----------->論點九
(十)投資學裡投資客有一功用""""""價格的創造與發現""""""-------->論點十
(十一)房屋與股票不同;單一物件""""轉手週期長""""且""""交易金額大""""所以換手不易且房屋數量比股票少很多""""只要投資客手上持有數量夠多價格很容易受操控因為台灣經濟特性""""淺碟子經濟""""只要""""""善用家族成員當人頭作價""""""!!------>論點十一
(十二)若以民國77~79年的下跌段,對照""""維基解密""""""的金融危機時間可發現;剛好是美國股災所造成的儲蓄與貸款危機,在這兩年間下跌幅度只有個位數的百分比因為年份相近拿來當""""對照組""""--------->論點十二
(十三)""""民國92年""""的重大事件SARS對房價的影嚮 結論:看圖就知道""""""逆勢上揚""""""--->論點十三
(十四)在以時空背景做分析:民國67年因為中美斷交台灣經濟出現劇烈波動一堆製造業老闆因公司倒閉為了躲債務""""跑路""""至美國;並由""維基解密""得知作者於1985年發明「現金流遊戲」(CASHFLOW GAME)終於面世。為更易向大眾介紹該遊戲概念，他開始執筆撰寫""""富爸爸·窮爸爸"""";也就是民國74年就有部份台灣人知道如何靈活運用資金絕大部份是當時的留學生----------->論點十四
(十五)民國60年至75年參與房地產的投資人數不多所以房價無太大波動------->論點十五
(十六)只要公佈""""三黃一劉家族包含姻親的姻親""""在住商混合區的不動產物件總量及出租量和租金就可知道是否""""惡意操縱租金""""注意超級重點:店面與一般房屋分開---->論點(十七)""""1991年波斯灣戰爭=民國80年""""""看圖:房價小波段起漲點
(十八)一樓店面民國83年前根本就是地主的應該都沒有負債與財務問題才對!!!!
怎麼可能快速轉手!!!!!
所以店面轉手只有一個唯一可能""""""被構陷設計""""""也就是利用""""監控""
控制通訊也就是當時的""""""室內電話""""""!!!因為""""""收租金也能賺錢""""""!!!!
最簡單的方法也就是""""故意介紹人生意或投資""""然後在""""阻斷人生意""""""
或者本來就有""""生意的""""就利用上述手法""""截斷生意""""!!!!------->論點十八!!!
重點""""""""弄權""""""""也就是利用""""權利""""!!!!!
補充:刑法特點""""沒有法律追溯期""""!!!!
刑法有""""""構陷罪""""""-------->自己翻六法全書
由以上論點所導出的結論如下:
我們先來看民國77~79年的下跌段,對照""""維基解密""""""的金融危機時間可發現;剛好是美國股災所造成的儲蓄與貸款危機,在這兩年間下跌幅度只有個位數的百分比
民國83年時值""""""公寓大廈管理條例修法期""""""且時值重要的""""都更相關條款審議期""""""因""""有心集團想利用海砂屋單一事件曝光做為威脅條件將部份條文做修改,如:獎勵容積率的多寡,原址分配或抽籤分配,還有同意執行條件(讚成人數或土地持份數);而""""聰明的立法官員們知道就算同意此威脅此單一事件還是會曝光因為會提出威脅的一定是當時的""""營造專業人士""""因為是""""專業法律條文""""所以審查委員幾乎都是專業人士;知道就算是""""""海砂屋耐用年限也一定可以到都更年限""""""而且也知道此一集團一定會利用此一單一事件""""""運用媒體進行恐慌性下跌""""""所以公寓大廈管理條例僅著重在維修部份而""""都更部份""""僅點到為止留伏筆即停止修法因為還要很久不用急於一時!!!
重點來了!!!為何一定要""""製造恐慌性下跌呢""""???
原因不只是單純的快速低價進貨而已!!!!
行前教育一下:
(一)對當時的建設公司及地主們此一法案根本沒有差別,反而可以減輕建設公司的負擔(因為要養員工)也就是旗下的營造廠及合作的工程公司!!!
(二)重點中的重點:審議委員會解散後""""委員要全部改選且不得重複""""!!!!!(當時)
(三)將民國""""82年高點與低點""""相連進行時間切割明顯有人已先行""""倒貨準備低接"""";然後再看低點之後""""""價格一直很穩定""""""也就是持續慢慢偷偷吃貨
(四)再看新聞內容第一段""""士林區天母芝玉路二段""""若再進一步對買賣與成交區域進行分析應該都是集中在""""""特定區域""""""包括""""土地""""在內
(五)民國87年公佈都市更新條例
綜觀以上五點帶頭的一定是熟知法律制定流程者所精心策劃首要重點在於""奪權""也就是""""""立法權與審查權=制定遊戲規則的權利""""""所以計劃的第一步一定就是要設法把""""審議委員會解散""""才能進行""""改選奪權""""但這只是開端;重點在於""""""如何安插自己人進審議委員會""""""也就是""""""當時誰有權對審議委員進行評選""""""所以只要掌握情報系統就很好設計人所以最容易出問題的就是軍方與民間接軌那層因為都想""""致富""""只要利用資訊不對稱與情報系統的特性用簡單幾句話就能達成目的!!!! 綜觀以上五點帶頭的一定是熟知法律制定流程者所精心策劃首要重點在於""奪權""也就是""""""立法權與審查權=制定遊戲規則的權利""""""所以計劃的第一步一定就是要設法把""""審議委員會解散""""才能進行""""改選奪權""""但這只是開端;重點在於""""""如何安插自己人進審議委員會""""""也就是""""""當時誰有權對審議委員進行評選""""""所以只要掌握情報系統就很好設計人;所以最容易出問題的就是軍方與民間接軌那層因為都想""""致富""""只要利用資訊不對稱與情報系統的特性用簡單幾句話就能達成目的;所以在計劃開始執行時就知道一定會成功!!!!!(政治謀殺)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
接下來我們來看""""民國89年""""那個有10%的下跌段
我們來回顧一下那時發生什麼大事:2000年總統大選319槍擊案
結果一樣""""民國88年時就有人提前倒貨""""很明顯同一集團所為;所以只要查""""當時有那一群人利用房地產快速致富就可得知;注意重點:尤其是在民國83年之平穩期時快速擁有店面之家族!!!!嫌疑最大尤其有特殊身份的!!因為怎麼說都有理由!!!
注意重點:間碟都是雙面或三面或多面;""""""絕對沒有單面間碟因為換不到情報""""而且要""""推卸責任""""時都有理由也都有辦法推給下面的!!!!!
結合以上兩段結論:故意放火趁火打劫
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
接下來我們來看""""民國92年""""的重大事件SARS對房價的影嚮
結論:看圖就知道""""""逆勢上揚""""""
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
另一個比較重點""""""房屋租金""""

由圖表可看出民國74~79年這段時期租金價格相對穩定""""超級重點:數據是全台灣的"""";若單一以台北市計算應該會""爆表""因為其它區域對平均數據有""""""稀釋效果"""""";現在大家回想一下開頭的""""重點三""""與""""民國83年""""再比較""""平均薪資所得""""還有""""論點十四""""即可得知""""有固定一群專業投資客兼海蟑螂集團""""在海砂屋房價爆跌那段時間""""狂買店面""""再利用""""租金收入""""轉向大幅購買具有""""都更利益的中古屋""""因為""""國土規劃""""早己成形所以絕對優先購買""""""住商混合區""""""因為那是公開資訊!!!!!(也就是地目是商三的區域)
分析:""""""""如何讓你存不到頭期款""""""""跟""""""""讓你開店賺不到錢""""""""""
由圖表可知:薪資不但沒有增加其""""""實資工資""""""還下滑;然後對照第一張圖右上
注意重點:數據是全台灣而且""""""店面與住家租金""""合在一起算;也就是說拆解開來""""""更跨張""""""在單獨把台北市抽出來看""""""""一定更加跨張""""""!!!!!
目的在""""""""財富大洗牌""""""""也就是故意製造利用""""海砂屋新聞""""製造民國83年的恐慌性下跌""""""那又跟""""""頭期款""""""開店不賺錢""""""有什麼關係勒!!!
STEP1.先選定""""""目標""""""也就是某些店面的重點人物下手,例:有什麼姻親或相同社交圈關係;所以這個是需要最長時間的佈局與對""""""人""""""生活習慣的觀察
STEP2.如何制造讓不動產恐慌性下跌的消息勒!!!!
唯一方法只有'""""""建築材料""""""下手所以才會有海砂屋的新聞出來;
又要怎樣知道那棟一定有問題勒!!!!
重點:(1)設計時一定在""""""下跌前""""""而且當時房地產正熱;建案應接不暇;
所以""""建築材料""""非常吃緊;
(2)業界一定都知道用""""海砂""""的耐用年限跟有""""都市更新計劃""""
看""""計劃名字就知道了""""故名思意就是""""""都市老了要更新再造"""""" 
(3)當時""""媒體還沒有現在自由""""所以有權利利用媒體的人屈指可數查
一下就知道了!!!!
(4)""""當時""""知道有都市更新計劃的人一定都是""""特定人士""""且社會階層
比現在還""""封閉""""
(5)""""奪權又可奪財何樂不為""""又可趁機""""解決政敵""""當然會精心策劃,而
且有權又有頭腦如此精心策劃現在八成是""""政府高官""""或""""名流富紳""""; 
(6)在當時就相當有權力了;所以要找特定的營造業者配合易如反掌,因為
可用""""公共工程做為交換條件""""讓公司蒸蒸日上;而且當時正值經濟起飛
話雖如此依然是有""""窮苦人家願意頂罪換後代平步青雲;但真的有說到
做到嗎???看手段如此殘爆惡劣當然是不可能
(7)當時能與""""情治單位""""有聯係的應該沒幾位
(8)但當時""""空頭公司""""就很多了;時至今日當然死無對證啦!!!!因為主謀
當時早已算到
(9)現在要查當時的報紙資料一定早就先行被湮滅掉了;因為看我就知道
在現在能這樣設計就沒幾人了!!!何況當時....當時更封閉喔!!!
STEP3.看前文可知已有人提前為籌措資金先行出售房產準備低接,
代表對各目標所精心設計的計劃已安排妥當!!包含:人,事,物
STEP4.消息放出執行計劃
STEP5.先搶店面然後再利用窮爸富爸理論進行""""資產累積"""";在當時能有這種
知識的人絕對是留學歸國的而且沒幾人;按時間推算年齡應為35~40歲
左右!!!!-------->現在約為55~60的 """"權貴高官富紳""""
結論:都能設計那麼縝密的計劃;設計""""""大家的荷包""""""當然易如反掌;因為都
是在""""同一區同一群人""""所以只要聯合設計""""租金""""就好了;
設計目標:""""讓人沒有頭期款""""和""""店家只能賺到生活開支""""利用租金就好
誰不會啊!!!!重點在""""""量""""""
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
本篇主題重點:房仲佈局策略與增加持有量
接續上述:已知前提""""""集團已將精華區特定店面鎖碼(籌碼鎖住)""""""
進行下一步:籌碼吸收
最聰明的方法:利用""""""開不動產仲介業""""""
目的:(1)增加個人在地曝光率也就是經營在地關係(2)手上物件去蕪存菁
(3)反正都那麼惡劣了當然就上下齊手啦!!!(4)搜集屋主資訊(5)方便週轉
(6)吸收第一手消息
解析:因為可以同時接觸到""""買賣雙方"""";能最快接觸到""""自住屋主的物件""""因為房屋會變賣的原因通常只有一種""""""變現""""也就是缺錢啦!!!!!房仲講什麼屋主工作因素那些都麻不是理由!!!!這個原因外的都是特例!!!所以這樣就可以很容易增加持有量,因為有""""""其它店面租金當金源""""""!!!!等到吸收到一定量後開始去蕪存菁!!!也就是當初佈局時就已經知道""""熱區""""在那;所以怎麼做大家都知道,重點在於後面近期的行銷手法!!!!!!
注意:經過20年反覆來回操作該吸收的籌碼已趨穩定;
近期應準備進入最後吸收階段,因為時間算算差不多;20年來""""熱區內""""
有房貸該被刷去台北縣桃園的也都差不多了;
因為有不動產營業員執照(比較不會被問東問西,不然熟地政事務所的
例如約僱人員啊什麼的給個地址都麻可以請領""""第二類地籍謄本"""");
然後用第二類地籍謄本看一下有沒有附註事項就知道有沒有貸款!!!!
重要的本文來了!!!
不知道大家去調查過房仲店家分佈位置了沒有;有沒有發現一個特點,
某一區域房仲店數特別多三~四家只是招牌不一樣;癈話都同一個老闆開的,
你在附近隨便走近那一間還不是落在我手裡!!嘿嘿嘿!!!!!只要在""""熱區""""的
角落都一樣!!!嘿嘿嘿!!!!你行你就自己賣!!!""""靠房仲賣房子""""只要在熱區內的
都是我的!!!!!嘿嘿嘿!!!!你就知道這個佈局多厲害了吧!!!!
結論:都是落在我家族裡,姻親,姻親的姻親,親朋好友全都有;不然就是當人頭!!
!!看你怎麼查!!!惡劣的拿遊民當人頭!!!!!!
手法如下:
預防犯罪人人有責!!!!破案獎金在裡面!!!!!請大家瘋狂轉傳!!!!部份內容趕快備份轉傳!!!
破案唯一方法-------->""""""""個案累積+交差比對""""""""相當難破!!!!!因為還有漏洞!!!!!
行前教育:
熱區------------------------->活動範圍(刑事警察才會的知識)
(換句話說)
所需知識: 心理學,NLP,人類行為學,餐飲書籍,法律常識(詐欺刑則低,惡意騙人不犯法就說是整人遊戲)專業的就變成善意謊言,化學知識,裝潢知識,一點障眼法知識,
利用指甲縫的知識(針對有房家庭單點突破證據全下肚就算....也抓不到)
所需工具:買得到毒品的管道;還有化工行
相信大家有看到昨天與今天小弟PO的文章就知道""""民國83年""""具""""高價值都更利益商三地目區""""""的店面已落入""""同一家族(要查祖宗八代)""""手裡;
""""一定是集團式犯案""""
佈局一:利用手中店面賣""""便宜餐點""""因為""""不用店面租金""""價格可壓點;因為一定全買在""""熱區邊界或熱區內""""
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
以上成功機率八成以上!!接下來只要選""""目標""""
>(表示大於即優於)
目標首選:
家庭成員數:""""2人""""且有""""""房貸.相同社交圈"""" >家庭成員數""""2人""""且有""""房貸""""
>""""單親""""家庭小孩小有房貸(利用""""絕望""""心理)用""監控""就可以
剖析:目標找1人容易被懷疑;目標3人或以上不易成功除非是""""單親家庭""""小孩小
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
方式有好幾種就""""親身經歷""""說明:
我的有""""利用媒體""""+""""專業毒殺""""算超特殊案例;所以可以""""拆解一般案例""""
(一)使用毒品類型:易怒,爆燥型 或戒斷症狀易爆燥 目的:製造兇殺案
成員職業別:(1)只要有""不動產營業員執照""---->查""""電子謄本請領資料""""
(2)分散到熱區附近的餐飲業員工也可以---->因為久久一次!!!
(因為都是大金額,再犯案週期長,而且目標要飾篩選)
被害人結果有兩種:受害人是房仲--------->30年以上刑期
受害人是直系血親--------------->唯一死刑
實際案例:初秋華案
方法解析一:
(一)因""""金錢""""因素需賣房週轉一定比較煩燥---->當事人或外人連法官認知皆同
(二)因餐飲人口流動率快且已鎖定區域又有店面可以進行人脈擴展因都小吃業
所以很容易安插自己人去小吃攤工作
NLP語言如下:我兒子女兒最近剛失業去你那打個工賺個吃飯錢好嗎?
(因為熟識又是房東不好意思推托)
所以還有另一種:叫里長介紹(選民服務當然說好)
(三)下藥方式及方法:
(1)對兩個都下易怒型------->兩人相殺(沒房仲時
(2)只對單一人下易怒型-------->以為被下毒殺對方(可能房仲,可能家人)
配合時機點:控制電話利用轉接等方式讓房子一段時間沒賣掉
相同社交圈某人使用的NLP如下:
因為被下藥所以身體不適也就是利用戒斷反應出現時因為是下藥集團所以時間可以算很準;然後適時補上你家房子賣很久會不會因為缺錢所以想領保險金??不好意思我亂猜(亂講;或說那可能有這種事啊!!!);當然是笑笑半開玩笑的說,而且要單獨相處時;所以""""藥頭級""""的最有可能;因為""""財力熊厚""""又可""""供毒品""""!!!
因為是""""""集團犯案""""""又可叫人""""""便宜賣""""""然後一直下藥;又可在水塔下藥因為有裝潢知識可自行開鎖!!!
案例:輔仁大學女學生命案""""家在新莊對半賣;賣完馬上漲起來!!!""""
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
方法解析二:
下藥或毒品類型:易沮喪藥或戒斷症狀易沮喪 
另外方法:催眠術-------->""""""""""""六法全書裡面有自己去翻""""""""""""""
目的:讓被害人自殺
房屋形態:大廈型
過程同""""""方法解析一的(一)(二)""""""
(三)重點:社交圈型熊""""""宗教"""""" 例:日月明功
(1)先對一人下迷幻藥(令被害人產生幻覺利用行車記錄器)
(2)把""""影像拿給另一人看""""然後NLP語言如下:你家遭報應才會諸事不順;
要不要改運;不然就是""""你家前世罪孽深重要不要都來道場修行""""
短評:""""""都變成現世報了!!!只要順著走就好了!!!!""""""
(3)然後就會有""""固定到道場的週期""""然後就很方便下藥啦!!!!!
還記得我很久以前介紹過的毒品3型態:液.氣.固
(4)當然前提是""""房子要賣""""!!在道場一陣子後的NLP語言如下:你們罪孽深重冤親債主每天都跟著你們,我去你家施個法!!!!!(新型無線監視器或監聽器)專業的知道該放那!!!
(5)然後就會慢慢越來越沮喪因藥物作遂然後再加下迷幻藥!!!!
(6)久了自然會去自殺!!!!!!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
方法解析三
目的:讓被害人自殺
房屋形態:大廈型
下藥或毒品類型:易沮喪藥或戒斷症狀易沮喪 
過程同""""""方法解析一的(一)(二)""""""
因被害人在賣屋故可得知""""經濟狀況出問題""""所以只要控制被害人家裡電話包括手機;就可達成兩項目的:(1)逼被害人便宜出售 (2)讓被害人經濟狀況更為惡化 (3)合理化被自殺因素------->例久了厭世或利用之前請大家交去警局的""""""完全自殺手冊""""""""""""""""""
有無看到重點""""""""合理化自殺的理由""""""""這就是利用""""""心理學""""""而且轉手越快的房子越不容易被發覺因為""""搬進搬出""""跟鄰居不熟""""警察""""就可能會從鄰居口裡得到
""""""深入簡出""""這個答案;所以更易讓人以為是""""""自殺而其實是被自殺""""""
《完全自殺手冊》（日文名稱：《完全自殺マニュアル》）由鶴見濟（鶴見済）於1993年7月7日出版。
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
讓我們回顧:""""""論點十八""""""記得搭配""""""熱區觀念""""""
史上最大的""""辦案陷井公開""""""
利用""""""先入為主的關念""""""
《完全自殺手冊》（日文名稱：《完全自殺マニュアル》）由鶴見濟（鶴見済）於1993年7月7日出版。------>民國82年7月7日
加上當時:電視媒體大幅報導;可能將當時的""""辦案人員""""導入:
""""被害人是自殺的陷井"""";因為此書當時很""""轟動""""連當時的刑警一定都有買來研究
而這個陷井就是:""""""被害人因財務問題學完全自殺手冊的手法自殺""""""
但其實是""""他殺""""
作者是筆名所以絕對不會是日本人;因為發行前就知道一定是""""禁書""""""而且只在
日.港.台出版;而寫書人也有可能被騙,只要主謀對""寫書人""說:麻煩你為警局編寫一本關於謀殺手法的教材以做為警局內特殊單位授課用;類似這類的""""""話術""""""就能達成目的
假設有""""""軍事目的:那這本書就是某些特定人事的教戰手冊與準備信號""""""""
""""""""""""""當時還有""""""波斯灣戰爭可以利用來當煙霧彈=一石二鳥""""""""""""""
搭配我的論點(18)就可進行""""""店面搶奪""""""
(十八)一樓店面民國83年前根本就是地主的應該都沒有負債與財務問題才對!!!!
怎麼可能快速轉手!!!!!
所以店面轉手只有一個唯一可能""""""被構陷設計""""""也就是利用""""監控""
控制通訊也就是當時的""""""室內電話""""""!!!因為""""""收租金也能賺錢""""""!!!!
最簡單的方法也就是""""故意介紹人生意或投資""""然後在""""阻斷人生意""""""
或者本來就有""""生意的""""就利用上述手法""""截斷生意""""!!!!------->論點十八!!!
重點""""""""弄權""""""""也就是利用""""權利""""!!!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
新增內容""""""如何截斷生意""""""
請大家瘋狂轉傳!!!!!實用內容讓想進房仲業的青年才俊都怯步!!!!!

結論:都是落在我家族裡,姻親,姻親的姻親,親朋好友全都有;不然就是當人頭!!
!!看你怎麼查!!!惡劣的拿遊民當人頭!!!!!!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
利用""""""熱區""""""鎖定""""""目標區域""""""
利用開""""""不動產仲介業""""""就可以方便接觸""""買方""""與""""賣方""""
注意重點:台北市絕對是要接觸""""""賣方""""""而不是買方!!!!
因為""""""都市更新""""""一定從""""""台北市啟動"""""";而買方則是""""去蕪存菁""""的買主
也就是好的物件自己收起來,把沒價值的丟出去!!!
接下來我們來研究""""房仲店面的裝潢可是有學問的喔!!!!!""""""""
分析一:
我們先看店面門口的佈置,一定是一堆託售物件;重點來了真的一定都是屋主委託要賣的嗎??還有一定都是要賣的嗎???大家看得懂這兩句的差別嗎??
我們先第一個問題:通常都是要過房仲一手不然沒後台的房仲生存不下去,怎麼說勒!!!因為好物件老闆收走,仲介幾乎都賣差的物件,當然難賣賺不到錢!!!!因為大家選屋子的眼光都一樣---->買房子是一輩子的事買方當然會勤作功課所以眼光一致!!!
當然買不到好的!!!!!
請看房仲薪資分析:薪資制度分""""普專""""""""高專""""""兩種
普專---->有底薪約$22000 業績獎金約仲介費的40%
高專---->無底薪 薪資為仲介費的80%
還有拆帳方式------->也就是一個""""專接委託案""""一個""""""CLOSE就是專門銷售""""
到時在平分最後小弟會介紹分法,業界也有人都做那就不用跟人拆帳!!!!
接下來我們來看""""仲介費""""雖然合約上都寫""""賣方4%""""買方1%""""但為了方便銷售
通常在搓合時為了成交可能會變成""""""賣方2~1%""""""然後又被買方凹變成""""0%""""
注意:有看過OPEN DATE的就知道單一地區如北投區這樣算一個地區
每月""""實際移轉數""十件左右;仲介都賣自住客因為老闆是""""投資客""""
所以大家用地址簡易查詢都都是用""""讓渡書""""之類的啦!!!所以不準!!!!
那我們以買賣雙方平均仲介費2%房屋成交價1500萬本月成交一間(有些地區很難)來試算一下""""房仲薪資""""如下:
普專------>1500*2%=30(萬) 30*40%=12(萬)----->有時好幾個月才成交一間因為都不是好物件都不好賣,所以可能三個月或更久我們以運氣好三個月一間計(好區域)!!!
月薪約40000+22000=62000------->這是不拆帳運氣好的情況
普專拆帳------>12/2=6(萬) 20000+22000=42000
重點為了成交還會有些有的沒的開支如油錢等等.............
高專---------->15000*2%=30(萬) 30*80%=24(萬) 24/3=8(萬)
高專拆帳----------->24/2=12(萬) 12/3=4(萬)
所以沒""""後台背景""""的都會想辦法過一手因為不知道下間房子要多久才會賣出去!!!!
以上第一個問題解答完畢!!!!
來看第二個問題:一定都是要賣的嗎????
明天可以去一下房仲店面外面看一下!!!!
露地玻璃上都會貼滿一整面的託售物件也都排例整齊;請問大家第一眼看過去的那排大約離地面高度165公分~175公分左右那一排絕大部份都是""""好物件""""目的為了吸引目光重點是買的到嗎??聰明的老闆中間一定夾""""一兩間不好的""""那才是要賣的!!!還有最下面也是要賣的!!!然後手上一堆好物件一定不會貼出來!!!!!!
有爬過小弟文的就知道只要用 
NLP:不好意思剛成交,還有其它不錯的物件要看看嗎?
(剛付訂金)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
為何房仲一直大徵人有何用意???
相信有待過""""保險業""""就知道了!!!沒錯就是學保險業利用""""""緣故""""""也就是想利用新進員工的""""""親朋好友""""""看有沒有""""賣屋""""買屋""""換屋""""""需求!!!!!!
手機都用公司機所以等到都""""熟識了""""老闆就可以進行截生意行動因為是公司機只要""""電話轉接""""就好了!!!!所以不管有沒有後台都會截!!!!因為這就是""""老闆的目的""""喔!!因為都加盟店!!!!!就可以趕走了!!!!
然後有人問再用NLP抺黑一下:說什麼顧客反應態度太差;做事不積極等反正都有話說不然怎麼做""""業務""""!!!!!
接下來我們來看店內一般的格局
--------------------------------------------
l 會議室 l
l l 
l 茶水間 l 
l l
--------------------------------------------
l 看的到辦公桌 l 
l l 
l ------- l 
l l 門 l 
-------------------------------------------- 
因為""""自住客""""看屋時間一定是在""""假日與晚上""""所以平常時段就輪流安排人到""""前場""""也就是辦公桌部份;其它人在""""後場""""研究""""""銷售戰術""""""!!!!!!
所以剛進入這個行業的新人就輔導考照然後發傳單跟名片然後就""""自然淘汰""""了!!
因為""""沒背景後台""""就算有也會""""""慢慢被截斷""""""!!!!!因為要看是那種""""老闆""""!!!!
補充:我們常在蘋果日報上看到那麼多的""""優良房仲""""介紹,真的有那麼優嗎??當然大部份都是有投資客家族背景的不然做廣告幹麻!!!!裡面的內容小故事都差不多!!!
結論:真的需要那麼多房仲嗎???"

414646378558039_681279321894742,"Hello viewers, anyone subscribes to Singtel MIO TV and watches MediaCorp's chinese drama?

We recently encountered that MOD TV program, which subscribers can watch MediaCorp's production earlier than on free-to-air channel on TV, was not available.  We particularly look forward to watch chinese drama series and that was the main reason we subscribed to MIO TV along with the fibre broadband.

Thinking that part of the program was down one morning about one week ago, we made a call to inform Singtel and was surprised to hear that Singtel has discontinued that service!

Singtel said that it has informed subscribers long ago about the discontinuation.  But we didn't receive any notification.  We checked our SMS, email but didn't see any such notice.  And there wasn't any snail-mail on that discontinuation notification as well.

Feeling short-changed, we asked for some kind of adjustments to the MIO TV package but was turned down as Singtel insisted that notification was sent out in advanced to inform subscribers and Singtel would not make any adjustments to the package.  (We did not even see any notification that flash on the TV screen about this program termination service)

The customer service then said that Singtel would write us an official email about this and would take at least a week.  

Did anyone encounter such situation with the MOD TV?

MediaCorp, is there other platforms which you screen chinese drama series in advanced?"

Donna’s reason for writing the Christmas Song For Singapore
Singapore is a thriving metropolis, no doubt it’s high rise & fast paced, but there’s still something really cosy,& comforting & homey about it. It’s like a delicious cup of piping hot chocolate – makes me feel warm & fussy. 

That’s how the X’mas lights & decorations make me feel. 

I don’t know, maybe it’s the fact that Singapore’s a very clean, green, safe place but I  really feel the spirit of X’mas when I walk down Orchard Road and see the amazing lights & decorations, twinkling, glittering & sparkling everywhere. What can I say, I’m “bright-eyed” & “bushy-tailed” & love it when a fantasy land comes to life!

Even though we’re a tiny, teeny weeny island in the sun – I feel like I’m in a Winter Wonderland. And that gives me the same warm fuzzy feeling. 

So because I feel blessed, I wanted to capture the essence of what I feel in a song. That’s why I wrote ‘Christmas in Singapore’. 

Yes, it cost me thousands of dollars to write it, arrange it, record it & produce it – but it’s my X’mas present to Singapore. 

X’mas is a time of love, kindness & giving & ‘Christmas in Singapore’ is my way of ‘paying it forward’. A big “Thank you” for all the love, kindness & joy Singapore & all my Singaporean friends & family have given to me.

This is what touched my heart, and the reason why I wrote this song.

‘Christmas in Singapore’ is free for people to download, enjoy & share with their friends, families & loved ones. All I ask is that people bring the spirit of X’mas to one more person. Share a little more love, a little  more kindness, give that big beautiful warm Singapore smile to one more person -  because Singapore is a beautiful place, it’s a little piece of Heaven on earth & it’s about time we showed the world why we’re so proud of it…..mmwaah! #DonnaDaniels

Out 0f 5.4 million people in Singapore, 2.4 million are foreigners. And maybe 2/5 of Singaporeans are new citizens. Many new citizens bring their obnoxious behaviors from their country of origin. Native Singaporeans have been subjected to campaigns after campaigns for the last few decades and with the proper education from parents, most have evolved into more gracious people. And then the explosion of foreigners and new citizens happened and with that you see littering, spitting, rudeness, abrasive and loud mouthed mannerisms, and all kinds of ungracious behaviors.

BY TCMWELL.COM      
Friday, May 22,2009, 12:52:09 PM   Click: 443


  

 
Prostate cancer researcher says that the Chinese compound ginger and curry powder could bring a glimmer of hope to patients with Kennedy disease, a debilitating Neurode generative condition that affects only men. 
Ginger 


The compound called ASC-J9 and curcumin - the bright yellow spice in curry powder - dramatically slowed the progression of the disease in mice that the man carried the mutant gene that causes the disease, Dr. Yang Zhiming of Zhejiang University in China said Friday the agency Xinhua. 

The tests, conducted by Yang and a research team of Prof. Chawnshang Chang of the University of Rochester Medical Center, involved 60 pairs of mice, each pair consisting of a treatment and untreated mice. 

""The mice that were treated with ASC-J9 are more mobile than their untreated counterparts,"" said Yang. ""They walked better and dragging their legs less often, the muscles seems to work better and they lived 40 per cent of more than untreated mice. "" 

The tests also showed that the treated mice were able to mate and produce offspring, while their untreated partners can not, ""he says. 

Although much more research must be done to see if the compound could be developed into a drug to help people with Kennedy's disease, Dr. Yang says it is a promising development in an area where progress has been slow. 

""It will take several years to develop ASC-J9 into a drug for clinical use, but if successful, it will provide the first cure for Kennedy's disease,"" he said. 

Kennedy's disease, also known as spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, attacks against one of 40,000 people. Symptoms typically include difficulty speaking and swallowing, and weakness in the arms and legs. Patients are often diagnosed in the 30 and 40, and many end up using a wheelchair. 

Yang, 35, was the first author of the study, which appears in the March edition of the journal Nature Medicine. He received his Ph.D. in Chawnshang Professor Chang, a prostate cancer at the University of Rochester Medical Center. 

Professor Chang found earlier that spicy foods, including onions and garlic, cut in May men the risk of prostate cancer by half. 

Ginger is widely used in China as a folk medicine to treat male baldness and promote perspiration to fight against the cold. 

During the last decade, Western medicine has tested curry, finding that the spice can help fight against breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease and the blisters that come after radiation treatment for cancer.

1.	Flash sales and lelong the tickets like some cheapo events.
2.	Carnival. There was so few stalls that it looked and feel cold and empty.
3.	The $100 goodie bag consist of a small tooth of toothpaste, a can of coffee, energy drink, a bag which is a magazine gwp and a brochure. Can I know of it make up $100?
4.	Concert starts at 6pm and the doors open at 7pm. We had to stand for more than an hour waiting for the door to open. 
5.	Concert end at 12 midnight, do you think everyone has no curfew and is rich enough to cab home. Because of the one hour plus delay. Concert start around 730.
6.	 The Avalon (after party) ticket seller only mention 18 years and above for after party after they sold us the ticket. And they did mentioned no refunds and was discussing how sad it is for the some underaged buyer.
7.	The Japanese singers ask us to stand up. When we just stand for the Korean singers(not on chairs), we were scolded by security.. And at the critical moment that the singer move to our side, the security stand in front of us. Thanks a lot.
8.	Horrible seating plan. As cat A, the most expensive ticket. I cannot see the front of the stage. Most performances and singers don’t walked to the side and the TV was right behind my seat. I have to choose between the TV and or stare at the far away tiny figures. How did you decide on my seat being cat A when I see less than most people?
9.	No information on the after party at Avalon so people are waiting aimlessly at the middle of the night outside a club?
10.	Ignore tweet and messages and live your own little world.
11.	SNSD microphone failed…
12. clubbing attire? I see people in pyjamas style tee and old jeans. they don't even care.

There are better things than act out a road rage. I had Julian Hee, a Media Corp actor, flex his muscles and threaten me bodily harm all because of his bad and rude road antics. Pointing out his lane cutting as discourteous and rude, he was unapologetic and calls me 'uncle' after twice very rudely picking my specks off me and throwing it on the road. Despite his level minded passenger friend's plea to act sensibly, he thought it better to flex his muscles and act the bully. Is the guy educated at all? Has he little regard for throwing his weight about and being discourteously obnoxious? Apparently not. Thanks to his friend, we both left in a huff without much bodily harm. What an uncouth punk (for a 46 ye old) without brains. If he was acting it out, it was done poorly and in bad taste from a Media Corp actor wanna be....sheesh!""

Mum: 只唱一首歌不过瘾，而且钟琴不会问问题。

Aunt: 那个许振荣像木头一样不访问，他们永远都不会进步只回原地 踏步， 丢人。

对咯，非常丢人。

叫刘在石来访问一定很好笑，那个钟琴像个花痴自己在那里高兴， 不懂她兴奋什么。金钟国都不知道该给她什么反应好。冷场！唉

说得好！！！

是批评的好，新传媒应该找我去当高层，我一定一个一个找来洗一洗，刷一刷他们的大脑。

Really, what they said was right. Even with an popular oversea artist (RM) and audience's attention, the entire episode was a big flop. It didn't meet the standards it should have."

Christopher Lim playing the role of the expert con-artist who went to jail and Jessica Liu as the girl who got conned by a guy and seeks his help? 
By filming this, you have pissed off many people. Please have some originality. I can even state more scenes that happened in the Gameplan which is exactly like Liar Game. Just by changing the language to Chinese and the incidents that occured doesn't cover the fact that you copied off another film. Let me guess, there will be another sequel to Gameplan and a movie about the final episode? Let me predict the ending for your Gameplan. They 2 managed to cheat the money of the man and he falls into debt. The girl feels sorry and returns her share of the money cheated from him. The con-artist who helped her, who is promised half of what she has also returns the money to the man because the girl didn't receive any money. PLEASE HAVE SOME ORIGINALITY MEDIACORP.
