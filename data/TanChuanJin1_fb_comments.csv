1244873388888767_1245098425532930,"Sorry, I can't agree with you. The caption says Walk of Wonder. What did it say besides just the names of the models? And the hashtag? It mentions INCLUSIVENESS!! What do hunks got to do with us with special needs? Hunks will steal our limelight, then the fashion walk won't even be called Walk Of Wonder. 

It's OUR fashion walk, where we are given an opportunity to shine despite our special needs, letting the audience see our inner beauty and just be the real selves. To show the audience we CAN do the fashion walk too!!! Remember, fashion walk isn't always for the prettiest or handsomest tall models.",Isabelle Lim,2,2016-10-22 12:12:02
1244873388888767_1245104558865650,"Nah Isabelle you misunderstood my point. The while point of this runway is to ensure inclusivity. Just as the helpers remain ubiquitous, the male or female models represent embracing truly that the runway belongs to anyone. If you want to make a point, make it big. Share the limelight with people who do this for a living. And gather inclusivity there.",Stephanie Ann Kessler,0,2016-10-22 12:19:41

People need to know there is no absolutely shame in seeking professional help, the sooner you are diagnosed the easier it is to know how to handle when you feel the triggers coming. Raising awareness is so important to understand, identify symptoms in your loved ones and initiate help. It is often challenging for sufferers to share what they're experiencing, when others around them can only imagine. Kudos!",Jingying Chan,0,2016-10-15 08:14:50

1230243567018416_1230671323642307,"Thank You Minister Tan Sir in supporting an inclusive representation such as of our women in our major institutionalised entities. Our People's Action Party has constantly delivered promises and on the matter of gender equity imho we also fair exceptionally well. I wish to add on slightly that mothers hold a crucial transformative role in our Population White Paper and we probably should have a mother on each and every functional board for a future to be possible. Amen.

Have you seen families constantly moving house because they are in debt? Have you seen people committing suicide with their family because they couldn't break away?

1224306297612143_1224346904274749,"Things are not as easy when u really have a special needs child. Special needs child with high IQ is being put into mainstream school, and mainstream school's teachers are not train to handle them and so the kids suffer from being bullied by classmates and school mates. No matter how many times u file complain against the school bullies, nothing much can be done and u are being told by the school that u have to teach ur own special needs child how to handle school bullying instead of the school teaching the other children how to get along with special needs children..... 

On the surface it seems to the gov that everything is fine, but when u really have a special needs child then u will know the challenge that we face everyday. School principle and teachers need to be taught more on how to handle special needs kids since they have to be in mainstream school and not keep asking parents to ""teach"" our special needs kids how to mix in with the rest of the kids. 

I wish I could put my child in a special needs school so he will not be bullied daily but was told his IQ is high so he have to be in mainstream school to suffer all the way throughout his school years...... Yes, his IQ is very high, he is always the top student in his whole level for Maths, he is only in Pri 5 but his teacher is already telling me he is able to take 'O' level maths exam, a parent should be super happy hearing this but so what? My son have to suffer being bullied by classmates/school mates almost daily for who he is. What's so great about being top in his level when he is suffering daily in school? Reaching home crying over what's happening in school and nobody is helping him as he can't express himself and teachers are not caring enough to handle these kind of kids. 

Until such day when our gov decide to have special school for high IQ special needs kids, we will just continue to suffer......",Sharon Glacier Ho,7,2016-09-29 07:44:56
1224306297612143_1224350270941079,There are many special kids out there that are struggling. My daughter has selective mutism and will build a wall around herself when she is out of her comfort zone.

1224306297612143_1224356630940443,"While we constantly speaks of kids with autism, have we also forgotten about kids who are dyslexic? 

They do need special coaching in school as well and while many of them struggle in reading and writing, many of times, they felt stupid and different from their peers.  Their working memory is weaker as well and that makes learning even harder. 

Not that they are stupid but they faces challenges in their learning and learning support needs to be in place for this group of children as well.

I agree that NIE Teachers should also be train to identify kids with special needs, instead of branding them straight being lazy or lack of support at home.  Talks should be held in school by DAS to impact Teachers with knowledge.  

Education is not purely working on KIP to Ensure their school top the ranking non to produce best student among its peers.

Last but not least, AED or LSD in mainstream school should be given equivalent treatment and adopt their suggestions in helping kids with special needs and not ignoring their suggestion or just simply find it challenging to accommodate it into the school.

It's also a lesson in managing expectations - if you can't intervene because it's a civil matter, say so upfront, explain what you're going to do to mediate so that folks know that there is a likelihood of no resolution, not from want of trying.

Many of them having disputes with their neighbors don't go face to face with each other !  Yes, we know sometimes some are ridiculously unreasonable, then they should approach government agency for assist. But they must treat community volunteers respect !
Think about in the beginning of Singapore no MPS and not so many social assist channels, what do the people then do? Volunteers have to prioritize what is more important to tackle first and who are the people they should help first.

Can a resident use hdb flat as industrial workshop? I have read tt there is a guideline n rules for resident to go by n it clearly state tt resident are not allow to use residential area for industrial purposes.
Towncouncil is not able to convince this unit to stop their inconsiderate act.Towncouncil is also unable to do much wif the clutter(storage place,fish pond,huge unkempt plants,Ebike n bicycle,broken metal pcs)at the common corridor of this particular unit.Common corridors Shld be kept clear from all obstruction n tc Shld put a restriction when the resident misused the area.Every estate has such problem of cluttering along corridor n hoarding for territory space.Why won't the Govt pass the law down to restrict the use of such common area.It will help to reduce dispute among Neighbours n the corridor wld be clear fr obstruction.Pls do consider bring this up.And there is a rule tt state citizen are not to use residential area for industrial work,just don't understand why tc does not enforce the law in this  case?",Suzanne Sum Sock Peng,0,2016-09-22 08:50:55

The only choice that they don't have in life is the disability. Let us encourage them and the rest of the disabled within our society. Treat them the same way as an abled body does if they outshine at the Olympics, if we want our disabled to also gain similar treatment and recognition in our society. Their rewards whether in monetary forms or otherwise should not differ from that of an otherwise non-disabled person.

But some sources claim that a nurse named Phyllis McCormack wrote it. Her son said she sent it in to a local magazine anonymously. 
This old lady had copied the poem in her handwriting and it was found when she died.
But I am not sure how accurate this is. The conventional wisdom and most consistent story is the one about this being found in the possessions of this old lady after she passed on.",Tan Chuan-Jin,3,2016-09-13 15:47:07

1210525792323527_1211146938928079,"This is not urgent, but lowly me agrees with what You say about counselling suicidal teenagers. http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/not-reasonable-to-expect-teenagers-to-take-crisis-calls-from-suicidal-peers-tan-chuan-jin This is not flattery. In my primary school my classmate an orphan died falling from a height while chilling out with friends on a late night, in secondary school a girl from my other session jumped off 25 storeys near my window seat because her boyfriend that dumped her was sitting by the window facing the HDB block, she wanted her death to be visible by her supposed ex. In my college days before I enlisted my classmate 'Dean' or 'Teck Oon' who cracked the most jokes suddenly went on a beer session with our classmates upon booking out from Tekong, in a drunkun stupor he also jumped down from a similar height and skipped army, university and life completely.

I never managed to advise myself about their deaths, but I am not yet dead enough to suggest that if I had received the same phone call again on 28 December 1999 one day before enlisting, I still won't know how to handle his suicide.

Even till today not my friend or classmate, but when I heard of not Benjamin Lim but a school girl at Spectra Secondary School doing parkour and fourth floor it seems then falling from the same height onto the ground floor then dying, I still never figured out what was she trying to do because the usual pakour in USA seldom seem that suicidal.",Rongxiang Lin,0,2016-09-13 08:41:33

1193565627352877_1194376203938486,"My family, friends and I are deeply saddened by the news of the demise of the 6th President of Singapore, Mr. S. R. Nathan. 

He was an extraordinary man whose nature was down-to-earth, humble, kind hearted and of all a great man who marked religious, moral and social cohesion for the Nation, Community and Society. 

With great intellectual honesty, he did not hesitate to review the poverty for the needy and at the same time, he piloted streams of charity events to raise funds. 

Throughout he observed human beings in all dimensions in order to establish a new civilization that would be more realistic and enduring: the civilization of love. 

The loss of this great man who led an honourable life has made a deep impression on the minds and hearts of all Singaporeans. 

His vision of life was truly remarkable. His teachings and guidance also strengthened us and made us more determined to act with greater equity. These are the sentiments with which we should follow. 

We are all mourning this great man, with sincere grief, for we have lost the true friend of our human journey, and the sentiment we all feel in these days is profound loneliness. 

We would like to express our sincere Heartfelt Condolences on the loss of the great man and our hearts go out to the family of Mdm. Urmila, loved ones and extended families! 

May his divine soul be blessed and rest in peace! 

Death only comes to those who leave no memories; for whose existence was cherished, they will always be alive in the chambers of the heart.

My heart was heavy and the feeling was like it's sinking into a bottomless ocean, I don""t know why but I just kept mumbling ""No, Please, No, Not again"". I glued to the TV waiting for updates, not on his speech but his condition.
When I heard the announcement that PM is Ok and is going to continue with this ""very important"" National Day Rally....I got angry, and YES, ANGRY !!!
I do not know what happened behind the scene, a powerful jab to allow th PM to continue ? A contingency plan (BCM) in place in an event something worst happens ?
PM resumed his speech. ""Minister or not, we are all mortal"" - LHL 
I started to texted one of my friend, and told him that I would like to put up a petition....that all Ministers and MPs should be well rested and even more so when they are not feeling well.
They must always remember that they are people elected Members of Parliament.
The people trusted them and gave them the mandate, hence, they must not betray the trust of the voters.
They should take good care of themselves before they have the physical and mental capabilities to take care of the Nation and the people.
I implore, Please.....
This is a risk too risky for Singaporeans to absorb should the condition exacerbates.
Yes, you are correct PM LHL, you gave us a scare, a scare to ponder in depth that upon your stumble, will Singapore tumble ?
Please, to all of you, we voted you into parliament to give us security and not scares. 
We understand it's not just the nation you are taking care of, it includes the regional and the global issues at large....
Noentheless, have enough rest and take care of yourselves before you can take care of the Nation and the people.

Divine Discontent

Material things.

Simply wonderful.

He will need lots of rest under close observation by his medic team.

======

PM Lee said at the NDR:

Recently, somebody asked me at a dialogue ""If God appeared before you and asked you for three things that you would want for Singapore, what would these be?""

I was taken aback. I thought for a while and replied: If we wish for material things, we will regret it, because after we have got it, we will not be satisfied and we will want more. 

But what I would like is that we be blessed with a divine discontent - always dissatisfied with where we are; always driven to do better. 

And yet, that we have the wisdom to count our blessings, so that we know how precious Singapore is, and we know how to enjoy and protect it.

If just these two wishes are fulfilled, that will be enough. Then we can keep on building something special in Singapore for many more years, and ""Achieve Happiness, Prosperity, and Progress, for our nation"".

Thank you and Good Night

Please rest well and take good care of your health... Please do not over-stretched yourself.... Singapore need high calibre people like you in the Government cabinet..... Please do not drive when you are too tired........
I had a very narrow escape recently in Perth. On my way back from morning exercise and shopping, feeling slightly hot and sleepy! I dozed off on the wheel in a split second and my car went to the opposite lane and onto the footpath. Woke up immediately and took control of the car. Luckily there's no oncoming traffic and no one was on the pavement. A car that has just drove past on the opposite lane stopped further down the road (to check what has happened to me?) If the car was slightly slower in speed, my car would have hit it. I did not stop my car and continued my journey, in shock and fully awoken.",Joyce Tan,1,2016-08-20 02:11:40

1188086151234158_1188128511229922,"Thank you for sharing. Team SG had done well. The simple fact that they qualified for The Olympics is a great achievement.

Many do not have that little bit more to stand on the podiums, but they are all our heroes, our representatives - and very honorable ones.
To know they lack that little bit more means they can quantitatively set their next focus. And that's what competition is all about. NEVER TO GIVE UP THE ULTIMATE GOAL.

I'm sure most people in Singapore understand and appreciate all their hard work as well as their frustrations. For a small nation to be able to send a small contingent to The Olympics is already something - that we have citizens who can measure against the world. So it's not money or time wasted by Singapore.

Perhaps the trainings in Singapore can include extensive psychological preparation for competitions - especially high level ones; to support and help athletes deal with competition situations and the media. That can surely groom our future sportsmen and women to the highest level of their potentials.",Keen Fei Tang,53,2016-08-18 19:32:55

1188086151234158_1188226627886777,"Hello sir,

Thanks for the sharing.  Please permit me to  share some of my thoughts after reading the piece.

1.) There is no shame if we have done our best and with heart.  It's called honourable.

2.) We are all entitled to our privacy - yes even celebrities and star athletes.  It's called respect.

3.) The news media for all its intent and purpose was suppose to be doing objective reporting, not sensationalise or get too personal because they are snubbed.  It's called being professional.

4.)  Before we judge, let's make sure we are blameless first.  It's called mindfulness.

5.)  If one thinks our athletes aren't doing their all and best at the games, tell you what, whoever comments negatively - let's see you do it right by participating in the games and win.  It's called put your money where your mouth is.

I for one am proud of all our athletes who represent professionalism, courage, endurance, sportsmanship, and a whole lot of never-say-die attitude.

It isn't about the win or lose, but the willingness to take the challenge(s) and attempt to come up on top.  If we win along the way, let's be humble; if we lost, be reflective and try again.

By the way, the real prize ... isn't the medals or the tallies - its how we conduct ourselves at any games, and how we as a nation show appreciation for the participants on the games grounds - win or lose.

My 2-bit humble opinion.

GO TEAM SINGAPORE GO!",Ian Goh,29,2016-08-18 22:08:17

I applaud her courage in sharing those thoughts that are personal and they provide insights into the mind of athletes competing at the highest level.

There are many unpleasant people in life, and we should not expect anything different on social media. The good and the bad are all mixed into long threads of postings in forums or Facebook. Some words can be hurtful while others may be supportive and kind. 

I just hope that athletes like Ting Wen will not react to all the things written about them but to respond in ways that help them to grow and be really good at what they are passionate about.

I am proud of Ting Wen and all our Team Singapore athletes, coaches and officials. They have represented our country well and I applaud their efforts and courage to want to be the best.

Mere ordinary folks if they have nothing constructive to say, it is better for them to keep to themselves.  On social media, there are a lot of people who seem to like to vent their own frustrations with their own lives, on others whom they see as performing well at different levels.  So you get people who want to remind us of something that happened 8 years ago when they see all the joys of celebrating a gold medalist, they want to comment on someone being not professional because they didn't stop to comment for the press, and start talking about 'foreign' representation vs local talents.  Why leave all this aftertaste of bitterness.  Athletes are humans too.  They  train hard, much harder than any of us, mere mortals and if they win, let's congratulate them.  If they do not win, let's still wish them all the best because this was just not their time yet.  There is no need too for the athletes to bother with such negative criticism too.  Just treat them as the inconveniences of having to live with all sorts of people on this tiny earth that we have.  Rejoice and embrace and then strive to better the challenges ahead.

Those that are more expressive will show their feeling through any ways possible, well those that are not so, may talk between friends, colleagues, etc

Think of it, why does the government introduce policies? It is because the citizens talk about certain issues which they hope the government will look into it. If the citizens are impassive, the government may just overlook it. Tweaking of policies does not involve only the upper echelons of the government.

I notice the government keeps emphasising on the SPEC scholarships, but are these really enough? And should there be more Athletes in the program? The government is so focused on academic scholarship that anything related to sports seem to be an afterthought. I understand that we need to allocate our Budget carefully. But I am sure all can see the tremendous psychological effect Schooling's win has on the nation. It really uplifted the confidence of the locals and we realised we are actually better than we (are made to) think.",Maria Lai,1,2016-08-17 02:32:04

Sports in modern days is so complex and technical, every aspect is costly and difficult to achieve without strong support. 
I still believe Mindef and mcys can do much better in your sportsman career path by providing some scholarships in overseas with ambassor duties instead of NS deferment/exemption. You and schooling has become ambassadors for professional sports which is unheard of for many years. Our swimming industry now weighs on your shoulders to bring the best for years to come and Singapore may be a platform for developing top swimmers in the long future. May our govt do more for these boys as such pairing is a rare pair and doesnt come very often! it took more than 10yrs for them to reach this level and with the right support, they could reach phenomenon levels in 3-5yrs.

Noting imho the fact that President Dr Tony Tan was also on this trip, Minister Tan made the right decision in showing up back home somewhat as President's escort. 

I also wish to highlight in my limited capacity as a Singaporean, especially since the Singapore Customs durian bus debate, that a Brigadier General as well as Cabinet Minister is NOT a supernumerary estab title whether during peacetime or in times of uncertainty. I may thank the Good Lord instead that my leaders and olympian had a safe trip to and fro, Terence imho, please understand also the worries of other Singaporeans, we are NOT a country that has time for petty politics the likes of Trump's or Workers'.

The moment our ministers come home safely, we are already pushing for a new bill to honour olympians in parliament, whereas some where far far away in the continent of South America there is still a President from the Workers' Party that is still being impeached and it has been taking so many years God knows how many Brazilians have starved till death because of an impeachment exercise amidst an Olympics.",Rongxiang Lin,3,2016-08-15 05:08:32

This morning I was there as a cameraman for a sports channel and I will like to say SSC staffs really organised this very badly!! Most of the media were told to be at the media area and unfortunately they allowed the public to join in that area causing us being squeezed! Understand they are passionate about it but the worst thing was all the SSC staffs were in there with their phone taking photos and videos of JS, blocking all the medias' cameras! Don't understand why those not involved were in there and causing obstructions to the media. I hope this can be improved in the future! Those who are not doing anything should not be in there at all or they should be standing behind JS so that the media can get some better shots!",YK Oh,0,2016-08-15 14:21:42

I do hope that Singapore government has heard the one voice of all Singaporeans with regards to Joseph Isaac Schooling deferment which is until 31 August 2016, with less than 3 weeks remaining. More than just celebrating the victory, I do hope that Singapore government would allow Joseph Isaac Schooling to continue his daily training swimming regime to aim for 100M Butterfly Swimming World Record timing.

1184163944959712_1184325151610258,"This Olympic gold medal is a reminder to JS that he beat a stella field littered with National, World and Olympic champions. It also represents  countless hours of hard work, toil and sacrifice + the supporting cast of family, coaches and the state in his NS deferment. While NS is important, I feel JS should be exempted from NS or delayed until his swimming days are over. He is an EXCEPTIONAL talent. If he serves the 2 years of NS now, his training and momentum would be very hard to regain or even gone. He has to continue his training and guidance under Eddie Reese and Sergio Lopez in the US, all the way through Tokyo 2020 and beyond if he wants to. Training in SG is good but only up to a certain level. The level of competition in the US is far higher and more intense and that is what keeps a top class athlete on his feet. The SEA Games and World Swimming Championships is next year 2017, the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games is in 2018, another SEA Games and World Swimming Championships is in 2019, and the BIG one, is the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games where JS would be 24 years old and at his peak . I don't have the solution but its up to the state, family and JS himself to work things out to ensure his training and preparations are not disrupted. Momentum is the key word. Help JS's mind to remain clear, focused and free of distractions.",Matthew Liew,24,2016-08-14 01:31:30

What are you planning to do after Joseph Schooling comes back to Singapore from Rios? Push him to National Service where his swimming training would ceases for 2 years long? I do hope that his daily swimming training continues, while he serves his duty in National Services. Keep in mind, the next goal is to break the world record in 100M Butterfly Swimming. By ceasing all daily swimming training would not help him reach this goal. I earnest hope the Singapore government hears and does something fruitful out of this result.

My kids also noted that Joseph Schooling had been singing along our Singapore National Anthem 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👏🏻👏🏻

Why I highlighted this here ??

There were a few time I noticed that 100% Singapore-born school kids, youths and adults chose to keep quiet n not sing National Anthem, they didn't feel proud to be Singaporeans ?! Don't feel part of it ?!

Yesterday there were FB postings on JS as a foreign talent etc.. 

Each day when we talk about Patriotism, talk about Love our country, it's really actions speak louder than words, net citizens agree or not ?

What are you planning to do after Joseph Schooling comes back to Singapore from Rios? Push him to National Service where his swimming training would ceases for 2 years long? I do hope that his daily swimming training continues, while he serves his duty in National Services. Keep in mind, the next goal is to break the world record in 100M Butterfly Swimming. By ceasing all daily swimming training would not help him reach this goal. I earnest hope the Singapore government hears and does something fruitful out of this result.

Push him to National Service where his swimming training would ceases for 2 years long? I do hope that his daily swimming training continues, while he serves his duty in National Services. Keep in mind, the next goal is to break the world record in 100M Butterfly Swimming. By ceasing all daily swimming training would not help him reach this goal.

Please check who is this Low Li Fhong (Todays's reporter) in Rio ?
She posted on the Today's Facebook, she purposely emphasized ""ZhengWen last 16 "" ..

I commented on her post of Today's 
Facebook:

Today's Sport's reporter Low Li Fhung in Rio?
Why captioned purposely emphasize on ""last 16 "" ?
You are so petty just because of ZhengWen did  not entertain you when he lost his Pet event days before ? So now you keep on using beating word on ZhenWen ? He was sad when he lost his  Pet event, owing you nothing that he should talk to you or entertain you ?
By this, revealed your character too, in fact very negative n toxic ?

1173139099395530_1173177439391696,"My family and I are deeply saddened by the news of 6th President of Singapore Mr. S. R. Nathan's ill health.  

He has done a lot for Singapore as a civil servant par excellence, holding key positions in security, intelligence and foreign affairs, and as a people's President. 

His immeasurable contributions means alot for the Nation, Community and Society. 

Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time. 

We join our hands in prayer to proclaim his healing. 

May the almighty God's blessing be with him for a very smooth and speedy recovery! 

God bless!

1169922566383850_1170086569700783,"To kill innocent is the crime and the cuplrit should be punished.

Terrorism is above all murder. Murder is strictly forbidden in the Qur'an. Qur'an 6:151 says, ""and do not kill a soul that God has made sacrosanct, save lawfully."" (i.e. murder is forbidden but the death penalty imposed by the state for a crime is permitted). 5:53 says, ""… whoso kills a soul, unless it be for murder or for wreaking corruption in the land, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind; and he who saves a life, it shall be as if he had given life to all mankind.""

If the motive for terrorism is religious, it is impermissible in Islamic law. It is forbidden to attempt to impose Islam on other people. The Qur'an says, ""There is no compulsion in religion. The right way has become distinct from error."" (-The Cow, 2:256). Note that this verse was revealed in Medina in 622 AD or after and was never abrogated by any other verse of the Quran.

Do not lose faith in humanity and the good in people. I choose to believe that good will triumph over evil, and I hope you too.

We are depending on our leaders to lead us in developing an inclusive society - one that embraces all regardless of race, colour or religion; one that promotes self reliance and where opportunities abound for everybody to thrive, as long as you put in the effort; one that is filled with love and compassion and which takes care of the less fortunate (including the mentally ill) as well as those who, despite our best efforts, fall through the cracks.

As a volunteer myself on the ground who works with the homeless, these words that you wrote resonate a lot with me, because they sound, well, a lot like someone who's been real tired and reflective after a long hard night of helping people - some appreciative and some less so. The tone... is really from one who walks the ground. Cannot fake. Haha. And that's something that earns my respect.

*pause*

Thank you so much for the down-to-earth realness and compassion too, Minister Tan. While there are days that we may agree or disagree with your viewpoints  — one thing for sure: you really do walk the talk. :) and ... they do encourage me personally, because sometimes, well, it's awfully encouraging to know that you too face the same kind of heartaches and concerns and ""seriously..."" moments that we ordinary volunteers on the ground also face. 

And that's something I'm so proud of, as a fellow Singaporean. So just want to encourage you to keep on giving all you have daily to serve our fellow citizens, because your labor is not in vain.

Thank God for you, Sir!",Yeo Yeu Ann,76,2016-07-20 17:32:52

都是我的错 你对人的好 是一种诱惑
都是我的错 在你人群中 总是在巴士里，有说有笑的不会寂寞
都是你的错 我发白日梦， 像一个魔咒 被你的举动变成我是 hai gong

我承认都是榴莲惹的祸 那样的排队太慢你太从容

我承认都是PNGTANG惹的祸 偏偏似笨如呆说来去骗人

If it was not possible to queue due to his security personnel (but what's the big deal about firearms? There are loads of firearms carried by customs security personnel too?) or not possible to queue in the very crowded area because of security threat to him as minister (and this is probably true), then I'm sure it is possible for him to clear customs and wait in a secure area.
You see, at the crux of this incident is the perception that if you are PAP grassroots, you will get all sorts of unfair privileges. There has long been urban legends of how PAP grassroots won't get summon in Hdb car parks, or how their kids no need to ballot can get into schools. And I really honestly have no idea if there is any truth in these urban legends at all, but when a bus load of people get whisked through customs very visibly like that, surely enough people will view that as ""proof"" that such unfair privileges are real and everywhere.

1. How did TCJ travel to the open house?  He traveled with his residents to and fro?
2. If he traveled on bus with residents to JB, was he given express clearance when he going JB?  What about those on same bus as him?
3. Since he traveled by bus, does it mean the residents also went for the open house?  Or did the bus dropped him off at the open house on the way? If not on the way, then was it quite inconvenient which I don't think he would like to put his residents in?  If he traveled by private car before joining the residents, then has he thought about any implication if he travel by bus back together?  See point 5.
4. Can we assume he went for the open house before joining residents for the durian trip?  So did he consider his official duty as minister ended when he joined the residents?
5. As a minister, this is not the first time he visit msia on official duty and probably knows he will gets special clearance.  If he is traveling with armed security and will be given express clearance, could he explain to the residents that he has a different queue?  I'm sure the residents will understand.  He can then choose to wait for the rest on the bus.
6. If he sees his official duty as minister ended the moment he left the open house, does he sees himself as a MP on an outing with the residents and choose to queue along with them?

I do not agree to the reason that just because he was given express clearance, the rest of people on the same bus should be given the same treatment so the bus can goes off and not jam up the custom.  Has he thought what if he wasn't on the bus?  Those people will still have to queue and the bus will still have to wait.

My question is what are the rest of the people thinking when they saw this?  Did anyone say the same as Png?

And by the way, how was it like at the M'sia custom side?  Mr Tan may be given fast or special clearance.  What about those on same bus as him?",Ken Ho,4,2016-07-20 03:17:46

Minister Tan deserves expedited clearance for all trips but surely not the rest of residents on the bus going to eat durian right? I doubt that is ""international practice"" as u claim... Usually the expedited clearance is only for officials and those in their entourage who are there for official purposes.

1164727446903362_1164910080218432,"I was reading all the comments made both in his post and CNA.  To be honest, was very heartening that many people stood up for him, only to show how well liked he is as a person. 

I was one of the residents who went for the durian trip (not his bus thou and we queued for 30mins too), and I thought I should come out and  to give any account of what I thought was happening on the ground. 

From first getting to know, Chuan-Jin Tan in the Asian Tsunami, then the Army, to becoming my senior in LSE/ LKYSPP and now becoming my MP.  I thought will sort of give me a little right to tell you what he is as a person. Quiet as he may be, he lets his action do the talking, and if there is one thing that everyone who knows him agrees is that, he is all for his people. 

He spent the Saturday running the Ekiden race, and stayed back to wait for everyone of his team mates to return, all under the hot sun so that he can fellowship with them. He could had been the VIP, if he choses to. He is a minister right? But no, he said, he came as his personal capacity so he will race together with the crowd… Finished the race caused a great deal of his strength, nearly losing balance due to exhaustion but still didn't refuse when request were made by the public who wants to take photos with him even before he could catch his breath..  Humble, humane and all for his people.. 

He could have made his official visit trip first thing in the morning before heading off to the durian trip and spend time with his residents. But he chose to be with his residents first, only to squeeze out some time (when they went for shopping) to make his official visit and came back by dinner so that he can continue to fellowship with his residents. He could had been in a private car but chose to be in the same bus because he wants to spend time with his people. I happened to be beside him when his assistant said that he is running late for his official visit but there was one bus of resident that had yet to arrive. He said, lets wait a bit longer. Why so? Because he had always put his residents at the top priority. 

The only fault I could find from him over this incident was that, he actually refused to be in a private car at his comfort but wanted to be seated in the same bus as his residents. As a result, they were being facilitated only to be politicize by a fellow parliamentarian who claims that all they want is to have a first world parliament. 

学长， 百翻算计， 也不如一颗单纯的心。部长到底是怎样的人， 你我心知肚明。我只是一个普通老百姓， 但我今天站出来挺你，不是因为你是部长而是我知道你是真心为民， 所以值得我们用生命来守护。 

There are so many so many people rallying behind you today because you are true to your people and that your sincerity moved hearts... 你我同心， 真的都是为国为民。

1164727446903362_1165137000195740,"Dear Mr Tan,
It is good that you highlight your experiences at the checkpoints. Perhaps more could be done to improve conditions for both travelers as well as the ICA staff on duty.
1) The roads leading up to woodlands is badly congested and unorganized- partly due to the queue jumpers and motorbikes that weave in at out of traffic. 
2)The speed humps, and narrow lanes are both an irritation as well as reduces traffic speed a bit too much. Exiting the passport control after passport checks at the booth -can sometimes takes 15 minutes or more. Because the other vehicles don't give way to each other. But that is because the roads and lanes and badly planned out.
3) it's much worse and dangerous at the start of the causeway, because cars and motorcycles are forced to share a single lane. If anyone with ill intentions wanted to cause major disruption to our country -This is an ideal location for them to do so.
At the same time, a 'simple fender' bender could similarly have the same effect.
3) The inspectors at the re-entry points back into SG are obviously understaffed (and perhaps overworked) I have seen a single officer *control 3 booths.
(*Meaning checking the vehicles , and manning the gentry.)
Do consider just how much one person can achieve, or the time taken for each car. The delay is further multiplied if something illegal is found as it requires a more through check, thereafter. All these happens while each vehicle is awaiting it's turn, and more cars are joining the queue.
At the very least, a minimum of only one officer per booth should 
deployed. There should also be a supervisor or visible roving staff/s backing up these officers - with a more realistic ratio of perhaps, 3 men is to 1 supervisor.
The main concern is, if security is so distracted- how can they perform effectively?
4) The exit after the passport control is also a mess. It's too narrow, unnecessary angles and disruptive. The speed humps are excessive and the bottlenecks would be a dangerous tool for anyone with ill intentions......
5) the journey to the Immigration hall from woodlands by foot is very long. Hopefully  travelators like at the airport can be installed.
6)Immigration clearance is above average, and the staff are very courteous and pleasant.  
7)It's fair if staff are deployed to provide faster clearance for Ministerial organized groups. As long as it doesn't take away duty staff and forces their booths to be closed. The simple answer would be more staff strength at all the above.
8) Tuas re-entry, is also very undermanned.
There was a time it took us 4 plus hours starting immediately after the Malaysian side to get into ICA SG , Tuas.
Traffic was backed up that badly.
9) have you considered that since we pride ourselves on being among the very best, in efficiency.
That the entry points (except our airport and ICA halls) is very unorganised , inefficient and needs a complete review?
Consider tourists , arriving through Malaysia via road. What kind of first impression will they have of our country?
Can't we overcome this barrier, it really doesn't take much to reorganise this.",Mark Roche,2,2016-07-20 00:13:58

1164727446903362_1165169043525869,"I think Png mentioned specifically that while he was fine with you being given privileges to cut the queue because of your position, he was wondering why your entourage (not your security team, but the volunteers you spoke of) didn't join the regular queue. 

Other people there also arrived by bus, queued normally, and left by bus. Perhaps he was wondering why didn't you and your sec team be on a separate, specific vehicle which will leave once you clear customs, while the others take the normal queue. Their buses can wait. Other buses are also waiting for their respective passengers.

I don't care for Png personally, I know that if I was in the queue and I saw you being given privileges to go through, I wouldn't be surprised. Because as you stated, royalty and politicians usually need to get clear quickly for security reasons. No issues there for me.

But if a whole lot of other people also got to join you in cutting the queue, I would honestly get really pissed off too. And I would also speak about it on social media. The common thought running would be ""they hang out with the minister so they also cut queue?!""

So if you want to stay with them, you will need to forgo that right and wait with the group. But if you choose to exercise that right (and you are certainly entitled to do so), you will need to step away from the group and go at it alone. It's not an easy decision on the spot at that moment, and often it's not even fair to you, but this is the reality. Because you, Sir, are a minister, people will scrutinise every word you say and everything you do.",Timothy Khoo,5,2016-07-20 10:47:13

The resident is warned n told to license the dog regardless of whether it is owned by the resident.  So many govt bodies decend on one HDB unit bec it is a RC vice chair.

Over the years Mr Kunalan has been hosting 100's of his ex-students at home during almost every Xmas. Despite so many students, their spouses n children, Mr Kunalan seems to be able to remember every single one of our name . At his home, how he interacted with his guests make you understand why so many people love n respect this man. He is warm, humble , humorous, dedicated and very professional in all the roles he play; As a father, teacher, professional etc etc. And most of all, his role as a loving and caring husband to his wife.

1155883527787754_1155902661119174,"Hahaha. Let me try.... Use dark dark piece of glass in front of lens until very little light go through, so shutter open long long, like that can capture moving water effect. Lens wide wide to capture more of scene. Shutter open for two minutes....so instead of click-clack, you hear click.........two minutes.....then clack. F9 doesn't mean FAIL! Size of hole (of camera...let's use aperture, sounds better...F9 is about medium size so for most part of scene should be sharp). Hmm. ISO64 is .... Sensitivity of sensor? Less sensitive so need more light, but also means image should be finer and sharper. Hope this helps? Clearly I can't teach this for nuts! 😁",Tan Chuan-Jin,15,2016-07-06 13:45:45

I'm sure many Singaporeans are shocked that this happens in first world Singapore and are calling for heavier sentence on the 2. But beyond punitive measures, I think public education on child protection is also an area to review.

While children in the formal education system can be monitored by their teachers and counsellors, we wonder if children under 7 and not attending pre-schools fall out of our radar until something like that happens? This is especially crucial for the at-risk group (does MSF have a definition for children at risk?). What can be done better to monitor their well-being? Do we check on these children regularly? What can be done to educate people who may not have access to fb and may not get to read this message you posted? I think public education in this area needs to be stepped up and be more targeted. Is MSF reviewing it's processes to better prevent such cases in the future? One is too many for our nation to bear.",Ivay Tan,3,2016-06-24 19:01:53

1148464428529664_1149811865061587,"They do not deserve to be parents and I'm afraid their actions led to death. Making them murderers of this mother's child. 8-10 years where we are clothing and feeding these inhumane people is too good a punishment. They were obviously having trouble making ends meet as cleaners (sharing a flat with a few other housemates) - but is this the way to treat a child? (Even if not by current boyfriend?!) 
I'm sorry to sound so forward but really, they deserve death. They have 10 other charges against them and I hope they get their rightful punishment. 
They should not get to parent their 1 year old. Ever. Sure as parents we all have bad days - smack on the hands or bum. But force feed chilli? Stomp on the chest and twisting his arm? What animals are these people?!!!? 
I'm glad the innocent boy is in a better place, bless his soul. He did nothing to deserve this treatment from his own mother. The only thing that is different? His father is not the mother's current boyfriend. 
MFS - do better. Make sure they don't get to be parents again. 
And don't make light of the situation. Longer sentences do not rehabilitate people like this. Jail is actually a good life for these murderers - being clothed and fed for the next 8-10 years. Much nicer than trying to make ends meet as cleaners and taking out frustrations on an innocent toddler.",Ruth Chew,1,2016-06-26 08:16:56

1140952222614218_1141625555880218,"We came here to be enlightened. It is only in the physical world that our souls can make progress because this is the world of manifestation. No other planets anywhere else in the universe except here on earth. Every lifetime we came back to make some progress until we are finally perfect and attain our true divine nature. 

The universal quest for world peace is a spiritual quest. World peace can never become a living reality unless every single human being is enlightened. 

The true purpose on earth is to attain full enlightenment through divine development in a human body. Jesus did it and so did Buddha. Through meditation and prayer, we will bring peace back to earth : This is our true purpose on earth. 

We are at the crossroad of great changes. One enlightened master had been sent back to earth to guide. He conducted meditations for 37 years at the United Nations. Lifted several elephants, and 8,000 people including Mohd Ali and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, drawn 16 million soul birds, composed 20,000 songs, written 1,600 books. But the world remain deaf and blind due to darkness. He had left with us his wisdom. 20-100 years from now, His light will be appreciated more than now.",Yap Thian Beng,0,2016-06-13 14:37:55

If we forsake this duty, we will never be happy in this life or in many other lives. To tell you the truth, this is the only reason for human suffering and nothing else. But as soon as we are born into this world, we forget everything because it is the law of the material world to let people forget. All worldly matters, no matter what they are passion, wealth, position, knowledge are not our obstacles. It is we who hinder ourselves. Since we cherish and attached to these matters, we give them the power to chain and manipulate us. If we have not given them the power, we can then use them to benefit others as well as ourselves. Except that we turn back again to our birthright, to our birth duty, to find God to bless this earth, we can hardly overcome anything.

1139360116106762_1139407172768723,"I remembered back in the 80's, people with disability can't find a job. We were treated liked an outcast. It was heartening to see that this days some people have come forward to accept us handicapped people as one society. 
Back then, I have to hide my disability in order to find job to support my sibling and my ailing mom. I learn to read lip, and 'read' body expression. But due to my hearing problem, when I misread their lip, I was label as stupid, slow, blur and retarded. And due to my hearing problem, when I talk, I don't know how to level my tone thus, people said I'm shouting at them or I talk like sua koo or I'm rude. I have to bear this everyday and I can't tell them that I'm a hearing impaired. But... there is an advantage to my disabilities. I 'read' people expression and I know what they like and dislike. I can sensed they are not comfortable with sudden things. And from the distant I can see their lip what they complain among themselves and I'm able to make them happy. It was a challenging job for me back then working in F&B. I love my job and I love making people happy despite my colleagues always label me as ""blur queen"" but thats ok... I handle my guests better then them thus I was given a training to be a trainer.  Now I'm old and had many health issue and plus I'm still taking care of my old mom. I can't work in the hospitality line. 
There was once I tried to apply but was told by the restaurant manager that I'm too old for that job. A month later, I went there as a customer.. indeed the staff are all young and beautiful. They smile sweetly. But they lack the  professionalisation on knowing their guest need. I enjoy my 5 mins telling the host on how to handle the guest traffic and was please that I still have that in me and I'm glad I was able to teach that young lady on how to deal with crowd control around the restaurant, even it mean I don't get a pay for it.
Even if you are disable if you have the passion and the love for your job.... you can still do well and I must say much better then able people. And us disable people only need the public to accept us  and not treat us as an outcast. Give us a chance to be part of the society.",Marie Johnson,24,2016-06-10 08:49:56

The cleaner, being not well educated dare not argue or fight for it for fear of being ""marked"" as difficult or worse, lose their job.

1139360116106762_1139458956096878,"Hi Mr Tan it would be good if plans can put in place to give the disabled more priority in public sector jobs. With our inclusive  educational facilities, more and more people with disabilities are getting well educated but the job market is still not open enough for us compared to the able bodied. Many SMEs and MNCs  are still afraid to hire us or take the time to do the necessary job redesign. As PWDs become a norm in public sector jobs i think it will encourage  a culture of inclusion within Singaporeans which will trickle down to the businesses they own. It will also encourage more interaction between both parties.  Currently it seems like even public sector HR managers are showing the same reservation as private sector when hiring the disabled.",Hari Jaganathan,2,2016-06-10 10:52:02

1139360116106762_1139470716095702,"Singapore still has a long way to go to become an inclusive society. With the kind of mindset of employers, or even that of the common lay people that a physically challenged person is regarded like a disease, we can never produce a person like Stephen Hawkings, Nic Vujicic to motivate the society to move forward. If government can set a quota in the hiring of foreign talents, how about setting a minimum quota in corporations or SME in the hiring of person with some form of disability? Give them rebates or tax relief to encourage the hiring process and encourage corporations to partner with VWOs or special schools to give these people proper training grounds to merge in with the society. How about a driving school for the special needs people like what Australia/ New Zealand is doing? Design special vehicle so the physically challenged can drive it.

1139360116106762_1139928179383289,"This is a classic example of pent-up frustration among us and releasing it on someone else. This is probably one of the many cases flagged out by the public. Singapore is not a very forgiving country .... especially when we see ourselves or might have been in similar positions. The focus should not just be on Mr Png. The child/ren of the foodcourt partron should also be on the radar. They could also be ""abused"". These should be considered the better after-effects of  stressed-up Singapore. Can our leaders do more to help the plight of individuals directly and address the root-causes of similar incidents? This brings back the depressing memory of an article highlighting the plight of a 60+ or higher dishwasher who died in the washing bay of  a hawker centre. We, or rather at least myself, can see that things are being done to prevent future causes (eg. getting Singaporean to focus on their talents instead of pursuing higher paying jobs, etc) and provide temp relief in assistance for the old age and so on, but those of us stuck in between, coming to 40 or 40+, are in the 欲哭无泪 position. Got a family to feed, bills to pay ... and highly-stressed up, cannot afford to lose job. The only way out ... eventually is prob when we die (but better be direct without incurring high hospital bills) and our family can rely on insurance payout to lighten their burden. Employees are like sergeant stuck in-between the man and the next-in-line. Please try not to expect private sector to take a cue from the govt on ""giving"" matters .... almost impossible. My best bet, if I am in the position to help,  ... help to allay our fears on basic living matters. Other typical Singapore issues (productivity, procreation, happiness-index score, competitiveness, filial piety issues, etc) will be resolved accordingly.  Side matters, from my daily read of the news, I am getting the impression that organisations are run very differently from the past, in silo and .... like a private business.

I insisted that she eat with me and I brought her lunch (she chose all the expensive food). Later, I walked with her to the Community Club to seek help from her MP as to connect her to MFS. Guess what happen?

CC counter staff and volunteer are not interested. She asked me (a passer-by in motorcycle) to bring her directly to the CDC. I was annoyed that not all the PA staff & volunteers are geniue passionate for their residents.

Minister Tan, I respect & salute u for the visitation. There are few passion people not related to GROs or Welfare Voluntarily Organisation, facing obstales when reaching out to the needy people in the market places. Please support them as they are doing good for the society.

Have a safe flight. I'm not sure if this airline made an announcement about switching of mobile phones when the doors were closed. Only certain aircraft types allow it for takeoff and landing. If one disobeys this, does that endanger the safety of all onboard? If so is that a threat to security sir?

I really want to live life as normally as possible, but there are still some existing barriers at this point in time, including social perception of people with disabilities. I know that sometimes people mean well, but unfortunately the way they convey their concern with the question 'what is wrong with you?' or 'what happened to you?' could be easily misinterpreted by some. Fortunately, I have friends who are very much willing to learn more and be understanding about my condition, and that I hope that other Singaporeans will be similarly as accepting of such diversity, to put it nicely :)",Riady Tay,2,2016-06-02 11:17:10

Things get more complicated for jobs that have unwritten expectations. Technically we are supposed to work not more than 12 hours a day and not more than 44 hours per week without OT pay.  However,  companies/organisations can circumvent this rule by 'requesting' employees knock off on time and yet still demand work to be done by the next morning. Employees would then have to either 'voluntarily ' work extra hours or even bring work home to complete it for fear of being reprimanded or receive a bad work appraisal. This is one of the many reasons that makes work culture in SG toxic to some =(",Weiwu Lah,0,2016-06-02 00:20:39

1124769984232442_1125398397502934,"Hi Minister Tan, just want to point out that monitor lizards are mostly carnivorous. It may look like it is digging for Heliconias, but its behavior is standard foraging behavior for prey. Notice the repeated flicking of its forked tongue, which works the same way as snakes in detecting potential prey under the soil. I think it picked up the scent of other small animals, possible underground grubs or even a rat/mouse nest.",Mervin Ang,0,2016-05-20 02:54:53

1118483031527804_1118631354846305,"June Siew , good point raise here... The structure of our housing system is the rental of the flat is for the disadvantaged group of people in our society. There are many criteria that one has to meet, before they are allow to rent HDB units at a fraction of a cost. However, once you move yourself slightly out of the disadvantaged bracket, the rental increases and things start to get a bit pricier, cos the system will need to cater the housing to the next disadvantaged group of people, at the same time, discourage you from getting too comfortable with the (low) rental system.
I perceive this as the ""gap"", u are slightly better than the disadvantage, but not good enough to own your own flat. Perhaps, Min. Tan CJ will be in a better position to advise you... 
I'll be more than willing to hear what he can share as it will be a good learning platform to understand how to better create the safety net (or trampoline) to catch people falling through these gaps",Sebas Ho,4,2016-05-09 22:10:56

1118483031527804_1118796274829813,"People are a lot more resilient than we realise, especially the older generation who grew up 'eating bitter'. They prefer to be self reliant and adjust to their own life circumstances. The important thing is to reach out to them, provide a listening ear and if they need help, let us know. Help is available and there is really no reason not to provide it if they are in need. 
But having said that, there are those whom we pity but do have family support, or are already being assisted, or who are reasonably comfortable with savings they have. They sometimes get trotted out, but those who do so rather do that than speak to them to find out in the first place. Please talk to them and just let us know and we follow up. 
eg. A lady messaged me recently about an old man sitting next to the staircase. He did look pitiful in the photo. But when we investigated, we found out that he lived upstairs and there were some family issues. They actually had a helper too that came down to look out for him every now and then. 
other eg. But there have also been those who do need the help and we have been able to provide them shelter or alternative solutions.

But not so fortunate for others elderly who has no kids or kids does not want to provide for them. But if I'm in their situation, 

I feel helpless cause there are really no laws for the government to provide for me and even my medical. 

Even though I know the government is trying. As for Singapore, aging populations is increasing. That why the government is pushing for 6.9 million population. It is a good move to cure the Aging population. If not we will be like current Japan.",Eric Tay,0,2016-05-10 06:37:27

I do agreed that finding a job is one of the solutions, as the elderly have something to depend on.

Stories Lived
Untold stories
Untellable stories
Unheard stories
Unknown stories 
Stories Told
Stories Telling 

LUUUUTT is a useful frame that can guide compassionate communicating n conversation. It's consistent with the narrative tradition n developed by communication theorist, Barnett Pearce (Coordinated Management of Meaning - CMM).

1118483031527804_1118696838173090,"A heartwarming story about resilience.

I had a recent chat with an elderly cardboard collector near my workplace and found out that she had rented out one of her rooms (she lives in a 3rm flat) for abt $400 a month to supplement her earnings of few hundred dollars a month. The less than $1k a mth was presumably alright for her to get by. When asked abt her family, she mentioned none of her children supported her, despite her having a mobility issue. Moving into an aged home was also out of question as the extended estate is her home with familiar things and people around her.

I suspect there are many senior folks living alone under such conditions and fiercely wanting to be independent.  

If such scenarios are prevalent, the Ministry might want to explore assisting them in another way albeit not conventional and maybe even controversial ; that is to help find tenants for their spare rooms and then using the rental earnings to engage part-time care takers to look after them. In essence, stepping into realm of their children's responsibilities.

In this manner, they get to keep their current flat, live in a familiar place, be surrounded by people they know and yet having some form of income to engage essential day care services. Just a suggestion and thanks for reading.",Wee Meng,16,2016-05-10 01:05:25

My VWO takes a group of mobility challenged elderly out on monthly outings. We will usually bring them out to a supermarket and provide them with a token sum in vouchers to shop and thereafter, we will buy them a meal before sending them back to the SAC. I believe it is the social interaction and the chance to go out and get a breath of fresh air that they look forward to, more so than the grocery shopping and meal.
You nailed it when you identified isolation as the key problem.

1118483031527804_1119561804753260,Jayley Athena Wang Xinhui Well said n agreed. We seen many old lady especially in their 60-70 collecting cardboards or clearing tables. I believed there are some financial reasons in the family which they won't want to burden their children especially their children  had their own family to support. Oldies at these ages should be enjoying life spending times with grandchildren or own life activities. Nowaday there's no job security & young generation people may have worries for more yrs to come especially when their children are still young.,Dorothy Lai,1,2016-05-11 11:27:19
1118483031527804_1119635531412554,"Actually while I do not disagree that there are elderly who struggles daily with their limited savings, and perhaps falling thru the cracks, we must also understand that the group of elderly today came from a generation where hard work and security were very important. It was a generation of survival, thus even when they are on Public Assistance, receiving some kind of assistance from other organisations, they will still rather work. But Why cleaning and collecting cardboards? 

Firstly, cleaning industry is always in need of people, and entry point is lower, thus ""easily obtained employment"", secondly, collecting of cardboards because it's free and can be easily resold. Our pioneers are a bunch of survivors, many a times rather work than depend on handouts. Thus, no matter how ""much"" they are given, they will still work... Thus to say cleaner and cardboard collectors are ""visible indications of a poorly managed country"" seems to be too generalized. In addition, culture plays a part too if we do comparison between countries. 

Nonetheless, we should always be on the lookout for families, seniors who need assistance, not only the MP, but the community at large should help to do reference to SSO, MPS if you spotted needy cases. 

We have one of the better social safety nets but it's only effective if we as a community look out for each other and help referred needy cases in the right directions.",Joewind Han,1,2016-05-11 14:09:42

Just like what you mentioned, moms always made time for their own children and went those extra extra miles on every front. Mothers, whether they are single parent or married, they deserve our respect and gratitude. I hope the single mothers will have the same parent benefits as well.",Vince Goh,0,2016-05-08 10:55:01

SG lifestyle needs a reformation , don't you think, Minister Tan?",Lois Nga,2,2016-05-08 11:17:00
1117526264956814_1117617124947728,"Well. I agree that we can all try harder. Questions we need to ponder though...Do we have choices to be exercised? Can we reprioritize? We sometimes describe these things like we are victims of circumstances and we have no role to play? Something individuals have to decide. When we talk of society at large, it's really a sum total of individual choices and lifestyles. There are things we can shape as a broader system but I do think a lot of it comes down to - do we think that spending time with our loved ones is worth our making effort to do so.",Tan Chuan-Jin,11,2016-05-08 11:52:02
